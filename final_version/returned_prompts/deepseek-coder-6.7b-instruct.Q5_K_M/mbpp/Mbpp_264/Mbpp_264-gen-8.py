def dog_age(human_age):
    return human_age * 7

print(dog_age(12)) # Expected output: 84

# Explanation:
# In the function dog_age, it takes human_age as an argument and returns its value multiplied by 7 which is the conversion rate between human and dog years.
# So, the human age of 12 years is equivalent to 84 years in dog years.
