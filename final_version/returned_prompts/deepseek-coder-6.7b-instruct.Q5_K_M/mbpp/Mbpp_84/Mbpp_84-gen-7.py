"""
Explanation:
The Newman-Conway sequence is a sequence of numbers that starts:
1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 16, 19, 22, 26, 31 etc.

This sequence is generated by taking the sum of two previous terms, starting from the third term. 
So, for the sequence [0, 1, 1], the next term is 2 (1+1), the next term is 2 (1+1), the next term is 3 (2+1), 
the next term is 4 (2+2), the next term is 5 (3+2), the next term is 6 (4+2), and so on.
"""

"""
Test case:
assert newman_conway(10) == 6
This is because 6 is the 10th number in the Newman-Conway sequence.
