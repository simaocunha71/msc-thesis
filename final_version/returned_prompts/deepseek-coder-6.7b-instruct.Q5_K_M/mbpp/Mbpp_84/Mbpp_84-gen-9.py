The Newman-Conway sequence is defined as follows:
- The first term is 1.
- Each subsequent term is determined by adding the previous term to the term before that.
- If a term has already been defined, use that term instead.

The first few numbers of the sequence are: 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 11, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 13, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 15, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 17, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 19, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20,
