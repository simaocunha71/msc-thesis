Here is a simple python function to find the nth number in the Newman-Conway sequence. 

The Newman-Conway sequence is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first two is the sum of the previous terms. 

The sequence starts like this: 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9, 10, 10, 11, 12, 12, 13, 14, 14, 15, 16, 16, 17, 18, 18, 19, 20, and so on.

The function takes an integer n as input and returns the nth number in the sequence.

We use the recursive approach to solve this problem. The base case for the recursion will be when n is 1 or 2, we return 1. For all other cases, we return the sum of the (n-1)th and (n-2)th terms.

def newman_conway(n):
    if n == 1 or n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        sequence = [0, 1, 1]
        for i in range(3, n + 1):
            sequence.append(sequence[sequence[i - 1]] + sequence[i - sequence[i - 1]])
        return sequence[n]

print(newman_conway(10)) # Output: 6

"""
The function works by first creating a list called sequence with the first three terms of the sequence (1, 1, and 2). Then, it iterates from 3 to n, appending to sequence the sum of the (n-1)th and (n-2)th terms of sequence. Finally, it returns the nth term of sequence.

This function has a time complexity of O(n) because it iterates through the sequence up to n. The space complexity is also O(n) because it stores the entire sequence up to n.
