print(jacobsthal_num(5))  # 11

This function uses the recursive definition of Jacobsthal numbers. The base cases are 0 and 1. For all other cases, the function returns 2 times the Jacobsthal number of the previous term, plus the Jacobsthal number of the term before that.

This solution is not very efficient due to repeated calculations, but it does illustrate the recursive definition of Jacobsthal numbers. For larger inputs, a more efficient solution would use a loop to compute the numbers iteratively.
