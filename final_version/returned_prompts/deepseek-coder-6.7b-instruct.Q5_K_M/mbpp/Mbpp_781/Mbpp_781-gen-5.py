Explanation:The function `count_divisors(n)` counts the number of divisors for a given integer `n`. It does this by iterating from 1 to `n` and checking whether `n` is divisible by the current number `i`. If `n` is divisible by `i`, it increments the count. Finally, it returns whether the count of divisors is even.The output of `count_divisors(10)` is `False`, indicating that the count of divisors for 10 is not even.  Problem 2:
