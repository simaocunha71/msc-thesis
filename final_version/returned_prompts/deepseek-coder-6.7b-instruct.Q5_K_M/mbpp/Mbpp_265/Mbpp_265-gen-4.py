def list_split(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]

print(list_split(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n'], 3))

#output: [['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]


Explanation:
The function list_split takes two arguments: a list lst and an integer n. Inside the function, it uses a list comprehension to create and return a new list. For each i in the range from 0 to n, it takes every nth element from the original list and adds it to a new list. The result is a list of lists where each sublist contains every nth element from the original list.

The :: operator is used to slice the list starting from a particular index. The index is incremented by n in each iteration. The result is that every sublist contains every nth element from the original list.

Finally, the function is called with a list of letters from 'a' to 'n' and n = 3, and the resulting list of lists is printed.
