Here is the Python function:

```python
def sort_sublists(lst):
    return [sorted(sublist) for sublist in lst]
```

This function uses list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list. The `sorted()` function is used to sort each sublist, and the result is a new list where each sublist is sorted.

The function `sort_sublists` takes a list of lists as input and returns a new list where each sublist is sorted.

The output list contains the sorted sublists of the input list.
