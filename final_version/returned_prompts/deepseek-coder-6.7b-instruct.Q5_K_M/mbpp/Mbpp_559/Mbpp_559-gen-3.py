# Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm is an efficient algorithm to solve this problem. 
# It uses dynamic programming to solve the problem in O(n) time. 
# The algorithm maintains a current sum of the subarray and maximum sum found so far. 
# If the current sum becomes negative, it resets to 0 because a negative sum is not contributing to the sum of the subarray. 
# If the current sum becomes larger than the maximum sum, it updates the maximum sum.
# At the end, the maximum sum is returned.

# This solution is also known as Kadane's Algorithm.

# Kadane's Algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm that solves the maximum subarray sum problem in O(n) time.
# It works by iterating over the array and at each step, it updates the current sum and the maximum sum. 
# If the current sum becomes negative, it is reset to 0. 
# If the current sum becomes larger than the maximum sum, the maximum sum is updated. 
# At the end, the maximum sum is returned.

# This algorithm is known as Kadane's Algorithm because the author's name, Kadane, was mentioned in the paper.

# This algorithm is used in many programming interviews to test the candidate's understanding of dynamic programming. 
# It is a common problem in computer science education and is often used as a prelude to more complex dynamic programming problems.

# This solution is also known as Kadane's Algorithm.
