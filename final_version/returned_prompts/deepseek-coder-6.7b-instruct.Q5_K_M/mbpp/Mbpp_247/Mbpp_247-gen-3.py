"""
The function lps(s) will return the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the string s.

The function works by creating a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the substring s[i..j]. 

For each substring, it first checks if the first and last characters are the same. If so, it adds 2 to the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the substring without the first and last characters (which is dp[i+1][j-1]). 

If the first and last characters are not the same, it takes the maximum of the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the substring without the first character (dp[i+1][j]) and the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the substring without the last character (dp[i][j-1]).

Finally, it returns dp[0][n-1], where n is the length of the string s.
