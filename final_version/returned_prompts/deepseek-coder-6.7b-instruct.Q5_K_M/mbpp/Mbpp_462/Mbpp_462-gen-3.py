Explanation:

The function `combinations_list` takes a list `lst` as input. It uses a for loop to iterate over the range from 0 to 2^len(lst)-1, where 2^len(lst) gives us the total number of combinations. For each number i in this range, it constructs a combination by adding the elements of lst to the current combination if the i-th bit is set. This is done using a bitwise operation to check if the i-th bit is set in i. If it is set, the corresponding element of lst is added to the current combination. This process is repeated for all numbers in the range, and the resulting combinations are added to the list result. The function then returns this list.

The bitwise operation `i & (1 << j)` checks if the j-th bit in the binary representation of i is set. If it is set, the expression `i & (1 << j)` is non-zero, and we add the j-th element of lst to the current combination. If it is not set, the expression `i & (1 << j)` is zero, and we do not add the j-th element of lst to the current combination.

The function `combinations_list` therefore returns a list of all possible combinations of the elements of the input list, including the empty
