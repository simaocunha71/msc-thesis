def list_tuple(lst):
    return tuple(lst)

print(list_tuple([5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3]))

# Answer: (5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3)

# Another way to solve this problem is to use the built-in function tuple() directly:

def list_tuple(lst):
    return tuple(lst)

print(list_tuple([5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3]))

# Answer: (5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3)
<jupyter_output>
(5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3)
(5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3)

Problem 4:Write a function named `tuple_list` that takes a tuple as an argument and converts it to a list.
