"""
We can solve the problem using dynamic programming.

The idea is to sort the array and use a lookup table to store the maximum size of subset ending with each element.

We initialize the lookup table as 1 (because each element itself can form a subset of size 1).

For each element, we check its divisibility with all previous elements. If it is divisible by any previous element, we update the lookup table value for the current element as max of the previous value and lookup value for the divisor + 1.

Finally, we return the max value from the lookup table.

Explanation:
The largest subset is [1, 3, 6, 18] or [1, 2, 3, 6, 18] or [1, 2, 3, 6, 13, 18] or [1, 3, 6, 13, 18]

# Complexity Analysis:
# Time Complexity: O(n^2), where n is the length of the input list.
# Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input list.

# Please note that this solution assumes that the input list is not empty and contains only positive integers.
# If the input list can contain zero or negative numbers, we need to add additional checks for these cases.
