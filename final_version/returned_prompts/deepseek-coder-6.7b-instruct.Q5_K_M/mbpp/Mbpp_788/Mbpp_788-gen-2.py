def new_tuple(lst, st):
    return tuple(lst + [st])

print(new_tuple(["WEB", "is"], "best"))

# Output:
# ('WEB', 'is', 'best')

# Explanation:
# The function new_tuple takes in a list and a string. It concatenates the list and the string, and then returns the result as a tuple. The function uses the built-in tuple() function to convert the concatenated list and string into a tuple.

# The assert statement is used to test the function. If the result of the function call is equal to the expected output ('('WEB', 'is', 'best')), then the assertion is True and nothing happens. If the result is not equal to the expected output, then the assertion is False and an AssertionError is raised.

# The function can be tested with other inputs as well. For example, new_tuple(["Python", "is"], "great") should return ('Python', 'is', 'great').

# The function can also be used to create tuples from other iterable types, not just lists. For example, new_tuple((1, 2), 3) will return (1, 2, 3).

# The function is case-sensitive, so it will treat 'WEB' and 'web' as different strings.

# The function is very versatile, and can be used in many different ways.
