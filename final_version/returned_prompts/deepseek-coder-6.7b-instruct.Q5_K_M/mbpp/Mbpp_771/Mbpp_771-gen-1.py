# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(n) in the worst case when we have a string of n elements with all opening brackets.

# Additional:
# The function works by iterating through the string. When it encounters an opening bracket, it pushes it onto a stack.
# When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty or the last opening bracket doesn't match the current closing bracket.
# If these conditions are met, it returns False. If the stack is empty at the end (which means all brackets were matched), it returns True.
# The function assumes that the input string only contains brackets.

# Note: This solution assumes that the input string is a valid expression. If the string might contain invalid characters,
# additional error checking would be needed.
# Also note that this solution is case sensitive. If you want to make it case insensitive, you could convert the input string to lowercase or uppercase before processing it.

# Further improvements could be made by handling different types of brackets and different types of expressions.
# For instance, this solution might work with any type of brackets, not just round ones, but it would need to be adapted accordingly.
# Also, it might not work with expressions that contain spaces or other characters. Adjustments would be needed to handle those cases.
# Also, it might not work with nested expressions. If you need to handle nested expressions, a recursive approach would be needed.
# This solution could also be improved by using a dictionary to map opening brackets to closing brackets, which would make the code more readable and easier to maintain.
# However, these improvements would make the code more complex.

# In conclusion, this solution should work well for many common use cases, but there are many ways it could be
