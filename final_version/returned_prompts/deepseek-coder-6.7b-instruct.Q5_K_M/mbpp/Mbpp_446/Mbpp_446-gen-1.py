Explanation:
The function count_Occurrence(tup, lst) takes a tuple and a list as arguments. 
It initializes a variable count to 0. 
Then it loops over the elements of the list lst. 
For each element i in lst, it adds the count of i in the tuple tup to count.
Finally, it returns the value of count.
This count is the total number of occurrences of the elements of lst in tup.
