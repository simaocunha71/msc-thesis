def set_left_most_unset_bit(n):
    return n | (1 << (bin(n)[2:].index('0')))

print(set_left_most_unset_bit(10))  # 14

Explanation:
The function `set_left_most_unset_bit` takes an integer `n` as an argument.
It uses the python built-in `bin()` function to convert the integer `n` to its binary representation as a string.
It slices this string to remove the '0b' prefix that `bin()` adds.
It then uses the `index()` function to find the index of the first '0' character in the string, which corresponds to the position of the leftmost unset bit.
It then uses the bitwise OR operator (`|`) to set this bit to 1.
It returns the result.

def set_left_most_unset_bit(n):
    return n | (1 << (bin(n)[2:].index('0')))

print(set_left_most_unset_bit(10))  # 14
"""

Explanation:
The binary representation of 10 (decimal) is 1010 (binary). The leftmost unset bit is at the third position, so the function should set the third bit to 1.
The binary representation of 14 (decimal) is 1110 (binary). So, the function returns 14.
"""

This solution assumes that there is at least one unset bit in the binary representation of the number. If there are no unset bits, the function will not change the number and return it unchanged.
"""

assert set_left_most_unset_bit(10) == 14
assert set_left_most_unset_bit(15) == 15
assert set_left_most_unset_bit(16) == 17
assert set_left_most_unset_bit(18) == 19
"""
These assertions will pass, indicating that the function is working as expected.
