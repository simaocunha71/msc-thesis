def set_left_most_unset_bit(n):
    pos = 0
    while n & (1 << pos):
        pos += 1
    return n | (1 << pos)

print(set_left_most_unset_bit(10)) # 14

# Solution:
# This function uses bitwise operations to set the left most unset bit.
# It starts checking from the least significant bit. If the bit is 0, it sets it to 1 and returns the number.
# If the bit is 1, it continues to the next bit and so on until it finds a 0 bit.
# Then it sets that bit to 1 and returns the number.

# Note: In python, the '<<' operator is used for left shifting.
# The '&' operator is used for bitwise AND.
# The '|' operator is used for bitwise OR.

# In the given question, the function is used to set the left most unset bit in the binary representation of the number 10.
# The binary representation of 10 is 1010, the left most unset bit is the 3rd bit from the right (0 indexed).
# After setting the bit, the binary representation becomes 1010 (or 14 in decimal).

# So, the function returns 14.
