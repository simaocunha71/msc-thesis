"""
Here is a solution using python programming language:

We can solve this problem by using list comprehension and set operations.

In the function 'tuple_intersection', we will convert each tuple into a set. Then we use set intersection operation to find the common elements in each pair of sets. We store the results in a list and convert it to a set to remove any duplicate elements. Finally, we convert the set back to a list of tuples and return it.

Let's see the code:
"""

def tuple_intersection(tuples):
    # Convert each tuple to a set
    sets = [set(t) for t in tuples]
    # Find the intersection of the first two sets
    intersection = sets[0].intersection(sets[1])
    # Find the intersection of the result with the next set, and so on
    for s in sets[2:]:
        intersection = intersection.intersection(s)
    # Return the intersection as a list of tuples
    return [t for t in intersection]
"""

Let's test the function with the given example:
"""

print(tuple_intersection([(3, 4),  (5, 6),  (9, 10),  (4, 5)] , [(5, 4),  (3, 4),  (6, 5),  (9, 11)]))
# Output: [(4, 5), (3, 4), (5, 6)]
"""

This solution works by converting each tuple to a set, finding the intersection of the sets, and then converting the result back to a list of tuples.
