print(odd_values_values_string('abcdef'))

"""
Explanation:
The function odd_values_string takes a string s as input. The string indexing syntax s[::2] is used to get every second character from the string starting from the first character. This means all characters with even indices (0, 2, 4, etc.) are returned, thus effectively removing those with odd indices (1, 3, 5, etc.).
