Output:
[1]
"""

Explanation:
The function Find_Min iterates through the list of lists and keeps track of the list with the minimum length. When it finds a list that has a smaller length than the current minimum, it updates the minimum length and the corresponding list. The function finally returns the list with the smallest length.

This solution assumes that the input list is non-empty and contains at least one list. If this is not the case, additional error checking would be necessary.
