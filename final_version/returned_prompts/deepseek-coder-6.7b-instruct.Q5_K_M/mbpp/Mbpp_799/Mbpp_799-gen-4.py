"""
The function works by first shifting the bits of the number to the left by d places. This effectively removes the last d bits from the number. Then it shifts the remaining bits to the right by d places, effectively moving the d bits that were removed to the leftmost position. Finally, it combines these two operations using the bitwise OR operator.

# In Python, the '<<' operator is used for left shift and '>>' for right shift. The '|' operator is used for bitwise OR.
# The function works by first shifting the bits of the number to the left by d places. This effectively removes the last d bits from the number.
# Then it shifts the remaining bits to the right by 32-d places, effectively moving the d bits that were removed to the leftmost position.
# Finally, it combines these two operations using the bitwise OR operator.
