Here is a simple Python solution:

```python
def left_rotate(n, d):
    return (n << d)|(n >> (32 - d))
```

In the function, `n << d` is equivalent to n being multiplied by 2^d, which is equivalent to rotating n's bits to the left by d places. 

`n >> (32 - d)` is equivalent to n being divided by 2^(32-d), which is equivalent to rotating n's bits to the right by 32 - d places.

The '|' operator is used to combine these two operations.

This function works by rotating the bits in the number n to the left by d places.
