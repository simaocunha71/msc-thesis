def sum_square_nums(nums):
    return sum([num ** 2 for num in nums])

print(sum_square_nums([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]))

# Output:
# 385

# Explanation:
# The function `sum_square_nums` takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the sum of squares of all the numbers in the list.
# This is achieved using list comprehension which creates a new list of squared numbers and `sum` function which calculates the sum of all the elements in the list.
