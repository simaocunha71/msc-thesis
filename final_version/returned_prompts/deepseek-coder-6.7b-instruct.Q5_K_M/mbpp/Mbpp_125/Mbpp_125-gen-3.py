# The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string.

# The space complexity of the solution is O(1), because it uses a constant amount of space to store the count of zeros and ones and the maximum difference.

# This solution iterates through the string once, keeping track of the counts of zeros and ones and updating the maximum difference at each step. It then returns the maximum difference found.

# The maximum difference is the maximum difference between the number of 0s and 1s in any sub-string of the given binary string.

# This solution assumes that the input string is a binary string (containing only 0s and 1s). If the string can contain other characters, the solution would need to be modified accordingly.
