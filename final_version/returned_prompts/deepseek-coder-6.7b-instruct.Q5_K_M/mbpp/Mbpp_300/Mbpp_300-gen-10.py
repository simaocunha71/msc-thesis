"""
This function uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of binary sequences. The DP array dp[i] stores the number of binary sequences of length i that satisfy the condition. For each i, it calculates dp[i] by summing over all j in the range from 0 to i - 1, multiplying dp[j] and dp[i - j - 1] to get the number of binary sequences of length i that can be formed by concatenating two binary sequences of length j and i - j - 1.

If i is even, it subtracts the number of binary sequences of length i // 2 from the sum to exclude sequences where the first half and the last half have different sums of bits. This is because the sum of the first half and the last half cannot be the same when i is even.

Finally, it returns dp[2 * n], which is the number of binary sequences of length 2n that satisfy the condition.
