def count_binary_seq(n):
    # initialize the count to 0
    count = 0
    # iterate from 0 to 2^(2n)
    for i in range(2**(2*n)):
        # convert the number to binary and remove the '0b' prefix
        bin_str = bin(i)[2:].zfill(2*n)
        # check if the sum of the first n bits is equal to the sum of the last n bits
        if sum(int(bin_str[j]) for j in range(n)) == sum(int(bin_str[j]) for j in range(n, 2*n)):
            # increment the count if the condition is met
            count += 1
    # return the count
    return count

# test the function
print(count_binary_seq(1))  # should return 2

Note: The time complexity of the function is O(2^(2n)) because it has to generate all the possible binary sequences of length 2n and check each one to see if the sum of the first n bits is equal to the sum of the last n bits. This is not very efficient and could be improved by using dynamic programming or by realizing that the count of binary sequences of length 2n that satisfy the condition is a number that can be calculated directly using combinatorics.
