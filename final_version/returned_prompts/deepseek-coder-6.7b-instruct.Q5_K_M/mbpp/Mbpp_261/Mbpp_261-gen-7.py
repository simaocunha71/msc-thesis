def division_elements(t1, t2):
    return tuple(x1 / x2 for x1, x2 in zip(t1, t2))

print(division_elements((10, 4, 6, 9),(5, 2, 3, 3)))

# Expected Output:
# (2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 3.0)

"""
Explanation:
The function "division_elements" takes two tuples as input. It uses the built-in function "zip" to iterate over two tuples simultaneously. It then uses a generator expression to perform division operation on each pair of elements and returns a tuple.
