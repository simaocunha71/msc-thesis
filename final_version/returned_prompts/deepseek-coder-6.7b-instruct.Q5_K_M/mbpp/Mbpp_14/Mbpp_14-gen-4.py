def find_Volume(base,height,length):
    return (base * height * length) // 2

# Test Cases
print(find_Volume(10,8,6)) # Expected output is 240

# The above program works by taking base, height, and length as arguments and using the formula to calculate the volume of a triangular prism.
# The function returns the volume.

# The '//' operator is used instead of '/' for integer division. This is because the volume of a prism is always a whole number.

# If the function is called with the given test case, it should return 240.
