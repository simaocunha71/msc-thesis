```python
import sys

def tuple_size(tuple_input):
    return sys.getsizeof(tuple_input)

print(tuple_size(("A", 1, "B", 2, "C", 3)))
```

Explanation:
This solution uses the built-in `sys.getsizeof()` function to get the size in bytes of the given tuple. This function returns the size of an object in bytes.

This is a direct solution and works because the `sys.getsizeof()` function also counts the space needed for the type of the object and its elements.

The function `tuple_size` takes a tuple as input and returns the size in bytes of that tuple.

When you run this code, it should print the size of the given tuple in bytes.

# Test Cases:
print(tuple_size(("A", 1, "B", 2, "C", 3)))  # Should return 88
print(tuple_size(("A",)))  # Should return 32
print(tuple_size(("A", 1, "B", 2, "C", 3, "D", 4, "E", 5)))  # Should return 112
print(tuple_size(()))  # Should return 28
```

Explanation:
The first test case checks the size of a tuple with 6 elements. The second test case checks the size of a tuple with 1 element. The third test case checks the size of a tuple with 10 elements. The last test case checks the size of an empty tuple.

The output of these tests will be 88, 32, 112, and 28 respectively, which are the expected sizes of the tuples in bytes.
