"""
In a right angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. We can use this property to solve the problem.

Here is the python function:
"""
import math
def otherside_rightangle(a, b):
    return math.sqrt(a**2 + b**2)
"""
This function takes two arguments: the lengths of the other two sides of the right-angled triangle. It returns the length of the third side. We use the math.sqrt function to calculate the square root.
"""

T:
"""
Test the function with the provided test case:
"""

print(otherside_rightangle(7,8)) # expected output: 10.63014581273465


E:
"""
This function should work for any two positive numbers as the lengths of the two sides of the triangle. It should return the correct length of the third side of the triangle.

**Test case**
<jupyter_code>
# Test the function
print(otherside_rightangle(7,8)) # expected output: 10.63014581273465

**Expected output**: 10.63014581273465  **Explanation**: The function works by applying the Pythagorean theorem (which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides), which states that c^2 = a^2 + b^2. The function takes in the lengths of the two sides of the triangle and calculates the third side using this theorem.  **Complexity**: The complexity of the function is O(1), as it performs a constant number of operations regardless of the input size.  **Efficiency**: The function is efficient as it performs a simple calculation and does not involve
