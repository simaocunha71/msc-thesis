Here is a simple python function to solve the problem:

```python
import math

def otherside_rightangle(a, b):
    return math.sqrt(a**2 + b**2)

print(otherside_rightangle(7, 8))
```
This function uses the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the third side of a right-angled triangle. The theorem states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

When you run this code, it will print: "10.63014581273465".
