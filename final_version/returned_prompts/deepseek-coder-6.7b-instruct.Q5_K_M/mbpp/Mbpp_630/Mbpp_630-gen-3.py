In this code, we first define the function get_coordinates that takes a coordinate as input. Inside the function, we first extract the x and y coordinates from the input tuple. Then, we create a list of all the possible adjacent coordinates. We filter out the coordinates that are outside the grid by checking if 0 <= x < 5 and 0 <= y < 5. Finally, we return the list of adjacent coordinates.

Note: This code assumes that the grid is a 5x5 grid. If you want to use this code for a different size grid, you can change the values in the assert statement and the return statement.

In this code, we only consider the horizontal and vertical adjacent coordinates, which are the only possible adjacent coordinates in a 2D grid. This reduces the number of adjacent coordinates to 4, which is the minimum number of adjacent coordinates in a 2
