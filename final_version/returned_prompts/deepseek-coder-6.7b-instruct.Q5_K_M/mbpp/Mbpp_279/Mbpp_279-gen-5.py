# Note:
# A decagonal number is a figurate number that extends the concept of triangular and square numbers to the plane.
# The nth decagonal number is given by the formula: n*(7n-5)/2.
# The formula is derived from the geometry of decagonal numbers.
# The first few decagonal numbers are: 1, 9, 20, 34, 51, 71, 94, 120, 149, 181, 216, 254, 295, 339, 386, 436, 489, 545, 604, 666, ...
