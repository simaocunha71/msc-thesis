#Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

Explanation:
This Python function uses a for loop to iterate over each number in the range from the start number to the end number. 
It then checks if the square root of the number (i**0.5) is an integer (int(i**0.5)). 
If it is, it means the number is a perfect square and it adds it to the result list.
Finally, it returns the result list.
