Explanation:
The function takes two parameters, the start and end of the range. It then iterates over each number in the range.
In the if condition, it checks if the square root of the number, when rounded down and then squared, is equal to the original number. 
If this condition is satisfied, the number is a perfect square and is appended to the result list. The function then returns the result list.

"""
Here, the function is checking for perfect squares in the range 1 to 30 (inclusive). The perfect squares in this range are 1, 4, 9, 16, and 25. Therefore, the function returns the list [1, 4, 9, 16, 25] when called with the parameters 1 and 30. The assert statement is also true, so the function passes the test.
