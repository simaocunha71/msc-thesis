"""
Here is a Python solution using the Pancake sort algorithm.

Pancake sort is a simple algorithm that sorts a disordered list of items by making the smallest item the largest item, and then the second smallest the second largest, and so on, until the list is sorted.

Here is a step by step breakdown of the algorithm:
1. Find the largest item in the list and flip it to the front.
2. Find the second largest item and flip it to the second position.
3. Repeat these steps for the rest of the list.

This algorithm works by repeatedly flipping sections of the list until it is sorted.

This code takes a list of integers as input, sorts it using the pancake sort algorithm, and returns the sorted list. The function works by repeatedly flipping sections of the list until it is sorted.
