"""
Explanation:
The function first initializes a list binomial_coeff with a first element 1 and n zeros. This list will store the binomial coefficients of the binomial series.

Then it iterates over the range of n+1. For each i, it computes the next binomial coefficient by adding the (i-1)th binomial coefficient to the (i-2)th binomial coefficient and so on, until it reaches the 0th binomial coefficient.

It also checks if the current binomial coefficient is at an even index. If it is, it adds the coefficient to the sum sum_evens.

Finally, it returns the sum sum_evens.
"""

"""
This function works by using dynamic programming to keep track of the binomial coefficients as it calculates them. It then sums up the coefficients at even indices. The time complexity of this function is O(n^2) because there are two nested loops, and the space complexity is O(n) for the binomial_coeff list.
