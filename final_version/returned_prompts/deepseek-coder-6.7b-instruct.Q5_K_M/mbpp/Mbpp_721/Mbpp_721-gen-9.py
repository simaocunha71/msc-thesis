This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to keep track of the maximum average path in a bottom-up manner.

We create a dp table of size (N+1, N+1) where dp[i][j] represents the maximum average path from the top-left cell (0, 0) to the cell (i, j).

We initialize dp[0][0] with the cost of the top-left cell, and dp[i][0] and dp[0][i] with negative infinity (since we can't move right or down from these cells).

We then fill up the dp table in a bottom-up manner. For each cell (i, j), we consider the maximum average path that ends at the cell above it (dp[i-1][j]) or the cell to its left (dp[i][j-1]). We take the maximum of these two values and add the cost of the current cell to get the maximum average path for the current cell.

Finally, we return the maximum average path for the bottom-right cell.

Here is the Python code for this approach:

```python
def maxAverageOfPath(matrix):
    N = len(matrix)
    dp = [[-float('inf')]*(N+1) for _ in range(N+1)]
    dp[0][1] = dp[1][0] = 0
    for i in range(1, N+1):
        for j in range(1, N+1):
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + matrix[i-1][j-1]
    return max(dp[-1]) / (N-1)

print(maxAverageOfPath([[1, 2, 3], [6, 5, 4], [7, 3, 9]]))  # 5.2
```

This code runs in O(N^2) time and uses O(N^2) space.
