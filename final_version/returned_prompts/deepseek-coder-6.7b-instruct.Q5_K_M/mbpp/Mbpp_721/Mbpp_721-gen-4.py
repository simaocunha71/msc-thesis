"""
The problem is about finding the path with the maximum average cost in a grid. We can solve this problem by dynamic programming.

We use a 2D dp array where dp[i][j] represents the maximum average cost of the path that ends at cell (i, j). We initialize the dp[0][j] and dp[i][0] to be the cumulative sum of the cost from the first cell to the cell (i, j). Then for each cell (i, j), we calculate the dp[i][j] by taking the maximum between dp[i - 1][j] and dp[i][j - 1] plus the cost of the cell (i, j).

Finally, the maximum average cost is the maximum value in the dp array.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N^2) and the space complexity is O(N^2).
