Firstly, you should understand that the problem is asking to remove uneven elements in the nested mixed tuple. This means that the function should recursively go through all the elements in the tuple and check if they are uneven. If they are uneven, they should be removed.

Here is the function written in Python:
"""
def extract_even(tup):
    result = []
    for i in tup:
        if type(i) == tuple:
            result.append(extract_even(i))
        elif i % 2 == 0:
            result.append(i)
    return tuple(result)
"""
In this function, we use a recursive approach to go through each element in the tuple. If the element is a tuple, we recursively call the function on it. If the element is not a tuple and it is even, we append it to the result list. In the end, we convert the result list to a tuple and return it.
"""

print(extract_even((4, 5, (7, 6, (2, 4)), 6, 8))) # Output: (4, (6, (2, 4)), 6, 8)

This function works by first checking if the element is a tuple. If it is, it recursively calls the function on that tuple. If it's not a tuple, it checks if the element is even. If it is, it appends the element to the result list. In the end, it converts the result list to a tuple and returns it.
