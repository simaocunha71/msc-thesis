"""
The problem can be solved using Python's built-in itertools library which provides a function called combinations that generates all possible combinations of a given iterable.
"""

```python
from itertools import combinations

def find_combinations(lst):
    result = []
    for i in range(1, len(lst) + 1):
        for comb in combinations(lst, i):
            result.append(tuple(sum(x) for x in zip(*comb)))
    return result
```

Test the function:

```python
assert find_combinations([(2, 4), (6, 7), (5, 1), (6, 10)]) == [(8, 11), (7, 5), (8, 14), (11, 8), (12, 17), (11, 11)]
```

Explanation:

The function find_combinations takes a list of tuples as input. It uses itertools.combinations to generate all possible combinations of the tuples of the given length, from 1 to the length of the input list. For each combination, it sums the corresponding elements of the tuples and appends the result to the result list. The function returns the result list.

The result list is a list of tuples where each tuple is a pair of sums that can be obtained by adding corresponding elements from the input tuples. For example, if the input is [(2, 4), (6, 7), (5, 1), (6, 10)], the result is [(8, 11), (7, 5), (8, 14), (11, 8), (12, 17), (11, 11)], which are the pairs of sums that can be obtained by adding corresponding elements from the input tuples.
