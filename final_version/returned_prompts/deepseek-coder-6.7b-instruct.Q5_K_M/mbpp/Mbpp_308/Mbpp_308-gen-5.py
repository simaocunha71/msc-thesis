"""
Explanation:
The function takes three arguments - two lists and an integer n. It initializes an empty list, products.
It uses two nested loops to find all possible products of numbers from the two lists and appends them to the products list.
Then, it sorts the products list in descending order.
Finally, it returns the first n elements from the sorted list, which represent the largest n products.
