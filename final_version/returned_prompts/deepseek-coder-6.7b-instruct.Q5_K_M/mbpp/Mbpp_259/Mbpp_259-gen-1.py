Here is the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
def maximize_elements(t1, t2):
    return tuple(tuple(max(x, y) for x, y in zip(a, b)) for a, b in zip(t1, t2))
```

In this code, we use a combination of `zip` and `tuple` to iterate over the two input tuples in parallel. For each pair of tuples, we find the maximum element by using the `max` function. The result is a new tuple where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements in the input tuples.

Now let's test the function:

```python
print(maximize_elements(((1, 3), (4, 5), (2, 9), (1, 10)), ((6, 7), (3, 9), (1, 1), (7, 3))))
```

This should output:

```
((6, 7), (4, 9), (2, 9), (7, 10))
```

This matches the expected result in the problem statement.
