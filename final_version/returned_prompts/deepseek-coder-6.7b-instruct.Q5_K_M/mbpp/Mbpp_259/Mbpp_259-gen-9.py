# The function works by using the built-in zip function to pair up the corresponding elements from the two tuples. 
# It then uses the max function to find the maximum of each pair, effectively comparing and maximizing the corresponding elements from the two tuples. 
# The result is a new tuple of maximum values. 
# This solution assumes that the two tuples have the same length and that each pair of tuples has the same length.

# The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the tuples, because it needs to traverse all the elements in the tuples once.
# The space complexity is also O(n), because the function creates a new tuple of the same length as the input tuples.
