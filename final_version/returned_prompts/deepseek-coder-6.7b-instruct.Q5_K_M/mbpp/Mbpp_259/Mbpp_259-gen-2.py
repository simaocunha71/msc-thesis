"""
The function `maximize_elements` takes two tuples as inputs. It iterates over the elements of the tuples in parallel (because of the `range(len(t1))`), and for each pair of elements in the tuples, it forms a new tuple with the maximum of the corresponding elements from each input tuple. The resulting tuple is returned by the function.

The given test case has passed successfully. The function works as expected.
