Here is the Python function for the problem:

```python
def add_dict_to_tuple(tup, dic):
    lst = list(tup)
    lst.append(dic)
    return tuple(lst)

print(add_dict_to_tuple((4, 5, 6), {"MSAM"  : 1, "is"  : 2, "best"  : 3}))
```

When you run this code, it will return `(4, 5, 6, {'MSAM': 1, 'is': 2, 'best': 3})` as expected.

Explanation:
The function `add_dict_to_tuple` takes a tuple and a dictionary as input. It converts the tuple to a list using the `list()` function. The dictionary is appended to the list using `append()`. Then, the list is converted back to a tuple using `tuple()`. The tuple is then returned by the function.
