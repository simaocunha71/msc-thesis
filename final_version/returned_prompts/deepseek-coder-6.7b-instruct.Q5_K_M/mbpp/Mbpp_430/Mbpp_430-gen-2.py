"""
The area of a trapezoid can be calculated using the formula:
Area = 0.5*(a+b)*h

Here, a and b are the lengths of the parallel sides and h is the height of the trapezoid.

Here is the python code for the same:
"""

def trapezoid_area(a, b, h):
    return 0.5*(a+b)*h

print(trapezoid_area(5,3,2))
assert trapezoid_area(5,3,2)==12.5

"""
The function returns the area of the trapezoid.
