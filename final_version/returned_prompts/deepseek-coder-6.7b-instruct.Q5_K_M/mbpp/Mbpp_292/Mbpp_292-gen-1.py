Here is the Python function to find the quotient of two numbers (rounded down to the nearest integer):

```python
def find(num1, num2):
    return num1 // num2

print(find(10, 3))  # Output: 3
```

In the above function, the double slash `//` is used for integer division, which rounds the result down to the nearest integer.

Please replace `num1` and `num2` with the numbers you want to find the quotient of.

This function will return the quotient of these two numbers.

Here, `10` is divided by `3`, which equals `3.33`. When this value is rounded down to the nearest integer, it becomes `3`. So, the function returns `3`.

I hope this helps you understand how to find the quotient of two numbers in Python.
