print(median_trapezium(15, 25, 35))

# Output: 20.0

# This function calculates the median length of a trapezium by taking the average of the lengths of the three sides. The median line divides the trapezium into two equal parts, so the average of the lengths of the three sides gives a point at which the median line intersects the trapezium.
