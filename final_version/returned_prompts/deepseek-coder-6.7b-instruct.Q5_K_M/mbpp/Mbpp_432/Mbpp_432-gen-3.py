def median_trapezium(a, b, c):
    return (a+b+c)/2

print(median_trapezium(15,25,35))

#assert median_trapezium(15,25,35)==20
#assert False, "Test Failed"

# Note: The above code snippet will work if the lengths of the trapezium are given as the lengths of its two parallel sides and the median line. If you have the lengths of the trapezium's sides, you need to calculate them first.
