Here is the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
import heapq

def heap_queue_largest(numbers, n):
    return heapq.nlargest(n, numbers)
```

This function uses the `heapq.nlargest` method, which returns the n largest elements from the iterable specified in descending order.

Let's test the function with the given example:

```python
print(heap_queue_largest([25, 35, 22, 85, 14, 65, 75, 22, 58], 3))  # Output: [85, 75, 65]
```

This function works by using a heap to efficiently find the n largest elements from the input list. The time complexity is O(n log k), where n is the number of elements in the list and k is the number of largest elements to find.
"""

def heap_queue_largest(numbers, k):
    heap = []
    for num in numbers:
        heapq.heappush(heap, num)
        if len(heap) > k:
            heapq.heappop(heap)
    return sorted(heap, reverse=True)

print(heap_queue_largest([25, 35, 22, 85, 14, 65, 75, 22, 58], 3))  # Output: [85, 75, 65]
