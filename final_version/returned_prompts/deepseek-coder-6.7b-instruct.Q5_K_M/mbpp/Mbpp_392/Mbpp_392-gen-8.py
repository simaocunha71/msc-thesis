The problem is asking to find the maximum sum possible by using the given equation f(n) = max(f(n/2) + f(n/3) + f(n/4) + f(n/5), n). The function takes an input n and returns the maximum of two sums. One sum is the sum of the f values obtained by dividing n by 2, 3, 4, and 5 recursively, and the other sum is the value of n itself.

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming by storing the computed f values in a list. This way, when we need to calculate f(n), we can look up the stored value if it exists, rather than recalculating it.

Here is a Python solution using dynamic programming:
"""

def get_max_sum(n):
    # Initialize list to store computed f values
    f_values = [0]*(n+1)

    # Compute f values for 1 to n
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        f_values[i] = max(f_values[i//2] + f_values[i//3] + f_values[i//4] + f_values[i//5], i)

    # Return computed f value for n
    return f_values[n]

# Test the function
print(get_max_sum(60))  # Outputs: 106

"""
This function creates a list f_values where each index i represents the maximum sum that can be obtained by using the equation f(n) = max(f(n/2) + f(n/3) + f(n/4) + f(n/5), n) for n = i. The function then fills this list by iterating from 1 to n, computing the maximum sum for each n, and storing it in the list. Finally, it returns the computed maximum sum for the input n.
"""

# The time complexity of this solution is O(n) and the space complexity is also O(n) as it uses a list of size n to store the computed f values.

# Note that this solution assumes that the input n is a positive integer. If the input can be a non-integer or negative
