The function works by iterating over the tuples. For each tuple, it uses the built-in zip function to create a new tuple with the corresponding elements of the two input tuples. It then multiplies those elements together and appends the result to a new list. After all tuples have been processed, it converts the list back into a tuple and returns the result.

Note: The output is a tuple of tuples. If you want a flattened tuple, you can modify the function to flatten the result after it is computed.
