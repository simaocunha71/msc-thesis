Explanation:
This function takes two tuples as input. It iterates over the length of the first tuple (tup1), and for each iteration, it multiplies the elements of tup1 and tup2 at the current index and creates a new tuple with the result. This new tuple is then added to a list (res). After the loop finishes, the function returns a new tuple created from the list res.

"""
assert statement checks if the result of the function is equal to the expected output. If it is, the test passes. If not, the test fails and an error is raised.
