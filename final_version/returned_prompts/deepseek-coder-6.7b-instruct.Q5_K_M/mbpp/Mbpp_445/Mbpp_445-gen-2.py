Explanation:

The function takes as input a tuple containing two tuples. It then iterates through each element in the first tuple. For each element, it multiplies the corresponding elements in the second tuple. The result is a new tuple where each element is a tuple of multiplied elements. 

"""
The function is written in such a way that it can handle nested tuples of arbitrary depth. This is achieved by recursively applying the map function to each element of the tuples.

The lambda function takes two arguments, x and y, and multiplies them together. The map function applies this lambda function to each element of the tuples. The result of this operation is a new tuple where each element is the result of the multiplication of the corresponding elements in the input tuples.

The map function is then used to apply this operation to each element of the tuples. The result of this operation is a new tuple where each element is the result of the multiplication of the corresponding elements in the input tuples. This new tuple is then returned as the result of the function.
