Explanation:
A number is a lucid number if it is 2 to the power of some integer.
In the given problem, we are asked to find all lucid numbers less than or equal to the given integer.
We use a for loop to iterate through each number from 1 to n. For each number, we check if it is a lucid number by using the bitwise AND operator with the number minus 1. If the result is not zero, then the number is not a lucid number. If it is zero, then the number is a lucid number and we append it to the list of lucid numbers.
Finally, we return the list of lucid numbers.
