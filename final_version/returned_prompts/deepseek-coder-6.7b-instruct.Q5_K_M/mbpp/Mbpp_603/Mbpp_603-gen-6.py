"""
This problem can be solved using Python.

The steps to solve this problem are:

1. Define a function that will take an integer as input.
2. Initialize an empty list to store the lucid numbers.
3. Iterate through all integers from 1 to the given integer.
4. For each integer, check if it is a lucid number by following these rules:
    4.1. A number is a lucid number if it is prime or if it can be written as the sum of two distinct prime numbers.
    4.2. If a number is prime, then it is a lucid number.
    4.3. If a number cannot be written as the sum of two distinct prime numbers, then it is not a lucid number.
5. If a number is a lucid number, add it to the list.
6. Return the list of lucid numbers.
