"""
A Lucas number is a sequence of integers that start with 2 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two previous ones (2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76, 123, â€¦).
In this case, we can solve the problem by generating the Lucas sequence up to the given number and returning the numbers that are less than or equal to the given number.

# Explanation:
"""
In the function get_lucas, we start by initializing a list 'lucas' with the first two Lucas numbers 2 and 1. We then enter a while loop that continues until the largest number in the 'lucas' list is greater than the input integer 'n'. In the loop, we append the sum of the last two numbers in the 'lucas' list to 'lucas'.
Finally, we return a list comprehension that includes each number in 'lucas' that is less than or equal to 'n'.

# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(n)

# This function generates all Lucas numbers less than or equal to 'n' and returns them in a list.
# It uses a while loop to generate the sequence and a list comprehension to filter the numbers.
# The time complexity of this function is O(n), as it generates a sequence of Lucas numbers up to 'n' and then filters that sequence.
# The space complexity is O(n), as it stores all Lucas numbers up to 'n' in the list 'lucas'.
# The function runs successfully and passes the test case in the question.

# Further improvements can be made by using generator instead of list to store the sequence. It will save memory when handling large inputs.
# The time complexity remains same but space complexity reduces to
