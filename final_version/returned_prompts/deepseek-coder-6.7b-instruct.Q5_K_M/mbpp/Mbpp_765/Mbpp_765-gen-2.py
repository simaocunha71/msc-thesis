# Solution:
# The polite numbers are the numbers which can be represented as sum of two or more consecutive numbers.
# We will use the concept of bitwise operation to solve this problem.
# For example, 5 is a polite number, because it can be expressed as 5 = 2 + 3.
# Now, let's see the code for the above problem.
# Here, we will use a function is_power_of_two to check if a number is a power of two or not.
# Then, we will use a while loop to find the nth polite number.
# The loop will continue until n becomes zero. In each iteration, it will check if the current number is a power of two.
# If it is, it will double the current number and continue to the next iteration.
# If it is not, it will decrease n by 1 and add 1 to the current number.
# Finally, it will return the current number divided by 2 as the nth polite number.
# The function is_polite will return the nth polite number.
# The time complexity of the function is_polite is O(log n), because in each iteration, it checks if the current number is a power of two or not.
# The space complexity of the function is_polite is O(1), because it uses only a constant amount of space.
