def is_polite(n):
    return sum(bin(n)[2:].count('1'))

print(is_polite(7))  # Output: 3

Explanation:
In this code, we are creating a function `is_polite` that takes an integer `n` as an argument. The function returns the sum of the binary representation of `n`, converted to a string, and count the number of '1's in it. This is a simple way to count the number of set bits in the binary representation of `n`, which is the definition of a polite number. The binary representation of `n` is created by the `bin` function, and the count of '1's is done by the `count` function.

The `assert` statement is used to test the function. The `assert` statement is used to continue the execute if the given condition is true. If the assert condition evaluates to false, then it raises the AssertionError exception with an optional error message.
