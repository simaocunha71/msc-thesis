```

The function `check_occurences` takes in a list of tuples and initializes an empty dictionary. It then iterates over the list, checking if each tuple is already in the dictionary. If it is, it increments the count by 1; if not, it adds the tuple to the dictionary with a count of 1. Finally, it returns the dictionary.

# Explanation:
The function works by creating an empty dictionary. Then it iterates over the input list of tuples. For each tuple, it checks if the tuple is already in the dictionary. If it is, it increments the count of that tuple by 1. If it is not in the dictionary, it adds the tuple to the dictionary with a count of 1. Finally, it returns the dictionary.

The assertion in the question is incorrect because the tuples are not in the correct format for the dictionary. The correct format would be: {(1, 3
