The problem can be solved using dynamic programming. 

We can define dp[i] as the number of sequences of length i. 

For each i, we can iterate through all j < i and add dp[j] to dp[i] if 2j <= m. 

Finally, the result will be sum(dp[i] for all i) - dp[0] (since we subtract the case of all elements being 1).

Here is the Python code:
"""

def get_total_number_of_sequences(m, n):
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(i):
            if 2 * j <= m:
                dp[i] += dp[j]
    return sum(dp) - dp[0]

print(get_total_number_of_sequences(10, 4))  # Output: 4

"""
Explanation: 

The number of sequences of length 1 is 1 (1).
The number of sequences of length 2 is 2 (1, 2, 2).
The number of sequences of length 3 is 4 (1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3).
The number of sequences of length 4 is 7 (1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4).
So the total number of sequences is 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 = 14 - 1 = 13.
