Here is the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
import math

def volume_cone(radius, height):
    return (1/3) * math.pi * radius**2 * height
```

In this code, the function `volume_cone(radius, height)` takes two arguments: radius and height. It returns the volume of the cone as per the formula `(1/3) * Ï€ * r^2 * h`.

The `math.isclose()` function is used to check the accuracy of the result. It takes three arguments: the numbers to be compared, and a relative tolerance. If the absolute difference between the numbers is less than the relative tolerance, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Here, we set the relative tolerance to `0.001`.

Now, if you run the function with the given parameters, it should return the correct volume.
"""
assert math.isclose(volume_cone(5,12), 314.15926535897927, rel_tol=0.001)
"""

The output will be:

```
True
```

This means that the function is working correctly.
