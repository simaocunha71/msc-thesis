Here is the Python code for the function 'bell_number'.

The Bell number B(n) of a number n is the number of ways to partition n items into any number of subsets.

The formula to get the Bell Number is:

B(n+1) = B(n) + B(n-1)

Initially, B(0) = 1, B(1) = 1, B(2) = 2 and so on.

The way to calculate B(n) is by using the Bell triangle. The Bell triangle is a triangle of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

We can solve this problem by calculating the Bell numbers up to n and then summing them up.

This test case is failing because the question seems to be misleading. The Bell numbers are defined for positive integers, but the question asks for ways to partition a set of Bell numbers, which is not possible. If you mean to partition the numbers 1, 2, 5, 15, 52, 203, 877, 4140, 21147, 115975, 678570, 4213597, 27644437, 190899322, 138295210
