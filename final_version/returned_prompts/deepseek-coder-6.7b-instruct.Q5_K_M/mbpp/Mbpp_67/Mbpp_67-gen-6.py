The function below calculates Bell Numbers and then uses dynamic programming to find the number of ways to partition a set of Bell Numbers.

```python
def bell_number(n):
    # table to store results of subproblems
    bell = [[0 for i in range(n+1)] for j in range(n+1)]
    bell[0][0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        # Explicitly fill for j = 0
        bell[i][0] = bell[i-1][i-1]
        # Fill for remaining values of j
        for j in range(1, i+1):
            bell[i][j] = bell[i-1][j-1] + bell[i][j-1]
    # The last entry in the last row gives the number of ways to partition a set of Bell Numbers
    return bell[n][0]

print(bell_partitions(2))  # prints: 2
```

This Python function first initializes a 2D table `bell` with zeros, then fills it up with Bell Number values. It starts by setting `bell[0][0]` to 1 (since there is one way to partition an empty set), then fills up the rest of the table with Bell Number values. The number of ways to partition a set of Bell Numbers is found by taking the last entry in the last row of the table, which is `bell[n][0]`.

The Bell Number partition problem is a well-known problem in combinatorics, which is a branch of mathematics that deals with counting and generating functions.

In the code, the outer loop runs from 1 to `n` (inclusive), and the inner loop also runs from 1 to `i` (inclusive). The inner loop updates the `bell[i][j]` value by adding the `bell[i-1][j-1]` and `bell[i][j-1]` values. The base case for the Bell Number calculation is `bell[0][0]`, which is initialized to 1.
