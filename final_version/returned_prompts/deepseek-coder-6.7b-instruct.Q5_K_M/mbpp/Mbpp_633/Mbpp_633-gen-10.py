print(pair_xor_Sum([5,9,7,6],4))

Explanation:
The function pair_xor_Sum takes a list of numbers and the number of elements in the list as arguments. It calculates the xor of all pairs of numbers in the list, and then returns the sum of these xor results.

The inner loop starts at i + 1 because we don't want to consider the same pair of numbers twice.

The outer loop iterates over all possible pairs of numbers in the list.

The xor of two numbers is calculated using the ^ operator in Python.

The result is doubled because for each pair (i, j), we also count the pair (j, i), which is the same and we want to avoid counting it twice.

The function is then called with the list [5,9,7,6] and 4 as arguments, and the result is printed.

The expected result is 47, which is the sum of the xor of all pairs of numbers in the list.

"""
This is the correct solution to the problem. It works by iterating over all pairs of numbers in the list and calculating their xor using the ^ operator. The result is then doubled to account for pairs where the order of the numbers is reversed (i.e., (j, i) is the same as (i, j)). The function returns the sum of all these xor results.
