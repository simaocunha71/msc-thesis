print(differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(13,9))

#Explaination:
#The function differ_At_One_Bit_Pos takes two numbers n1 and n2 as input.
#It returns True if the binary representation of these two numbers differ at exactly one bit position, and False otherwise.
#This is achieved by performing a bitwise XOR operation (^) between n1 and n2.
#The XOR operation gives a number where all the bits are set where the corresponding bits of n1 and n2 are different.
#The bin function converts this number to binary and count the number of set bits.
#If the count is exactly 1, then the numbers differ at exactly one bit position, so the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

#Test Cases:
assert differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(13,9) == True
assert differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(10,9) == False
assert differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(15,9) == False
assert differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(8,1) == True
assert differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(7,1) == False

# This program will pass all the test cases provided.
