Your code has a number of issues:

You are using the C-style scanf to read strings. This is error-prone and can lead to buffer overflow. Instead, use the C++-style getline function from the istream class.
You are using a nested loop to compare characters of the two strings. This is inefficient and can be replaced with a more direct comparison.
Your code does not handle the case where the second string is longer than the first string.
Your code does not handle the case where the second string is an empty string.
Your code does not handle the case where the second string is a rotation of the first string.
Your code does not handle the case where the second string is a substring of the first string, but not a rotation.

Here is a revised version of your code that addresses these issues:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

bool cycpattern_check(const std::string& a, const std::string& b) {
    if (b.empty()) {
        return false;
    }
    if (a.size() < b.size()) {
        return false;
    }

    std::string rotated = b + b;
    if (rotated.find(a) != std::string::npos) {
        return true;
    }

    return false;
}

int main() {
    std::string a, b;
    while (std::cin >> a >> b) {
        std::cout << "cycpattern_check(" << a << ", " << b << ") => " << std::boolalpha << cycpattern_check(a, b) << std::endl;
    }
    return
