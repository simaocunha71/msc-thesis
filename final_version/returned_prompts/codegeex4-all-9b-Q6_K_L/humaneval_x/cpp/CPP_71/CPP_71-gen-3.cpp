The code you provided is correct for calculating the area of a triangle given the lengths of its three sides. However, there are a few improvements that can be made to make the code more efficient and readable.

1. The `triangle_area` function can be simplified by removing the `if` statement that checks if the three sides form a valid triangle. This check can be done in the `main` function before calling the `triangle_area` function.

2. The `triangle_area` function can be modified to return a `double` instead of a `float` to improve precision.

3. The `triangle_area` function can be modified to use the `pow` function instead of the `sqrt` function to calculate the square root.

4. The `triangle_area` function can be modified to use the `round` function instead of multiplying by 100 and dividing by 100 to round to two decimal places.

Here is the modified code:

```c++
#include<stdio.h>
#include<math.h>
using namespace std;

double triangle_area(double a, double b, double c) {
    double s = (a + b + c) / 2;
    double area = pow(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c), 0.5);
    return round(area * 100) / 100;
}

int main() {
    double a, b, c;
    scanf("%lf%lf%lf", &a, &b, &c);
    if (a > 0 && b > 0 && c > 0) {
        printf("%lf", triangle_area(a, b, c));
    } else {
        printf("-1");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This code will calculate the area of a triangle given the lengths of its three sides and round the result to two
