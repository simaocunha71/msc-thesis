The `encode_cyclic` function takes a string as input and returns a new string where each group of three characters is cycled. The `decode_cyclic` function does the opposite, it takes the encoded string and returns the original string.

Here is a possible solution for the `decode_cyclic` function:

```c++
string decode_cyclic(string s){ 
    // returns decoded string by cycling groups of three characters in reverse order.  
    // split string to groups. Each of length 3.
    int l=s.length();
    int num=(l+2)/3;
    string x,output;
    int i;
    for (i=0;i*3<l;i++)
    {
        //cycle elements in each group in reverse order. Unless group has fewer elements than 3.
        x=s.substr(i*3,3);
        if (x.length()==3) x=x.substr(2)+x[0]+x[1];
        output=output+x;
    }
    return output;
}
```

This solution is based on the same logic as the `encode_cyclic` function, but it cycles the groups in reverse order.
