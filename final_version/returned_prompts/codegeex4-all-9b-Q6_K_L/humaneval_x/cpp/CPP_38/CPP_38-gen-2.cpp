The function `encode_cyclic` is designed to encode a string by cycling groups of three characters. The function `decode_cyclic` is designed to decode a string encoded with `encode_cyclic`. 

However, the `decode_cyclic` function is not correctly implemented. It does not correctly reverse the encoding process. Specifically, it does not correctly handle the case when the last group has fewer than three characters. 

Here is a corrected version of the `decode_cyclic` function:

```cpp
string decode_cyclic(string s){ 
    /*
    takes as input string encoded with encode_cyclic function. Returns decoded string. 
    */
    int l=s.length();
    int num=(l+2)/3;
    string x,output;
    int i;
    for (i=0;i*3<l;i++)
    {
        //cycle elements in each group. Unless group has fewer elements than 3.
        x=s.substr(i*3,3);
        if (x.length()==3) x=x[x.length()-1]+x.substr(0,x.length()-1);
        output=output+x;
    }
    return output;
}
```

In this corrected version, we move the last character of each group to the front when the group has three characters. This correctly reverses the encoding process.
