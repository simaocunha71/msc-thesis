The question is asking us to implement a function that calculates the n-th element of the Fib4 number sequence. The Fib4 sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but it is defined with an additional term. Specifically, the Fib4 sequence is defined as follows:

fib4(0) -> 0
fib4(1) -> 0
fib4(2) -> 2
fib4(3) -> 0
fib4(n) -> fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4)

The question asks us to implement this function without using recursion. Instead, we can use an iterative approach to calculate the n-th element of the Fib4 sequence.

Here is an iterative solution to the problem:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int fib4(int n) {
    if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
        return 0;
    } else if (n == 2) {
        return 2;
    } else if (n == 3) {
        return 0;
    } else {
        int a = 0;
        int b = 0;
        int c = 2;
        int d = 0;

        for (int i = 4; i <= n; i++) {
            int temp = a + b + c + d;
            a = b;
            b = c;
            c = d;
            d = temp;
        }

        return d;
    }
}

int main() {
    std::cout << fib4(5) << std::endl;  // Output: 4
    std::cout << fib4(6) << std::endl;  // Output: 8
    std::cout << fib4(7) << std::endl;  // Output: 14

    return 0;
}
```

In this solution, we use four variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` to store the last four elements of the Fib4 sequence. We initialize these variables based on the initial values of the sequence. Then, we iterate from 4 to `n` and calculate the next element of the sequence by adding up the last four elements. After each iteration, we update the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` to hold the last four elements of the sequence. Finally, we return the `d` variable, which holds the n
