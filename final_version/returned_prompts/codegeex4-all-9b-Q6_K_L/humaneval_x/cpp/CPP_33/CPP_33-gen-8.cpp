```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

vector<int> sort_third(vector<int> l) {
    vector<int> sorted_thirds;
    vector<int> non_thirds;

    // Separate the elements that are divisible by three and those that are not
    for (int i = 0; i < l.size(); ++i) {
        if (i % 3 == 0) {
            sorted_thirds.push_back(l[i]);
        } else {
            non_thirds.push_back(l[i]);
        }
    }

    // Sort the elements that are divisible by three
    sort(sorted_thirds.begin(), sorted_thirds.end());

    // Combine the elements back into the original order
    for (int i = 0; i < l.size(); ++i) {
        if (i % 3 == 0) {
            l[i] = sorted_thirds[i / 3];
        }
    }

    return l;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> result = sort_third({5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2});
    for (int num : result) {
        cout << num << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This solution separates the elements of the input vector `l` into two categories: those that are divisible by three (which need to be sorted) and those that are not. It then sorts the elements that are divisible by three and replaces them in the original vector while keeping the other elements in their original positions. The function returns the modified vector.
