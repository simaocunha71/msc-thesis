```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

vector<int> compare(vector<int> game, vector<int> guess) {
    vector<int> result;
    for (int i = 0; i < game.size(); i++) {
        result.push_back(abs(game[i] - guess[i]));
    }
    return result;
}
```

I have made a small modification to the function. I have added `#include <cmath>` to include the `abs` function and `using namespace std;` to avoid prefixing standard library functions and types with `std::`. The function remains the same as the reference solution, but it now correctly includes the necessary headers and uses the standard namespace.
