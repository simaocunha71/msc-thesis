The correct solution is option G.

This is because the problem states that the function should return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13. The function should not consider integers divisible by 7, as the problem does not mention anything about considering integers divisible by 7. So, the correct condition to check is if the integer is divisible by either 11 or 13.

The provided code in option G correctly implements this condition and returns the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.

The other options (A, B, C, D, E, F) are incorrect because they either check for divisibility
