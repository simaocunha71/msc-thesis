/*
Task
We are given two strings s and c, you have to deleted all the characters in s that are equal to any character in c
then check if the result string is palindrome.
A string is called palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward.
You should return a vector containing the result string and "True"/"False" for the check.
Example
For s = "abcde", c = "ae", the result should be ("bcd","False")
For s = "abcdef", c = "b"  the result should be ("acdef","False")
For s = "abcdedcba", c = "ab", the result should be ("cdedc","True")
