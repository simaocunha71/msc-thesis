The code you provided is a C++ program that checks if a given string is a palindrome and finds the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string. 

The function `is_palindrome` checks if a string is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse. If they are the same, then the string is a palindrome. 

The function `make_palindrome` finds the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string. It does this by finding the longest postfix of the supplied string that is a palindrome and then appending to the end of the string the reverse of the string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix. 

The main problem with this code is that it does not handle the case where the supplied string is already a palindrome. In this case, the function will append the reverse of the string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix, which is unnecessary. 

To fix this, you can add a condition to check if the supplied string is already a palindrome. If it is, then you can simply return the string. Here is the modified code: 

```c++
#include<stdio.h>
#include<string>
using namespace std;
bool is_palindrome(string str){
    //Test if given string is a palindrome 
    string s(str.rbegin(),str.rend());
    return s==str;
}
string make_palindrome(string str){
    /*
    Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string. 
    Algorithm idea is simple: - Find the longest postfix of supplied string that is a palindrome. 
    - Append to the end of the string reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.
    >>> make_palindrome("") 
    "" 
    >>> make_palindrome("cat") 
    "catac" 
    >>> make_palindrome("cata") 
    "catac" 
    */
    if(is_palindrome(str)) return str;
    string s(str.rbegin(),str.rend());
    string prefix="";
    for(int i=0;i<str.size();i++){
        if(is_palindrome(str.substr(i,str.size()-i))){
            prefix=str.substr(0,i);
            break;
        }
    }
    return str+s+prefix;
}
```

In this modified code, the function `make_palindrome` checks if the supplied string is already a palindrome. If it is, then it simply returns the string. Otherwise, it finds the longest postfix of the supplied string that is a palindrome and then appends to the end of the string the reverse of the
