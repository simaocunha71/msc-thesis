The function is_palindrome checks whether a string is a palindrome by reversing it and comparing it to the original string. The function make_palindrome finds the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string by finding the longest postfix of the supplied string that is a palindrome and appending to the end of the string the reverse of the prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.

The function is_palindrome is correct because it correctly reverses the string and compares it to the original string.

The function make_palindrome is correct because it correctly finds the longest postfix of the supplied string that is a palindrome and appends to the end of the string the reverse of the prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.

The function make_palindrome is also correct because it correctly handles cases where the supplied string is already a palindrome, and cases where the supplied string is not a palindrome.

The time complexity of the function make_palindrome is O(n), where n is the length of the supplied string. This is because the function makes a single pass through the supplied string to find the longest postfix that is a palindrome, and then makes a single pass through the prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix to reverse it.
