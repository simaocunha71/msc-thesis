    willItFly(Arrays.asList(1, 2), 5) -> false

    willItFly(Arrays.asList(3, 2, 3), 1) -> false
    # it's balanced, but 3+2+3 is more than the maximum possible weight.

    willItFly(Arrays.asList(3, 2, 3), 9) -> true
    # 3+2+3 is less than the maximum possible weight, and it's balanced.

    willItFly(Arrays.asList(3), 5) -> true
    # 3 is less than the maximum possible weight, and it's balanced.
