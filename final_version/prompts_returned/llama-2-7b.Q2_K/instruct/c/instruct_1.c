Write a C function that loads a resource bundle from a file and returns the number of items in the bundle, using standard library functions. The function should take a path to the resource file as input and return the number of items as output. The function should allocate memory for the bundle and its items using dynamic memory allocation. The function should also check for errors and return an error code if necessary.

    Only return the code, don't include any other information,
    such as a preamble or suffix.
