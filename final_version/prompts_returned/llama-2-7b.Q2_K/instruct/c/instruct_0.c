Write a function in C that creates a new state list by finding a list of states in a given finite state automaton (FSA) and stores the resulting state list in a dynamic memory allocation. The function should accept a pointer to an integer array representing the states, an integer representing the number of states, a pointer to an FSA, and an integer representing the last state in the list. The function should return a pointer to the newly created state list, or NULL if there is insufficient memory. The function should also update the 'next' pointer of the last state in the list to point to the newly created state list.

    Only return the code, don't include any other information,
    such as a preamble or suffix.
