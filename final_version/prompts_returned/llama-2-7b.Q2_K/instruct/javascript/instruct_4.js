Write a JavaScript function that loads a module from a file and returns its exported function. The function should take a filename and options object as arguments, and use the fs module to read the file synchronously. The function should also check if the module has been loaded before and return the cached module if so. The function should throw an error if the module cannot be loaded.

    Only return the code, don't include any other information,
    such as a preamble or suffix.
