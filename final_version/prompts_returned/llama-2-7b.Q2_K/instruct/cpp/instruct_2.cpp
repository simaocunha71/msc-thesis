Write a C function that takes a filename as input and modifies its extension to include a number of digits and a file type. The function should use the sprintf and strcat functions to create the new file name. The number of digits and file type should be determined by examining the characters of the original filename.

    Only return the code, don't include any other information,
    such as a preamble or suffix.
