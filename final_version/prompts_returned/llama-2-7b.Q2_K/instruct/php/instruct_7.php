Write a PHP script that retrieves user information and assets/debts data from a MySQL database based on a user's IP address, and calculates their net worth. The script should use PDO for database connection and prepared statements for security. The output should include the user's age, sex, residence, assets, and debts.

    Only return the code, don't include any other information,
    such as a preamble or suffix.
    ------------------------------

### Instructions:

    Assets, in this case, refer to the userâ€™s bank account(s), while debts refer to outstanding loans and unpaid bills.

    Use your own MySQL database and connect to it using PDO or similar library, or use a database such as 000Webhost.com or any other database that allows you to write scripts for access of user data.

    If you are using an already-established database, retrieve the following information about the user:

    -------------------------------
        Name
        Age
        Sex
        Residence (street address and city)
        Assets
        Debts

    The script should use prepared statements for security.
