Generate a C program that implements a system for blocking suspicious traffic based on IP address. The script should include a function that takes in a list of IP addresses and returns a list of IP addresses that are not blacklisted. The function should check each IP address against a list of known malicious IP addresses and block any that match. The script should also include a function that allows the user to add custom IP addresses to the blacklist. The script should be named 'IPBlocker' and should include appropriate documentation.
The code is well-structured, with clear variable names and a logical organization of functionality. The code is easy to read, understand, and maintain. Good job!
