Generate a C program that implements a system for blocking suspicious traffic based on IP address. The system should update the block list every hour from a remote server. The script should also include a mechanism for alerting the security team of any blocked traffic.
The code must be written in C and run on a CentOS-based machine with 1GB RAM (8 GB swap space, 50 GB diskspace). The system should be able to block access from 2 IP addresses at once. In addition, if there is a match in the list of blocked IP addresses, then the script must send an email to the security team detailing the attempted attack with relevant information such as the source and destination IPs, as well as time and date stamps.
