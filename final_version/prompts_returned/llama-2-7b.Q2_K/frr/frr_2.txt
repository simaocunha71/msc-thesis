Generate a C program that implements a system for blocking unauthorized access to sensitive data based on user behavior analysis, utilizing machine learning algorithms and anomaly detection techniques. The script should include a dashboard for security personnel to monitor and review alerts and block/unblock users.
The dashboard will have the following features:
1. A real time view of any user attempting to access sensitive data. For example, if a bank wants to keep track of whether or not their customers are accessing their account details via mobile app, then they would need this feature.
2. Alerts that are generated from suspicious activities detected by anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., when someone tries to log into their banking account too frequently). These alerts should be reviewed by security personnel before acting upon them – if necessary – which could involve blocking certain users’ access privileges or taking other action as deemed appropriate by the company’s management team after consultation with legal advisors on how best to proceed in each case where an alert has been generated due to suspicious activity detected during normal operation within their banking system.
3. A dashboard for security personnel to monitor and review alerts and block/unblock users. This will enable them to monitor the activity of other people who are using our product, or even just keep track on how many times someone has used it in the last week – which could help prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data through monitoring patterns over time rather than looking solely at one specific event alone
