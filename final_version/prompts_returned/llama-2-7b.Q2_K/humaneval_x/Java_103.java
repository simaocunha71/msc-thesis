    You are given two positive integers n and m, and your task is to compute the
    average of the integers from n through m (including n and m).
    Round the answer to the nearest integer and convert that to binary.
    If n is greater than m, return -1.
    Example:
    roundedAvg(1, 5) => "11"
    roundedAvg(7, 5) => -1
    roundedAvg(10, 20) => "1111"
    roundedAvg(20, 33) => "11011"
