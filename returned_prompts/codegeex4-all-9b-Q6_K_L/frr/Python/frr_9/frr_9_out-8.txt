 The script should be modular, with separate functions for reading IP addresses, calculating risk scores, updating the risk assessment model, and blocking IP addresses. Additionally, the script should be able to handle both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
Here's an example of a Python script that implements a system for blocking suspicious IP addresses based on a customized risk assessment model:
```python
import re
import socket
from firewall import Firewall

def read_ip_addresses(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        ip_addresses = file.readlines()
    return [ip.strip() for ip in ip_addresses]

def calculate_risk_score(ip_address):
    # Implement your customized risk assessment algorithm here
    # For example, you can check if the IP address is in a known malicious list
    # or calculate the number of requests from that IP address in a given time frame
    # Return a risk score as a float between 0 and 1
    return 0.0

def update_risk_assessment_model(threat_intelligence_data):
    # Implement your mechanism for updating the risk assessment model based on new threat intelligence data
    # For example, you can update a list of known malicious IP addresses or adjust the risk scoring algorithm
    pass

def block_ip_addresses(ip_addresses, threshold):
    firewall = Firewall()
    for ip in ip_addresses:
        if calculate_risk_score(ip) > threshold:
            firewall.block_ip(ip)

def main():
    ip_addresses = read_ip_addresses('ip_addresses.txt')
    threshold = 0.5  # Set your desired threshold for blocking IP addresses
    block_ip_addresses(ip_addresses, threshold)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
In this example, the `read_ip_addresses` function reads IP addresses from a text file and returns them as a list. The `calculate_risk_score` function is where you implement your customized risk assessment algorithm. The `update_risk_assessment_model` function is where you implement your mechanism for updating the risk assessment model based on new threat intelligence data. The `block_ip_addresses` function uses a firewall to block IP addresses with a risk score above the threshold. Finally, the `main` function reads IP addresses from the file, sets the threshold, and calls the `block_ip_addresses` function to block suspicious IP addresses.
Note that the `firewall` module is just a placeholder for the actual firewall implementation you would use. You would need to replace it with the appropriate firewall module or library for
