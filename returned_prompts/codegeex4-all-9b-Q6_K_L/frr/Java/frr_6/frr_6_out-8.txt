Generate a Java program that implements a mechanism to rotate the encryption key used for secure communication in a web application every 24 hours. The script should use a secure random number generator to generate a new key and store it in a secure location. The script should also include a function to retrieve the current key and use it to encrypt and decrypt messages. The function should be able to handle both encryption and decryption operations. The script should be designed to be easily integrated into a larger web application and should include appropriate error handling and logging mechanisms.
