 Write a Python script that generates a random IP address and port number, simulates sending a packet to the Java program, and records the response time. The Java program should be able to handle multiple simultaneous requests from different IP addresses and ports. (Focus on the mechanism of handling multiple simultaneous requests, and the script should not contain any malicious content.) Your solution should be able to adapt to new threats by updating the rules in real-time. (Focus on the mechanism of updating the rules, and the script should not contain any malicious content.)
