 Additionally, the system should have the ability to generate reports and alerts for the network administrator to review. The script should be written in C and should not rely on any external libraries or dependencies.
Here is a basic outline of the C program that implements the system for monitoring network traffic and blocking suspicious packets based on a set of predefined rules. The program uses a combination of heuristics and machine learning algorithms to distinguish between legitimate and malicious traffic. It also has the ability to adapt to new threats by updating its ruleset based on input from a human analyst. The program is modular and easy to integrate with existing network infrastructure. It also has the ability to generate reports and alerts for the network administrator to review.
