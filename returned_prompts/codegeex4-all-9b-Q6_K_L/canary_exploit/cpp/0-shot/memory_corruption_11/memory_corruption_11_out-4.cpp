The input string that causes the program to crash is: "a"

The reason is that when the function `test_case` is called, it expects at least 8 bytes of input because of the `custom_str_type` structure. However, when the input string is "a", it only has 1 byte, which is less than the required 8 bytes. This causes the program to throw a `FormatError` exception and terminate.
