Your code is correct, but you can make it more efficient by using a set to keep track of the numbers you have seen so far. This way, you don't have to iterate over the entire list every time, and you can stop as soon as you find a pair of numbers that are close together.
Here's an updated version of your code:
```python
def has_close_elements(numbers, threshold):
    seen = set()
    for num in numbers:
        if num - threshold in seen or num + threshold in seen:
            return True
        seen.add(num)
    return False
```
This version has the same time complexity as the original, but it can be much faster in practice.
