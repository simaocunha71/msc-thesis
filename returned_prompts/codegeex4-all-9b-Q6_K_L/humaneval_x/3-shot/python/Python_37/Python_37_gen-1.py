Your first function is correct. It goes through each pair of elements, and checks if the absolute difference is less than the threshold. If it is, it returns True. If it goes through all pairs without finding a close pair, it returns False.
Your second function is incorrect. It goes through each character in the string, and increments the depth when it sees an open parenthesis, and decrements it when it sees a close parenthesis. However, it does not check if the depth ever goes negative (which would mean that there are more close parentheses than open ones). Also, it does not check if the depth ever goes back to zero (which would mean that a group of parentheses has been closed). Finally, it does not add the current group to the result list until the depth goes back to zero. This means that if the string ends with an open parenthesis, the last group will not be added to the result list.
Here is a corrected version of the second function:
def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    result = []
    current_string = []
    depth = 0

    for c in paren_string:
        if c == '(':
            depth += 1
            current_string.append(c)
        elif c == ')':
            depth -= 1
            current_string.append(c)

            if depth == 0:
                result.append(''.join(current_string))
                current_string = []

    return result

Your third function is correct. It uses the modulus operator to find the decimal part of the number.
Your fourth function is incorrect. It sorts the list of even-indexed values, but then replaces the even-indexed values of the original list with the sorted values. This means that the original list is modified, which is not what the function description says. Instead, you should create a new list that is identical to the original list, but with the even-indexed values sorted.
Here is a corrected version of the fourth function:
def sort_even(l: list) -> list:
    even_indices = sorted([l[i] for i in range(0, len(l), 2)])
    result = l[:]
    for i, val in enumerate(even_indices):
        result[i*2] = val

    return result
