I have reviewed your code and I have some comments for each one.
The first question is about finding if two elements in a list are closer than a given threshold. The code you have is fine and it is a simple solution. But I would say that the comments are not good enough, you should explain better what the code is doing and what it is expected from the function.
The second question is about separating groups of parentheses in a string. The code you have is fine and it is a simple solution. But I would say that the comments are not good enough, you should explain better what the code is doing and what it is expected from the function.
The third question is about truncating a floating point number. The code you have is fine and it is a simple solution. But I would say that the comments are not good enough, you should explain better what the code is doing and what it is expected from the function.
The fourth question is about checking if a number is a cube of some integer number. The code you have is fine and it is a simple solution. But I would say that the comments are not good enough, you should explain better what the code is doing and what it is expected from the function.
