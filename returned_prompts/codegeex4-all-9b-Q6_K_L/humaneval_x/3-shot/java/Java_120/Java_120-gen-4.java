The first problem is pretty straightforward. You need to loop through the list of numbers and check if the difference between any two numbers is less than the threshold.
The second problem is about parsing a string of parentheses and separating them into different groups. You need to keep track of the current depth of parentheses and add each parentheses to the current group when the depth is 0.
The third problem is about getting the decimal part of a number. You can use the modulus operator (%) to get the decimal part of a number.
The fourth problem is about finding the k maximum numbers in an array. You can use a selection algorithm to find the kth largest number and then use it to partition the array into two parts. The part larger than the kth largest number is the result.
