The code is generally good. However, there are some improvements that could be made.

hasCloseElements(): 
The code works correctly, but it could be more efficient. Currently, the inner loop starts at i+1, which means that it checks every pair of numbers twice. This could be improved by starting the inner loop at i+1, which would check each pair only once. This would reduce the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n(log(n))).

separateParenGroups():
The code works correctly, but it could be more efficient. Currently, it uses a StringBuilder to build the current string, which is then added to the result list. This could be improved by using a StringBuilder directly in the result list, which would avoid the need to copy the string.

truncateNumber():
The code works correctly, but it could be more efficient. Currently, it uses the modulus operator to truncate the number. This could be improved by using the Math.floor() method, which would be more efficient and would not require the conversion to a double.

maximum():
The code works correctly, but it could be more efficient. Currently, it uses a PriorityQueue to find the maximum k numbers. This could be improved by using a sorting algorithm, such as quicksort or mergesort, to sort the array and then take the last k elements. This would be more efficient and would not require the use of a PriorityQueue.
