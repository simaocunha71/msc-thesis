I would like to start with the fact that your code is very good, you have a good understanding of the language and you have used all the tools that are available in Java.
However, I would like to point out some improvements that can be made to your code:

1. The first problem is that you are not using the correct data types for your variables. In the first problem, you are using a List of Doubles, but you are comparing them to a double. This is a problem because you are comparing an object to a primitive data type, which can lead to unexpected results.
2. The second problem is that you are not using the correct data types for your variables. In the second problem, you are using a StringBuilder to store the current string, but you are appending characters to it as if it were a String. This is a problem because you are not using the StringBuilder correctly, and it can lead to unexpected results.
3. The third problem is that you are not using the correct data types for your variables. In the third problem, you are using a List of Strings, but you are comparing them to a String. This is a problem because you are comparing an object to a primitive data type, which can lead to unexpected results.
4. The fourth problem is that you are not using the correct data types for your variables. In the fourth problem, you are using a List of Strings, but you are comparing them to a String. This is a problem because you are comparing an object to a primitive data type, which can lead to unexpected results.
5. The fifth problem is that you are not using the correct data types for your variables. In the fifth problem, you are using a List of Strings, but you are comparing them to a String. This is a problem because you are comparing an object to a primitive data type, which can lead to unexpected results.
