I will use the first question to show you a good way to solve these problems. The other questions are similar to each other in that they're asking you to do something with lists or arrays. 

What is the problem asking for?
In this case, we have a list of doubles and a threshold. We need to check if any two elements in the list are closer than the threshold.
What tools do I have to solve the problem?
We have a list of doubles and we can iterate over it. We can also use the Math.abs() function to find the absolute value of a number. Lastly, we have the if-else statement that will allow us to check if two numbers are closer than the threshold.
How will I use these tools to solve the problem?
We will iterate over the list and for each element, we will check if it is closer than the threshold to any other element. If it is, we will return true. If we finish the loop without finding any two numbers closer than the threshold, we will return false.
What do I need to do to get the code to match the requirements?
We need to make sure that we return true when we find two numbers closer than the threshold and false when we don't. We also need to make sure that we don't compare a number to itself. 

Here is the corrected code:

import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    /**
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.
    >>> hasCloseElements(Arrays.asList(1.0, 2.0, 3.0), 0.5)
    false
    >>> hasCloseElements(Arrays.asList(1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0), 0.3)
    true
     */
    public boolean hasCloseElements(List<Double> numbers, double threshold) {
        for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++) {
            for (int j =
