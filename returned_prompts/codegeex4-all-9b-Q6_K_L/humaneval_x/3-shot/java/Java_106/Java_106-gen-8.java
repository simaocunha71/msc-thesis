1. hasCloseElements
Your algorithm is not efficient. If you have a list of numbers in a sorted order, the problem is trivial: just compare each adjacent pair of numbers. The worst case scenario for your current implementation is O(n^2) (when the list is not sorted), and for a sorted list it's O(n). You can improve the worst case scenario by sorting the list first (O(n log n) time complexity).
2. separateParenGroups
Your algorithm is correct, but it can be optimized. You can avoid using StringBuilder and just use the StringBuilder.append() method directly. This will make the code more concise and readable. Also, you can use String.replace() to remove all spaces from the input string, instead of using a for loop and checking each character.
3. truncateNumber
Your implementation is correct, but it can be simplified. You can use the Math.floor() method to get the integer part of the number, and then subtract it from the original number to get the decimal part.
4. f
Your implementation is correct, but it can be optimized. You can use a switch statement instead of if-else to determine whether to calculate the factorial or the sum. This will make the code more concise and readable. Also, you can use a for loop to calculate the factorial and the sum in a single loop, instead of using two separate loops.
