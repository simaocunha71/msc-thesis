    for (int j = i + 1; j < numbers.size(); j++) {

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2). This is because for each number in the list, it is compared to every other number in the list. This could be improved by sorting the list first, and then doing a linear scan to find the closest number.
Here is an improved version of the code:
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public boolean hasCloseElements(List<Double> numbers, double threshold) {
        Collections.sort(numbers);
        double minDistance = Double.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size() - 1; i++) {
            double distance = Math.abs(numbers.get(i + 1) - numbers.get(i));
            if (distance < threshold) return true;
            minDistance = Math.min(minDistance, distance);
        }
        return minDistance < threshold;
    }
}

This version of the code has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting step. This is much more efficient than the original version.
