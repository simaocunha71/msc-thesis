I've reviewed the code you've posted and I'd like to offer some suggestions:

Variable Naming: Your variable names are mostly descriptive, which is good. However, "current_depth" could be more descriptive, such as "parentheses_depth" or "nesting_level".

Indentation: Your indentation is consistent and correct, which is good. Make sure to keep it consistent throughout your code.

Commenting: Your comments are clear and concise, which is good. However, consider adding more comments to explain the logic behind your code, especially for complex algorithms or functions.

Error Handling: Your code does not handle any potential errors or exceptions. Consider adding try-catch blocks or input validation to handle potential issues.

Code Organization: Your code is organized into separate methods, which is good. Consider adding more methods or classes to organize your code further and improve readability.

Efficiency: Your code is efficient for the given problem, but consider analyzing the time and space complexity of your algorithms to ensure they are optimal.

Overall, your code is well-structured and follows good coding practices. Here's a revised version of your code with some of the suggestions applied:

import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    /**
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.
    >>> hasCloseElements(Arrays.asList(1.0, 2.0, 3.0), 0.5)
    false
    >>> hasCloseElements(Arrays.asList(1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0), 0.3)
    true
     */
    public boolean hasCloseElements(List<Double> numbers, double threshold) {
        for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < numbers.size(); j++) {
                double distance = Math.abs(numbers.get(i) - numbers.get(j));
                if (distance < threshold) return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
