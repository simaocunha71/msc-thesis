1. For the first question, the code works fine, but it can be optimized for better performance. We can use a TreeSet instead of a List to store the numbers and find the minimum and maximum numbers in O(1) time complexity. The rest of the code will remain the same. Here is the updated code:
```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    public boolean hasCloseElements(List<Double> numbers, double threshold) {
        TreeSet<Double> set = new TreeSet<>(numbers);
        double min = set.first();
        double max = set.last();
        return max - min < threshold;
    }
}
```
2. For the second question, the code is correct and works as expected. It separates the groups of parentheses into separate strings by keeping track of the current depth of parentheses and adding them to the current string. When the depth becomes zero, it adds the current string to the result list and resets the current string. The time complexity of the code is O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
3. For the third question, the code is correct and works as expected. It returns the decimal part of the number by subtracting the integer part from the number. The time complexity of the code is O(1).
4. For the fourth question, the code is correct and works as expected. It encrypts the input string by rotating the alphabet in a manner such that the letters shift down by two multiplied to two places. The time complexity of the code is O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
