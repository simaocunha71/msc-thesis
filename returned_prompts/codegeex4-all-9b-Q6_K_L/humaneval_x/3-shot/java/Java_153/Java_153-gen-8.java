The problem with the truncateNumber method is that it only works with floating point numbers that have a value between 0 and 1. For example, if the number is 3.5, the method will return 0.5. However, if the number is -3.5, the method will return -0.5, which is not the correct answer. The correct answer should be 0.5, since the integer part of -3.5 is -3, and the decimal part is 0.5.
To fix this problem, you can use the Math.floor method to get the integer part of the number, and then subtract it from the original number to get the decimal part. Here is the updated code:
public double truncateNumber(double number) {
    return number - Math.floor(number);
}

The hasCloseElements method is correct and efficient. It uses a nested loop to compare each pair of numbers in the list, and returns true if it finds any pair that is closer than the given threshold. If it doesn't find any such pair, it returns false.
The separateParenGroups method is correct, but it can be made more efficient by using a stack instead of a StringBuilder to keep track of the current depth and the current string. Here is the updated code:
public List<String> separateParenGroups(String paren_string) {
    List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
    Stack<String> stack = new Stack<>();

    for (char c : paren_string.toCharArray()) {
        if (c == '(') {
            stack.push("(");
        } else if (c == ')') {
            StringBuilder current_string = new StringBuilder();
            while (!stack.isEmpty() && !stack.peek().equals("(")) {
                current_string.insert(0, stack.pop());
            }
            stack.pop(); // remove the "(" from the stack
            current_string.insert(0, "(");
            result.add(current_string.toString());
        }
    }
    return
