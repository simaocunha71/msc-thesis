The problem is that you are not checking for the case when there is only one number in the list. In that case the code will throw an IndexOutOfBoundsException because you are trying to access the index i + 1 which is out of bounds. You can fix this by adding a check to see if the list has more than one element.
Here is the updated code:
public boolean hasCloseElements(List<Double> numbers, double threshold) {
    if (numbers.size() <= 1) {
        return false;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < numbers.size(); j++) {
            double distance = Math.abs(numbers.get(i) - numbers.get(j));
            if (distance < threshold) return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}

The problem is that the code is not considering the case when the input string is empty or contains only spaces. In that case, the code will throw a NullPointerException because it is trying to access the characters of a null string. You can fix this by adding a check to see if the string is empty or contains only spaces.
Here is the updated code:
public List<String> separateParenGroups(String paren_string) {
    List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
    StringBuilder current_string = new StringBuilder();
    int current_depth = 0;

    if (paren_string == null || paren_string.trim().isEmpty()) {
        return result;
    }

    for (char c : paren_string.toCharArray()) {
        if (c == '(') {
            current_depth += 1;
            current_string.append(c);
        } else if (c == ')') {
            current_depth -= 1;
            current_string.append(c);

            if (current_depth == 0) {
                result.add(current_string.toString());
                current_string.setLength(0);
            }
        }
    }
    return result;
}

The problem is that the code is not handling the case when the input number is negative. In that case, the code will return a negative number which is not correct. You can fix this by adding a check to see if the number is negative and returning 0 in that case.
Here is the updated code:
public double truncateNumber(double number) {
    if (number < 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    return number % 1.0;
