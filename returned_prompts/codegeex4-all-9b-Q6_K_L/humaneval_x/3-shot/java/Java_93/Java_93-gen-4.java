The first task is to check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold. The approach is simple, we will iterate through the list and for every pair of numbers we will calculate the absolute difference. If that difference is less than the threshold, we will return true. If we finish the iteration without finding such pair, we will return false.
The second task is to separate groups of parentheses from a string. The approach is simple, we will iterate through the string character by character and keep track of the current depth of parentheses. When we encounter an opening parenthesis, we will increase the depth and add it to the current string. When we encounter a closing parenthesis, we will decrease the depth and add it to the current string. If the depth becomes 0, it means we have finished a group of parentheses and we will add the current string to the result list and reset the current string. Finally, we will return the result list.
The third task is to truncate a number. The approach is simple, we will return the remainder of the number divided by 1.0. This will give us the decimal part of the number.
The fourth task is to encode a message. The approach is simple, we will iterate through the message character by character and for every character we will check if it is uppercase or lowercase. If it is uppercase, we will check if it is a vowel. If it is a vowel, we will replace it with the letter that appears 2 places ahead of that vowel in the english alphabet. If it is not a vowel, we will convert it to lowercase. If it is lowercase, we will check if it is a vowel. If it is a vowel, we will replace it with the letter that appears 2 places
