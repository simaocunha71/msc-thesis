The solutions are correct.
You could make use of the Scanner class in the separateParenGroups method to trim any spaces from the input string and to use it to split the string into groups of parentheses.
For the truncateNumber method, you could use the BigDecimal class to represent the number and then use the stripTrailingZeros method to remove any trailing zeros.
For the sortThird method, you could use the sort method of the Collections class to sort the to_sort list and then use the addAll method of the result list to add all the elements of the to_sort list to the result list in the correct order.
