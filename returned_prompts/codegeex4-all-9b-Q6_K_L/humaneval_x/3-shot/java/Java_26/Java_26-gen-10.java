In the first question, you are using a brute force approach to find if there are two numbers closer to each other than the threshold. This can be improved by using a sorted list and then checking only the adjacent numbers. This will reduce the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n log n) which is a significant improvement for large lists. Here is the improved code:
```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    /**
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.
    >>> hasCloseElements(Arrays.asList(1.0, 2.0, 3.0), 0.5)
    false
    >>> hasCloseElements(Arrays.asList(1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0), 0.3)
    true
     */
    public boolean hasCloseElements(List<Double> numbers, double threshold) {
        Collections.sort(numbers);
        for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size() - 1; i++) {
            if (numbers.get(i + 1) - numbers.get(i) < threshold) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
In the second question, you are correctly using a StringBuilder to build the current string and a counter to track the depth of the parentheses. However, you can improve the code by using a stack to keep track of the start and end indices of each group of parentheses. This will make the code more readable and easier to understand. Here is the improved code:
```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    /**
    Input to this function is a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses. Your goal is to
    separate those group into separate strings and return the list of those.
    Separate groups are balanced (each open brace is properly closed) and not nested within each other
    Ignore any spaces in the input string.
    >>> separateParenGroups("( ) (( )) (( )( ))")
    ["()", "(())", "(()())"]
     */
    public List<String> separateParenGroups(String paren_string) {
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        StringBuilder current_string = new StringBuilder();

        for (int
