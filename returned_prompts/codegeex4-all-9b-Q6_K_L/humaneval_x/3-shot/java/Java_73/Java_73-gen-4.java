Your code looks good! There are a few minor points I'd like to mention:

In Solution class, you can add a Javadoc comment that provides a brief description of the class. This can be useful for anyone who wants to understand what the class is for.
You can add a main method in the Solution class to test your code. This can be useful for debugging and testing your code.
In the hasCloseElements method, you can add a check to see if the input list is empty. If it is, you can return false immediately, as there are no numbers to compare.
In the separateParenGroups method, you can add a check to see if the input string is empty. If it is, you can return an empty list immediately, as there are no parentheses to process.
In the truncateNumber method, you can add a check to see if the input number is negative. If it is, you can return 0, as the decimal part of a negative number is always negative.
In the smallestChange method, you can add a check to see if the input list is empty. If it is, you can return 0 immediately, as there are no elements to compare.

Here's an updated version of your code with these suggestions:

import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

/**
 * This class contains methods for solving various problems.
 */
class Solution {
    /**
     * Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.
     * >>> hasCloseElements(Arrays.asList(1.0, 2.0, 3.0), 0.5)
     * false
     * >>> hasCloseElements(Arrays.asList(1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0), 0.3)
     * true
     */
    public boolean hasCloseElements(List<Double> numbers, double threshold) {
        if (numbers.isEmpty()) {
            return false;
