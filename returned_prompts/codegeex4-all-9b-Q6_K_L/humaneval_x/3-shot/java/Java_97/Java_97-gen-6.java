There are a few things that could be improved in your code.

1. Code readability
Your code is not very readable. For example, in the first question, you have the following code:
for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++) {
    for (int j = i + 1; j < numbers.size(); j++) {
        double distance = Math.abs(numbers.get(i) - numbers.get(j));
        if (distance < threshold) return true;
    }
}
return false;

This code can be improved by using a for-each loop and by removing the unnecessary indentation:
for (Double number1 : numbers) {
    for (Double number2 : numbers) {
        if (number1 != number2) {
            double distance = Math.abs(number1 - number2);
            if (distance < threshold) return true;
        }
    }
}
return false;

2. Code efficiency
Your code is not very efficient. For example, in the first question, you have the following code:
for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++) {
    for (int j = i + 1; j < numbers.size(); j++) {
        double distance = Math.abs(numbers.get(i) - numbers.get(j));
        if (distance < threshold) return true;
    }
}
return false;

This code has a time complexity of O(n^2), which is not very efficient. A more efficient solution would be to sort the list of numbers and then iterate through the sorted list, checking if the difference between consecutive numbers is less than the threshold. Here's an example of how you could implement this solution:
Collections.sort(numbers);
for (int i = 1; i < numbers.size(); i++) {
    double distance = Math.abs(numbers.get(i) - numbers.get(i - 1));
    if (distance < threshold) return true;
}
return false;

3. Code correctness
Your code is not always correct. For example, in the second question, you have the following code:
for (char c : paren_string.toCharArray()) {
    if (c == '(') {
        current_depth += 1;
        current_string.append(c);
    } else if (c == ')') {
        current_depth -= 1;
        current_string.append(c);

        if (current_depth == 0) {
            result.add(current_string.toString());
            current_string.setLength
