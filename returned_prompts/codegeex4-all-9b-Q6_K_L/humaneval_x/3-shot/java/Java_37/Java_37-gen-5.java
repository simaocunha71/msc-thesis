There are a few things that I would like to point out:

There is a lot of redundancy in the code. For example, in Solution#truncateNumber, you can simply return number % 1 instead of 1.0.
In Solution#sortEven, you are creating two lists, even_indices and odd_indices, that you don't really need. You can just use a single list to store the values. Then, you can use a loop to iterate through the list and add the values to the result list. This way, you can avoid creating unnecessary lists.
In Solution#sortEven, you are using the index variable to keep track of the position in the even_indices list. However, you don't need to keep track of the index manually. You can use the Collections.sort method to sort the even_indices list, and then use the get method to retrieve the values from the sorted list.
In Solution#sortEven, you are using the modulo operator (% 2 == 0) to check if the index is even. However, you can use the bitwise AND operator (& 1) to achieve the same result. This is because the bitwise AND operator returns 1 if the number is odd, and 0 if the number is even.
In Solution#sortEven, you are using the setLength method to clear the current_string StringBuilder. However, you can use the setLength method with a parameter of 0 to achieve the same result. This is because the setLength method with a parameter of 0 sets the length of the StringBuilder to 0, effectively clearing it.

Here is the updated code:
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    /**
    Check if in given list
