The first one looks good to me. 
The second one, you need to remove the spaces before checking if you have reached a balanced parenthesis. 
The third one is fine. 
The fourth one is not necessary to check if left is less than zero. You can just set it to zero. 
Overall, I think you are doing a good job.
