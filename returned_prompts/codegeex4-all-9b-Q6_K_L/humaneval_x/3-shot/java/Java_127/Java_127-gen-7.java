The first code snippet is fine. It has a time complexity of O(n^2) which is fine for this problem, because the number of elements in the list is expected to be small (2-3 elements).
The second code snippet is fine too. It has a time complexity of O(n) which is fine for this problem, because the number of characters in the string is expected to be small (2-3 characters).
The third code snippet is fine too. It has a time complexity of O(1) which is fine for this problem, because the number of elements in the list is expected to be small (2-3 elements).
The fourth code snippet is fine too. It has a time complexity of O(n) which is fine for this problem, because the number of elements in the list is expected to be small (2-3 elements). However, the isPrime function has a time complexity of O(sqrt(n)) which is not efficient for large numbers. You can improve this by using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate a list of prime numbers up to a certain limit, and then check if the intersection_length is in this list. This will reduce the time complexity of the isPrime function to O(1).
