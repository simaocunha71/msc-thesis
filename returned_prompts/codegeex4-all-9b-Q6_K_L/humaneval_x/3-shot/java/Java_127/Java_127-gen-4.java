In the hasCloseElements method you are using 2 for loops which results in a time complexity of O(n^2). This means that for every new number you add to the list, you will need to do a full pass over all other numbers. This is very inefficient especially if you have a large list of numbers. A better approach would be to sort the list first and then iterate through it once, which would result in a time complexity of O(n log n). Here's an example of how you could do it:
public boolean hasCloseElements(List<Double> numbers, double threshold) {
    Collections.sort(numbers);
    for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size() - 1; i++) {
        if (numbers.get(i + 1) - numbers.get(i) < threshold) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}

In the separateParenGroups method you are using a StringBuilder to build the current string and a int to keep track of the current depth. This is a good approach, but you could also use a Stack to keep track of the current depth. This would make the code a bit more concise and easier to understand. Here's an example of how you could do it:
public List<String> separateParenGroups(String paren_string) {
    List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
    Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();
    StringBuilder current_string = new StringBuilder();

    for (char c : paren_string.toCharArray()) {
        if (c == '(') {
            stack.push(c);
            current_string.append(c);
        } else if (c == ')') {
            stack.pop();
            current_string.append(c);

            if (stack.isEmpty()) {
                result.add(current_string.toString());
                current_string.setLength(0);
            }
        }
    }
    return result;
}

In the truncateNumber method you are using the modulus operator to get the decimal part of the number. This is a good approach, but you could also use
