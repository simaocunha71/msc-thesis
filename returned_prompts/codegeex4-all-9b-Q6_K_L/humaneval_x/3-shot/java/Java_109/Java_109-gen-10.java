for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++) {
    for (int j = i + 1; j < numbers.size(); j++) {
        double distance = Math.abs(numbers.get(i) - numbers.get(j));
        if (distance < threshold) return true;
    }
}
return false;

The logic here is correct but it can be optimized. The code is currently checking every possible pair of numbers in the list. However, there is no need to check every pair. If we find a pair of numbers that are closer than the threshold, we can return true immediately. Additionally, we can break out of the inner loop once we find a pair that is too close, since we don't need to check any further pairs.

public boolean hasCloseElements(List<Double> numbers, double threshold) {
    for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < numbers.size(); j++) {
            double distance = Math.abs(numbers.get(i) - numbers.get(j));
            if (distance < threshold) return true;
            if (distance >= 2 * threshold) break;
        }
    }
    return false;
}

This optimized code will have a better time complexity, especially when the list of numbers is large.

for (char c : paren_string.toCharArray()) {
    if (c == '(') {
        current_depth += 1;
        current_string.append(c);
    } else if (c == ')') {
        current_depth -= 1;
        current_string.append(c);

        if (current_depth == 0) {
            result.add(current_string.toString());
            current_string.setLength(0);
        }
    }
}
return result;

The logic here is correct but it can be optimized. The code is currently checking every character in the input string. However, there is no need to check every character. We can break out of the loop once we find a closing parenthesis that matches the opening parenthesis we found earlier.

public List<String> separateParenGroups(String paren_string) {
    List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
    StringBuilder current_string
