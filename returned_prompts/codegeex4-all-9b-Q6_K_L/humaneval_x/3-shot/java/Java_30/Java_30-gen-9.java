This is a very good exercise.
I will give you some feedback for each of your solutions.
The first question asks to check if there are two numbers in the list that are within the threshold of each other.
Your solution is correct and efficient.
Here's a suggestion: instead of using two nested loops, you can use a single loop and keep track of the minimum and maximum values seen so far. If at any point the difference between the current number and the minimum is less than the threshold, or if the difference between the current number and the maximum is less than the threshold, you can return true immediately.
The second question asks to separate groups of nested parentheses into separate strings.
Your solution is correct and efficient.
Here's a suggestion: instead of using a StringBuilder to build the current string, you can use a StringJoiner. This will make the code more concise and readable.
The third question asks to truncate a floating point number to its decimal part.
Your solution is correct and efficient.
Here's a suggestion: instead of using the modulo operator, you can multiply the number by 10 and then take the integer part. This will give you the same result, but it might be more intuitive.
The fourth question asks to return only the positive numbers from a list.
Your solution is correct and efficient.
Here's a suggestion: instead of using a stream, you can use a simple for loop and add the positive numbers to a new list. This will make the code more readable and easier to understand.
Overall, your solutions are correct, efficient, and well-written.
