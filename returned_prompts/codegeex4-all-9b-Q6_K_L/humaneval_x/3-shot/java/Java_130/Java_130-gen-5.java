This is a very good start! I see a few things that can be improved:

Variable naming: Use more descriptive names for variables. For example, "numbers" is not very descriptive. Try "numberList" or "sequence" instead.
Code organization: It's a good practice to separate the input from the processing. In other words, you should have a method that takes an input and returns the result, and another method that does the actual processing. This makes the code easier to understand and maintain.
Error handling: Your code does not handle the case where the input list is empty. You should add a check for this case and return an appropriate result.
Comments: Your comments are good, but you can make them more descriptive. For example, instead of "Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold", you can say "Check if any two numbers in the given list are closer to each other than the specified threshold".
Documentation: Add a documentation comment for each method that explains what it does, what parameters it takes, and what it returns. This will make the code easier to understand and use.

Here's an updated version of your code with these improvements:

import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    /**
    Check if any two numbers in the given list are closer to each other than the specified threshold.
    @param numberList the list of numbers to check
    @param threshold the maximum allowed distance between two numbers
    @return true if any two numbers are closer than the threshold, false otherwise
     */
    public boolean hasCloseElements(List<Double> numberList, double threshold) {
        if (numberList.isEmpty()) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Input list cannot be empty");
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < numberList.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < numberList.size(); j++) {
                double distance = Math.abs(numberList.get(i) - numberList.get(j));
                if (distance < threshold) {
                    return true;
