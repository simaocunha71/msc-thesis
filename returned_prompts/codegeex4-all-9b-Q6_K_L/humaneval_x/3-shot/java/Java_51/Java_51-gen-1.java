Your code is correct, it's just that you can make it more efficient by skipping the first loop entirely. Since you're looking for two numbers that are closer than the threshold, you can stop checking once you've checked all pairs of numbers that could possibly be closer than the threshold. This can be done by checking the difference between the first number in the list and the last number in the list, and then stopping if this difference is less than or equal to the threshold.
Here's the updated code:
public boolean hasCloseElements(List<Double> numbers, double threshold) {
    double max = numbers.get(numbers.size() - 1);
    double min = numbers.get(0);
    double diff = max - min;

    if (diff <= threshold) {
        return true;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < numbers.size(); j++) {
            double distance = Math.abs(numbers.get(i) - numbers.get(j));
            if (distance < threshold) return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
