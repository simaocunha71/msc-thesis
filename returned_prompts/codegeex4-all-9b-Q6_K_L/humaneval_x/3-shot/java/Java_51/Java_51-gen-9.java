You have a lot of good code there, but there are a few things I'd like to point out:

The first two questions have a very similar structure. In the first, you have to determine whether there are any two numbers within a given threshold, whereas the second question involves determining whether there are any two numbers within a given threshold. The only difference is that the second question involves two nested loops. I'd like you to consider whether or not this is really necessary. In the first question, you can simply loop through the list of numbers once, and for each number, you can loop through the rest of the list to see if any of the numbers are within the threshold. This would reduce the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n).

The third question involves determining the decimal part of a number. You've used the modulo operator to do this, which is a good idea. However, there is a potential issue with this approach. If the number is negative, the result of the modulo operation will be negative. To fix this, you can simply add 1 to the result before returning it.

The fourth question involves removing vowels from a string. You've used the replaceAll method to do this, which is a good idea. However, there is a potential issue with this approach. If the string contains any non-alphabetic characters, they will also be removed. To fix this, you can simply use the regular expression "[aeiouAEIOU]" to match only vowels.

Overall, your code is well-written and easy to understand. However, there are a few potential issues with the questions you've asked. I hope these suggestions help you improve your code!
