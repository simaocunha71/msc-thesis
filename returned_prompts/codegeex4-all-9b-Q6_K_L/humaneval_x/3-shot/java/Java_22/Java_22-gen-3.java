Your code is mostly correct, but there are a few issues to address:

In the separateParenGroups method, you are not handling the case where the parentheses are not balanced. This can be fixed by adding a check to ensure that the current depth is never negative. If it is, you should throw an exception or handle it in some other way.
In the filterIntergers method, you are not handling the case where the object is not an Integer. This can be fixed by adding a check to ensure that the object is an Integer before attempting to cast it. If it is not, you should ignore it or handle it in some other way.
In the truncateNumber method, you are not handling the case where the number is negative. This can be fixed by adding a check to ensure that the number is positive before performing the truncation. If it is not, you should throw an exception or handle it in some other way.

Here is the corrected code:

import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    /**
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.
    >>> hasCloseElements(Arrays.asList(1.0, 2.0, 3.0), 0.5)
    false
    >>> hasCloseElements(Arrays.asList(1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0), 0.3)
    true
     */
    public boolean hasCloseElements(List<Double> numbers, double threshold) {
        for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < numbers.size(); j++) {
                double distance = Math.abs(numbers.get(i) - numbers.get(j));
                if (distance < threshold) return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
