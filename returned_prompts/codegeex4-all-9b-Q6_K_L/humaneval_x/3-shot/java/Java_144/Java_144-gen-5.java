For the first question, I would recommend using a priority queue instead of a list. This is because the priority queue will automatically sort the numbers as they are added, so you don't need to sort them yourself. You can then simply check if the difference between the top two numbers in the queue is less than the threshold.
Here's an example of how you could implement this:
```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public boolean hasCloseElements(List<Double> numbers, double threshold) {
        PriorityQueue<Double> queue = new PriorityQueue<>();
        for (double number : numbers) {
            queue.add(number);
        }
        while (queue.size() > 1) {
            double difference = Math.abs(queue.poll() - queue.poll());
            if (difference < threshold) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
For the second question, your code looks correct. You are iterating through the string character by character, and adding to a new string whenever you encounter a closing parenthesis. You are also keeping track of the current depth of parentheses, and adding to the result list whenever the depth returns to zero. This is a good approach, and your code is well-organized and easy to understand.
Here's the code again for reference:
```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public List<String> separateParenGroups(String paren_string) {
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        StringBuilder current_string = new StringBuilder();
        int current_depth = 0;

        for (char c : paren_string.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == '(') {
                current_depth += 1;
                current_string.append(c);
            } else if (c == ')') {
                current_depth -= 1;
                current_string.append(c);

                if (current_depth == 0) {
                    result.add(current_string.toString());
                    current_string.setLength(0);
                }
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
For the third question, your code is also correct. You are simply using the modulus operator to find the decimal part of the number. This
