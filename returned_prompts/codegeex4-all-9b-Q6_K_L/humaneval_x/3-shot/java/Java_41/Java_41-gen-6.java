The first question is a simple nested loop that checks for any two numbers that are closer than the threshold. If it finds a pair that is closer, it returns true, otherwise, it returns false.
The second question is a bit more complex. It iterates through the input string, checking for opening and closing parentheses. If it finds an opening parenthesis, it increments a counter and appends the character to a current string. If it finds a closing parenthesis, it decrements the counter and appends the character to the current string. If the counter is zero, it means that a complete group of parentheses has been found, so it adds the current string to the result list and resets the current string. Finally, it returns the result list.
The third question is a simple calculation that returns the decimal part of a number. It uses the modulus operator to find the remainder of dividing the number by 1, which is always the decimal part of the number.
The last question is a bit more complex. It asks for the number of collisions between cars driving in opposite directions. However, the function is not implemented yet, so it returns 0.
