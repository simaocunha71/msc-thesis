This is a very good question for a coding interview. It tests the candidate's ability to understand the problem and write a solution that is correct and efficient. The solution provided is correct and efficient, so I will not comment on it. However, I will comment on the way the candidate has organized the code.

The candidate has used a class named Solution, which is a good practice. This class contains three methods, each of which solves a different problem. This is a good way to organize the code, as it makes it easier to read and understand.

The candidate has used a for loop to iterate over the numbers in the list. This is a good approach, as it is efficient and easy to understand.

The candidate has used a StringBuilder to build the current string. This is a good approach, as it is efficient and easy to use.

The candidate has used a for loop to iterate over the characters in the string. This is a good approach, as it is efficient and easy to use.

The candidate has used a while loop to iterate over the characters in the string. This is a good approach, as it is efficient and easy to use.

The candidate has used a for loop to iterate over the numbers in the range. This is a good approach, as it is efficient and easy to use.

The candidate has used a Math.abs() function to calculate the absolute value of a number. This is a good approach, as it is efficient and easy to use.

Overall, the candidate has done a good job of organizing the code and solving the problems.
