Your code is mostly good. However, there are some points that need to be addressed:

In the first question, you are using a nested loop that compares all pairs of elements in the list. This is correct, but it can be optimized to avoid unnecessary comparisons. You can use a TreeSet to store the differences between consecutive elements, and then check if the minimum difference is less than the threshold.

In the second question, you are using a StringBuilder to build the current string. This is correct, but you can simplify the code by using a Stack<Character> to keep track of the parentheses. You can push '(' onto the stack when you encounter it, and pop '(' when you encounter ')'. If the stack is empty when you encounter ')', it means that the parentheses are not balanced.

In the third question, you are using the modulo operator to truncate the number. This is correct, but you can simplify the code by using the Math.floor() method to get the integer part of the number, and then subtract it from the original number to get the decimal part.

In the fourth question, you are using a HashSet to store the unique characters in each word. This is correct, but you can simplify the code by using a HashMap<Character, Integer> to count the occurrences of each character. Then, you can find the word with the maximum number of unique characters by comparing the sizes of the HashMaps.

Here is the modified code:

import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    /**
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.
    >>> hasCloseElements(Arrays.asList(1.0, 2.0, 3.0), 0.5)
    false
    >>> hasCloseElements(Arrays.asList(1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0), 0.
