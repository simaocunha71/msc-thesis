1. You can optimize your solution for the first question by using a set to check for duplicates. This will make your solution more efficient when the list is long.
2. You can optimize your solution for the second question by using a stack to keep track of the parentheses. This will make your solution more efficient when the string is long.
3. You can optimize your solution for the third question by using the built-in Java function Math.floor. This will make your solution more efficient and easier to read.
4. You can optimize your solution for the fourth question by using the built-in Java function Math.sqrt. This will make your solution more efficient and easier to read.
5. You can optimize your solution for the fifth question by using the built-in Java function Math.sqrt. This will make your solution more efficient and easier to read.
