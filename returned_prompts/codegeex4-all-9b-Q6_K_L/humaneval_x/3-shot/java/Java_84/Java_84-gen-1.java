I see a few things that could improve your code:

Add Javadoc to your classes and methods. This helps other developers understand what your code is supposed to do.
Use a switch statement instead of if-else for the separateParenGroups() method. This makes it easier to add new cases as your code evolves.
Use a StringBuilder instead of a String for the separateParenGroups() method. This is more efficient when concatenating strings.
Use a for-each loop instead of a for loop for the truncateNumber() method. This makes it easier to read and understand.
Use a for-each loop instead of a for loop for the solve() method. This makes it easier to read and understand.
Use the Math.round() method instead of the Character.getNumericValue() method for the solve() method. This is more efficient.

Here's an updated version of your code with these changes:

import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    /**
     * Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.
     * >>> hasCloseElements(Arrays.asList(1.0, 2.0, 3.0), 0.5)
     * false
     * >>> hasCloseElements(Arrays.asList(1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0), 0.3)
     * true
     */
    public boolean hasCloseElements(List<Double> numbers, double threshold) {
        for (Double number : numbers) {
            for (Double otherNumber : numbers) {
                if (number.equals(otherNumber)) {
                    continue;
                }
                double distance = Math.abs(number - otherNumber);
                if (distance < threshold) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    /**

     * separate those group into separate strings and return the list of those.
