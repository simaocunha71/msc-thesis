Your first and last questions are very similar.  They both iterate over the characters of a string and increment a counter when they find a certain character.  The first question is a little different, because it also has to handle the case where the character is a digit (in which case you return the number of digits that follow it).
The second question could be more efficient if you used a Set to store the vowels.  This would make the condition inside the loop shorter.  You could also make the loop shorter by using a for-each loop instead of a traditional for loop.

The third question could be more efficient if you used a regular expression to find the vowels.  This would make the loop shorter and possibly faster.  You could also make the loop shorter by using the String replaceAll method to remove all non-vowel characters from the string.

The fourth question could be more efficient if you used a regular expression to find the vowels.  This would make the loop shorter and possibly faster.  You could also make the loop shorter by using the String replaceAll method to remove all non-vowel characters from the string.
