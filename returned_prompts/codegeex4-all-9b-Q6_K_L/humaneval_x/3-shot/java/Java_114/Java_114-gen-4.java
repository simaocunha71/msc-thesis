1. The first question is correct and well written. It doesn't need any changes.

2. The second question needs a minor modification. In the first for loop, you are using a for-each loop, which is not necessary here. You can directly use an index based loop. Also, the variable 'current_depth' should be initialized to 1, not 0, because the first parenthesis is an open parenthesis.

3. The third question is correct and well written. It doesn't need any changes.

4. The fourth question can be improved. The nested loop is not necessary here. You can use a single loop to iterate through the list and calculate the sum of each sub-array. Also, you should initialize 'min_sum' to the first element of the list, not the maximum possible integer value.
