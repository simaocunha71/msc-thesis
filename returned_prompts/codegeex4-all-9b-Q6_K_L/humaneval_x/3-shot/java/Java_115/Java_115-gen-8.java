Q1:
This solution is correct. It checks all possible pairs of numbers and returns true if any of them is within the threshold. The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the size of the list.
Q2:
This solution is correct. It iterates over the input string and keeps track of the current depth of parentheses. When it encounters an opening parenthesis, it increases the depth and adds it to the current string. When it encounters a closing parenthesis, it decreases the depth and adds it to the current string. If the depth becomes zero, it means that a group of parentheses has been closed and it adds the current string to the result list. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
Q3:
This solution is correct. It uses the modulus operator to calculate the decimal part of the number. The time complexity of this solution is O(1).
Q4:
This solution is correct. It iterates over the grid and finds the maximum number of units of water in any well. Then it divides this maximum number by the bucket capacity to find the number of times the buckets need to be lowered. The time complexity of this solution is O(m*n), where m and n are the dimensions of the grid.
