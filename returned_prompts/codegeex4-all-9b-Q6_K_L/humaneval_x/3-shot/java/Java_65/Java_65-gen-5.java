Your first and last questions are pretty much identical, so I'll address both of them at once. You have a loop that iterates through the list of numbers, and for each element in the list, you're checking every other element in the list to see if it's within a certain threshold. There are a few issues with this:

The inner loop is always running through all elements in the list. If you find a pair of numbers that are within the threshold, you'll break out of the loop and return true, but you'll keep running through the rest of the list, which is unnecessary. You could simply return true as soon as you find a pair of numbers that are within the threshold, and if you reach the end of the list without finding any pair of numbers within the threshold, you could return false.
Your code does not check if the two numbers are actually different. If the two numbers are the same, you should return false, but your code will return true in that case.

Here's a revised version of your code:

public boolean hasCloseElements(List<Double> numbers, double threshold) {
    for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < numbers.size(); j++) {
            double distance = Math.abs(numbers.get(i) - numbers.get(j));
            if (distance < threshold && numbers.get(i) != numbers.get(j)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}

Your second question is similar to the first one, but it's a bit more complex. You're iterating through the input string, and for each character, you're updating the current depth and the current string. There are a few issues with this:

You're initializing the current depth to 0, which is correct, but you're not initializing the current string. You should initialize it to an empty string.
You're appending parentheses to the current string, but you're not checking if the parentheses are balanced. You should keep track of the current depth, and only append parentheses to the current string if the current depth is greater than 0.
You're checking if the current depth is 0, but you're not checking if the current string is empty
