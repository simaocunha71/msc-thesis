Your first function is correct, the other three are not.

separateParenGroups

You have a couple of issues here.
Firstly, your code doesn't handle the case where the string does not contain a balanced set of parentheses. This will result in a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException. You can handle this by checking the current depth of the parentheses at the end of the loop.
Secondly, the current implementation will not work correctly if there are spaces in the string. You can fix this by adding a condition to skip over spaces.
Lastly, the code can be simplified by using StringBuilder to build up the current string instead of using append and setLength. This is more efficient and makes the code easier to read.

truncateNumber

This function is correct, but it can be simplified by using the Math.floor method.

specialFactorial

This function is incorrect. The formula for the Brazilian factorial is n! * (n-1)! * (n-2)! * ... * 1!. This is not the same as the factorial of n. The correct implementation is:

public long specialFactorial(int n) {
    long result = 1;
    for (int i = n; i >= 1; i--) {
        result *= i;
    }
    return result * specialFactorial(n - 1);
}

This will result in the correct value for the Brazilian factorial.
