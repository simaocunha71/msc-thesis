1. hasCloseElements
Your function is already correct. Just a small improvement would be to iterate through the list in reverse order, that way you can return as soon as you find two close elements.
2. separateParenGroups
Your function is already correct. Just a small improvement would be to use StringBuilder's appendCodePoint method instead of append when dealing with char. This is because appendCodePoint is more efficient when dealing with Unicode characters.
3. truncateNumber
Your function is already correct. Just a small improvement would be to use Math.floorMod instead of % to truncate the number.
4. isSimplePower
Your function is already correct. Just a small improvement would be to use Math.pow instead of a for loop to check if x is a simple power of n. This is because Math.pow is more efficient when dealing with floating point numbers.
