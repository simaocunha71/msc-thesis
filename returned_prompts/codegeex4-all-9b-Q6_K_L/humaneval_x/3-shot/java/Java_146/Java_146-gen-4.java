1) Your hasCloseElements method seems correct, though it may be better to use a for-each loop with an enhanced for loop:
for (Double num1 : numbers) {
    for (Double num2 : numbers) {
        // rest of your code
    }
}

2) Your separateParenGroups method is correct. However, it will not handle cases where there are spaces inside the parentheses. You may want to remove them before processing the string:
paren_string = paren_string.replaceAll("\\s+", "");

3) Your truncateNumber method is correct.

4) Your specialFilter method is correct, though it can be made more efficient by using the modulo operator (%) to check if a number is odd:
if (n > 10 && n % 2 == 1) {
    // rest of your code
}

Here's the updated code:

import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    /**
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.
    >>> hasCloseElements(Arrays.asList(1.0, 2.0, 3.0), 0.5)
    false
    >>> hasCloseElements(Arrays.asList(1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0), 0.3)
    true
     */
    public boolean hasCloseElements(List<Double> numbers, double threshold) {
        for (Double num1 : numbers) {
            for (Double num2 : numbers) {
                double distance = Math.abs(num1 - num2);
                if (distance < threshold) return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    /**
    Input to this function is a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses. Your goal is to
    separate those group into separate strings and return the list of those.
    Separate groups are balanced (each open brace is properly closed) and not nested within each other
    Ignore any spaces in the input string
