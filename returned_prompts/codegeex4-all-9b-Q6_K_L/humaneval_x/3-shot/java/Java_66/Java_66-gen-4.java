hasCloseElements

This is a classic problem that can be solved by sorting the list and checking adjacent elements. Sorting the list makes it easier to check if any two elements are within the threshold. The time complexity of this approach is O(n log n) due to the sorting step. The space complexity is O(1) as we are not using any additional data structures.
```java
public boolean hasCloseElements(List<Double> numbers, double threshold) {
    Collections.sort(numbers);
    for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size() - 1; i++) {
        if (numbers.get(i + 1) - numbers.get(i) < threshold) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

separateParenGroups

The problem can be solved by using a stack to keep track of the open parentheses. Whenever we encounter a closing parenthesis, we pop the stack and add the current group to the result list. The time complexity of this approach is O(n) and the space complexity is O(n) as we are using a stack to keep track of the open parentheses.
```java
public List<String> separateParenGroups(String paren_string) {
    List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
    Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();
    StringBuilder current_string = new StringBuilder();

    for (char c : paren_string.toCharArray()) {
        if (c == '(') {
            stack.push(c);
            current_string.append(c);
        } else if (c == ')') {
            stack.pop();
            current_string.append(c);

            if (stack.isEmpty()) {
                result.add(current_string.toString());
                current_string.setLength(0);
            }
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

truncateNumber

This can be solved by subtracting the integer part from the given number. The time complexity of this approach is O(1) and the space complexity is O(1) as we are not using any additional data structures.
```java
public double truncateNumber(double number) {
    return number - (int) number;
}
```

digitSum

This can be solved by iterating through the string and adding the ASCII code of each upper case character to a running sum. The time complexity
