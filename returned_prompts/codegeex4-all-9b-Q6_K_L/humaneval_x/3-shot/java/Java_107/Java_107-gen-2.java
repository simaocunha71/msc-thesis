The first method you wrote is not correct. You are missing a check for when the distance is equal to the threshold. You should return true when the distance is equal to the threshold as well.

for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++) {
    for (int j = i + 1; j < numbers.size(); j++) {
        double distance = Math.abs(numbers.get(i) - numbers.get(j));
        if (distance < threshold) return true;
    }
}
return false;

I would also consider using a set to check for duplicates, but this is more of a personal preference.

The second method is correct, but it can be improved by using a stack. This would make the code more efficient and easier to understand.

List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
StringBuilder current_string = new StringBuilder();
int current_depth = 0;

for (char c : paren_string.toCharArray()) {
    if (c == '(') {
        current_depth += 1;
        current_string.append(c);
    } else if (c == ')') {
        current_depth -= 1;
        current_string.append(c);

        if (current_depth == 0) {
            result.add(current_string.toString());
            current_string.setLength(0);
        }
    }
}
return result;

The third method is correct, but it can be improved by using the Math.floor() method.

public double truncateNumber(double number) {
    return number % 1.0;
}

I would also consider using the Math.IEEEremainder() method, but this is more of a personal preference.

The fourth method is correct, but it can be improved by using a StringBuilder to build the string.

public List
