Your code seems to be correct and well written. I don't have any other suggestions, but I will point out a few things you can do to improve it:

1. Add comments to explain what your code does, especially in the cases where the logic is not immediately obvious.
2. Use meaningful variable names. For example, instead of using i and j in your first question, you could use left and right to indicate that they are used as pointers to the beginning and end of the list.
3. Consider using a for-each loop instead of a traditional for loop when iterating over a collection. For example, in your second question, you could use:
for (char c : paren_string.toCharArray()) {
    // ...
}

instead of:
for (int i = 0; i < paren_string.length(); i++) {
    char c = paren_string.charAt(i);
    // ...
}

4. In your third question, you could use a StringBuilder to build the string representation of the number instead of using String.valueOf(). This would be more efficient, especially for large numbers.
5. In your fourth question, you could use a loop to iterate over the range(1, n) instead of using a for loop. For example:
for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    if (isPalindrome(i)) {
        // ...
    }
}

instead of:
for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    if (isPalindrome(i)) {
        // ...
    }
}

Overall, your code is well-written and follows good coding practices. I'm glad you asked for feedback!
