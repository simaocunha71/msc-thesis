The first question has a problem in its test suite. In the test case:
>>> hasCloseElements(Arrays.asList(1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0), 0.3)
true

The function hasCloseElements should return false, because there's no pair of numbers in the list that are closer than 0.3. The function is returning true because the distance between 2.8 and 3.0 is 0.2, which is less than the threshold 0.3. This is a mistake in the question, not in the function.

For the second question, the implementation is correct. It correctly separates the groups of parentheses into separate strings and returns the list of those.

For the third question, the implementation is correct. It correctly returns the decimal part of the number.

For the fourth question, the implementation is correct. It correctly counts the number of even and odd integer palindromes that fall within the range(1, n), inclusive.
