I have a few comments about your code:

Use a more meaningful class name, like NumberUtils, StringUtils or some other name that describes what the class does.
Avoid using the built-in classes for things that are more specific, like StringBuilder when you can just use a string variable.
Don't use the class name as a comment at the beginning of each method, it's redundant. Comment on what the method does, not what it is.
Try to make your code more readable by adding some spaces and newlines. It's not hard, but it makes the code easier to read, and makes it easier for others to understand.
Avoid using magic numbers, like 0.5 and 1.0. Instead, use a variable or constant, like double threshold = 0.5; or double ONE = 1.0;
Avoid using the same variable name for different purposes, like current_string and current_depth. Instead, use different variable names, like currentGroup and groupDepth.
Avoid using the same variable name for different types, like distance. Instead, use different variable names, like distanceBetweenNumbers and distanceBetweenPoints.
Avoid using the same variable name for different scopes, like numbers. Instead, use different variable names, like numbersList and numbersArray.
