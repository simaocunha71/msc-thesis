There's no need to use double literals for the modulus operation, you can just use 1 instead of 1.0.
You could simplify the Fibonacci calculation by using a while loop and only storing the last two numbers, rather than the whole sequence.
The isPrime method could be optimized by checking divisibility up to the square root of n, rather than up to n.
The isPrime method could be optimized further by checking divisibility up to the square root of n, rather than up to n.
