The first problem hasCloseElements is correct and optimal. It's O(n^2). You can't do better without extra information. In the worst case, all numbers are the same, so you have to compare each pair. If you can assume that the numbers are sorted, you can do it in O(n) with a single pass.

The second problem separateParenGroups is incorrect. It doesn't handle the case when there are spaces between parentheses. For example, it returns ["((()))", "(())"] for the input "( ) (( )) (( )( ))", instead of ["()", "(())", "(()())"].

The third problem truncateNumber is incorrect. It returns 0.5 for 3.5, but it should return 0.5 for 3.51.

The fourth problem primeFib is incorrect. It doesn't handle the case when n is 0 or negative. It also doesn't handle the case when n is too large, such as 1000000. The Fibonacci sequence grows exponentially, so the 1000000-th Fibonacci number has 2089 digits. You can't represent it with an int. You also don't need to check whether each Fibonacci number is prime. You can use a sieve to generate all prime numbers up to the 1000000-th Fibonacci number, and then return the n-th prime Fibonacci number.
