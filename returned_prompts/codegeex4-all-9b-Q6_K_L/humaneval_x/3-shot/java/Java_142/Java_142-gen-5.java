Your first question is asking you to implement a function to determine if there are any two numbers in a list that are within a certain distance of each other. This can be done by iterating through the list and comparing each pair of numbers. If any pair is closer than the given threshold, return true. Otherwise, return false.
The second question is asking you to implement a function to separate groups of nested parentheses from a given string. This can be done by iterating through the string and keeping track of the current depth of nesting. Whenever a closing parenthesis is encountered, check if the current depth is zero. If it is, then you have reached the end of a group and can add it to the result list. If the current depth is not zero, then the group is still nested and you should continue iterating. Finally, return the result list.
The third question is asking you to implement a function to truncate a given floating point number. This can be done by subtracting the integer part of the number from the original number. The integer part can be obtained by casting the number to an integer or by using the floor function.
The fourth question is asking you to implement a function to sum the squares of a list of integers. This can be done by iterating through the list and checking the index of each element. If the index is a multiple of 3, square the element and add it to the sum. If the index is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3, cube the element and add it to the sum. If the index is not a multiple of 3 or 4, simply add the element to the sum. Finally, return the sum.
