Your methods are well-named and their comments are pretty good. You have decent variable names and your code is readable. You're using a StringBuilder, which is good. Your for loops are well structured and your use of if-else is clear and easy to understand.
One minor thing I noticed is that you're using the same name for the return value in the separateParenGroups method. You might want to consider renaming it to match the rest of the method's return type. For example, you could rename it to "parenGroups" or something similar.
Overall, your code is well-written and easy to follow.
