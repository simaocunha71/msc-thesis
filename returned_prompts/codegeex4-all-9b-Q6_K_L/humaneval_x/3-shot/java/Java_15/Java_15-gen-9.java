The first question is a simple brute-force solution. It's not the most efficient solution, but it's simple and easy to understand.
The second question is also a brute-force solution, but it's more complicated. It requires parsing the string and keeping track of the current depth of parentheses.
The third question is also a brute-force solution. It requires converting the number to a string and then parsing the string to extract the decimal part.
The fourth question is also a brute-force solution. It requires iterating over the range from 0 to n and building a string with the numbers separated by spaces.
