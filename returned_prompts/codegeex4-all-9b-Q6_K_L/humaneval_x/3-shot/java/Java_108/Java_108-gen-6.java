            double distance = Math.abs(numbers.get(i) - numbers.get(j));

This method is O(n^2), which is not very efficient. You could consider a sort and linear scan, or a binary search and linear scan, or a two-pointer approach. However, the latter requires the list to be sorted or to be able to sort it in place. The former two are pretty easy to implement.

public List<String> separateParenGroups(String paren_string) {

    List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
    StringBuilder current_string = new StringBuilder();
    int current_depth = 0;

    for (char c : paren_string.toCharArray()) {
        if (c == '(') {
            current_depth += 1;
            current_string.append(c);
        } else if (c == ')') {
            current_depth -= 1;
            current_string.append(c);

            if (current_depth == 0) {
                result.add(current_string.toString());
                current_string.setLength(0);
            }
        }
    }
    return result;

}

This code can be shortened. Also, it may be more efficient to use a StringBuilder instead of a String. However, this will make the code less readable. I would not recommend this unless you are sure the string is really big and this really makes a difference. The main problem with this code is that it does not handle spaces. You could use a String.split("[()]") to split the string into an array of strings, and then iterate over this array. You could also use a regular expression to match the parentheses, but this is probably overkill.
