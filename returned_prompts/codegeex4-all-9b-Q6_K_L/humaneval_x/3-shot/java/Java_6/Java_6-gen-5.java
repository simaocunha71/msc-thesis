The first code you posted is correct, but it's not very efficient. It has a time complexity of O(n^2), which means that if you have n elements, it will take n^2 operations to find the result. This can be improved by sorting the list first, which will result in a time complexity of O(n log n), which is much better.
Here's an improved version of the first code:
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    /**
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.
    >>> hasCloseElements(Arrays.asList(1.0, 2.0, 3.0), 0.5)
    false
    >>> hasCloseElements(Arrays.asList(1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0), 0.3)
    true
     */
    public boolean hasCloseElements(List<Double> numbers, double threshold) {
        // Sort the list first
        Collections.sort(numbers);

        // Iterate through the list
        for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size() - 1; i++) {
            // Check if the current number is closer to the next number than the threshold
            if (numbers.get(i + 1) - numbers.get(i) < threshold) {
                return true;
            }
        }

        // No two numbers are closer than the threshold
        return false;
    }
}

The second code is also correct, but it's not very efficient either. It has a time complexity of O(n^2), which means that if you have n elements, it will take n^2 operations to find the result. This can be improved by using a stack to keep track of the current depth of nesting, which will result in a time complexity of O(n), which is much better.
