In the first problem, you have a double for loop to iterate over each pair of numbers in the list. You can do this more efficiently with a single loop and a single comparison per loop iteration. This will also make the code easier to understand.
public boolean hasCloseElements(List<Double> numbers, double threshold) {
    for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size() - 1; i++) {
        if (Math.abs(numbers.get(i) - numbers.get(i + 1)) < threshold) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}

In the second problem, you have a loop that iterates over each character in the string. You can use a StringBuilder to build the current string and keep track of the current depth in a single loop. This will make the code more efficient and easier to understand.
public List<String> separateParenGroups(String paren_string) {
    List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
    StringBuilder current_string = new StringBuilder();
    int current_depth = 0;

    for (char c : paren_string.toCharArray()) {
        if (c == '(') {
            current_depth += 1;
            current_string.append(c);
        } else if (c == ')') {
            current_depth -= 1;
            current_string.append(c);

            if (current_depth == 0) {
                result.add(current_string.toString());
                current_string.setLength(0);
            }
        }
    }
    return result;
}

In the third problem, you have a loop that iterates over each character in the string. You can use a StringBuilder to build the result string and keep track of whether the string contains any letters in a single loop. This will make the code more efficient and easier to understand.
public double truncateNumber(double number) {
    return number % 1.0;
}

In the fourth problem, you have a loop that iterates over each character in the string. You can use a StringBuilder to build the result string and keep track
