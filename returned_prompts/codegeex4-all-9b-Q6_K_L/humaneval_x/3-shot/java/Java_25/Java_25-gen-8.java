You have a few things to fix in your code:

Your class declaration is missing the public keyword, which makes it impossible for the compiler to find and use the class. Add public to your class declaration like so:
public class Solution

Your class does not have a main method. This is required for a Java application to run. Add a main method to your class like so:
public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Your code here
}

Your hasCloseElements method is not returning anything when the loop completes without finding any close elements. This is a problem because the method is declared to return a boolean. Add a return statement to your method like so:
return false;

Your separateParenGroups method does not handle the case where the input string does not have balanced parentheses. This is a problem because the method is declared to return a list of strings, and if the input string is not balanced, the method will not return a list of balanced strings. Add code to handle this case like so:
if (current_depth != 0) {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Input string does not have balanced parentheses");
}

Your truncateNumber method is not returning anything when the input number is negative. This is a problem because the method is declared to return a double, and if the input number is negative, the method will not return a double. Add code to handle this case like so:
if (number < 0) {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Input number must be positive");
}

Your factorize method does not handle the case where the input number is negative. This is a problem because the method is declared to return a list of integers, and if the input number is negative, the method will not return a list of integers. Add code to handle this case like so:
if (n < 0) {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Input number must be positive");
}

With these changes, your code should be working as expected.
