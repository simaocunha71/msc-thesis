I've reviewed the code you've posted and I'd like to offer some suggestions:

Naming: Your method names are descriptive, which is good. However, I noticed that the method name "nextSmallest" is a bit ambiguous. It might be more clear to name it "secondSmallest" or "secondSmallestElement".

Error Handling: In the "nextSmallest" method, you're assuming that the list will always contain at least two elements. However, the problem statement doesn't explicitly mention this. It would be better to handle the case where the list has fewer than two elements and return an appropriate value (e.g., Optional.empty()).

Optimization: In the "nextSmallest" method, you're iterating through the list twice: once to find the smallest element and once to find the second smallest element. This could be optimized by using a single pass through the list and keeping track of the smallest and second smallest elements as you go.

Here's an updated version of the "nextSmallest" method with these suggestions:

```java
public Optional<Integer> secondSmallest(List<Integer> lst) {
    if (lst.size() < 2) {
        return Optional.empty();
    }

    int smallest = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    int secondSmallest = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

    for (int num : lst) {
        if (num < smallest) {
            secondSmallest = smallest;
            smallest = num;
        } else if (num < secondSmallest && num > smallest) {
            secondSmallest = num;
        }
    }

    return secondSmallest == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? Optional.empty() : Optional.of(secondSmallest);
}
```

Overall, the code you've posted is well-structured and easy to understand. With these suggestions, it should be even better!
