Your code looks fine, but you may want to add a few comments to explain the logic behind the code. This will make it easier for others to understand your code. Also, you may want to consider using a switch statement instead of if-else statements in some cases for better readability. Finally, you may want to consider adding some error handling to handle invalid inputs. Overall, your code looks good and should work as expected.
