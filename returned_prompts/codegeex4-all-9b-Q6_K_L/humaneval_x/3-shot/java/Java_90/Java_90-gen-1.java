The Solution class has a constructor with no parameters. This is a common practice in Java, but it's not necessary in this case. Since the class doesn't have any static members or fields, we can remove the constructor altogether.
The Solution class has a main method. This method is not necessary and can be removed. The main method is typically used to test the functionality of a class, but in this case, we're only interested in the methods within the Solution class.
The Solution class has a hasCloseElements method. This method takes a List of Doubles and a double threshold as parameters. It checks if any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the threshold. The method uses a nested loop to iterate through all pairs of numbers in the list and calculates the absolute difference between each pair. If the difference is less than the threshold, the method returns true. If no such pair is found, the method returns false.
The Solution class has a separateParenGroups method. This method takes a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses as a parameter. It separates the groups into separate strings and returns a List of those strings. The method uses a StringBuilder to build the current group of parentheses, and it keeps track of the current depth of parentheses using an integer variable. It iterates through each character in the input string and updates the current group and depth accordingly. When a group is completed (i.e., the current depth is 0), the group is added to the result list and the StringBuilder is reset. Finally, the method returns the result list.
The Solution class has a truncateNumber method. This method takes a positive floating point number as a parameter. It returns the decimal part of the number by taking the modulus of the number and 1.0. This effectively removes the integer part of the number and returns the decimal part.
The Solution class has a nextSmallest method. This method takes a List of Integers as a parameter. It
