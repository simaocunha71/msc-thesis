I don't have a problem with the code you have provided. It is correct and it works as expected. However, I have a few suggestions that might make your code more readable and efficient.

Use enhanced for loops whenever possible. Instead of using traditional for loops, you can use enhanced for loops to iterate over collections. This makes your code more readable and reduces the chances of making mistakes.

In the separateParenGroups method, you can use the StringBuilder class to build the current_string. This class is more efficient than using the + operator to concatenate strings.

In the truncateNumber method, you can use the Math.floor method to truncate the number. This method returns the largest integer less than or equal to the given number.

In the common method, you can use the Stream API to filter and sort the common elements. This makes your code more concise and readable.

Here is the updated code with the suggestions:

import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    /**
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.
    >>> hasCloseElements(Arrays.asList(1.0, 2.0, 3.0), 0.5)
    false
    >>> hasCloseElements(Arrays.asList(1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0), 0.3)
    true
     */
    public boolean hasCloseElements(List<Double> numbers, double threshold) {
        for (double num1 : numbers) {
            for (double num2 : numbers) {
                double distance = Math.abs(num1 - num2);
                if (distance < threshold) return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    /**
    Input to this function is a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses. Your goal is to
    separate those group into separate strings and return the list of those.
    Separate groups are balanced (each open brace is properly closed) and not nested within each other
    Ignore any spaces in the input string.
    >>> separateParenGroups("( ) (( )) (( )( ))")
    ["()", "(())", "(()())"]
     */
    public List<String> separateParenGroups(String paren_string) {
        List<String> result
