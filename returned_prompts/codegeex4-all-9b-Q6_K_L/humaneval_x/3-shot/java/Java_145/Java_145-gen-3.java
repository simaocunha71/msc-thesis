The Solution class should be named HasCloseElements, SeparateParenGroups, TruncateNumber and OrderByPoints respectively. The class name should convey the functionality of the class.
The hasCloseElements method uses the variable name distance instead of d which is a more common variable name for distances.
The hasCloseElements method uses two nested for loops which results in a time complexity of O(n^2). This can be improved to O(n) by using a HashSet to store the numbers and then iterating through the HashSet to check if any two numbers are closer than the threshold.
The separateParenGroups method uses the variable name current_string instead of current which is a more common variable name for strings.
The separateParenGroups method uses the variable name current_depth instead of depth which is a more common variable name for depths.
The separateParenGroups method uses the variable name current_string instead of current which is a more common variable name for strings.
The separateParenGroups method uses the variable name current_depth instead of depth which is a more common variable name for depths.
The separateParenGroups method uses the variable name current_string instead of current which is a more common variable name for strings.
