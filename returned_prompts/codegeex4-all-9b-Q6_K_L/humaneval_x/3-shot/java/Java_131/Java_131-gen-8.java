Your code looks good and is simple and effective, but there are some things to note:

In the first Q&A, you have a missing closing bracket for the first Q. I assume it is a typo.
In the first Q&A, you should consider checking if the list is empty before entering the loop, to avoid a possible IndexOutOfBoundsException.
In the second Q&A, you should consider checking if the input string is empty before entering the loop, to avoid a possible IndexOutOfBoundsException.
In the second Q&A, you should consider checking if the input string contains only spaces, to avoid a possible EmptyStackException.
In the third Q&A, you should consider checking if the input number is a negative integer, to avoid a possible ArithmeticException.
In the third Q&A, you should consider checking if the input number is a decimal, to avoid a possible ArithmeticException.
In the fourth Q&A, you should consider checking if the input number is a negative integer, to avoid a possible ArithmeticException.
