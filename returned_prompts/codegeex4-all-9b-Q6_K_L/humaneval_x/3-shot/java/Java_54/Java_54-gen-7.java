1. For the first question, you are using a nested for loop to compare every pair of numbers. This is not the most efficient way to solve this problem. You can sort the list first, and then only compare adjacent numbers. This way, you only need to make one pass through the list, and the time complexity will be O(n log n).

2. For the second question, you are using a StringBuilder to build the current string and a variable to keep track of the current depth. This is a good approach, but you can simplify it by using a stack to keep track of the parentheses. When you encounter a '(', you push it onto the stack. When you encounter a ')', you pop the stack and check if the stack is empty. If it is, you add the current string to the result list and reset the current string.

3. For the third question, you are using the modulo operator to truncate the number. This is a good approach, but you can simplify it by using the Math.floor method. This way, you don't need to convert the number to a double.

4. For the fourth question, you are using a HashSet to store the characters in the first string, and then checking if each character in the second string
