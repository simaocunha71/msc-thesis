hasCloseElements
The for loop is inefficient and the code could be simplified.
The code also assumes that the threshold is positive, but the problem statement does not say that.

import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    /**
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.
    >>> hasCloseElements(Arrays.asList(1.0, 2.0, 3.0), 0.5)
    false
    >>> hasCloseElements(Arrays.asList(1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0), 0.3)
    true
     */
    public boolean hasCloseElements(List<Double> numbers, double threshold) {
        // This assumes threshold is positive, but the problem statement does not say that
        if (threshold <= 0.0) {
            return false;
        }
        // Sort the numbers to make it easier to find the closest pair
        Collections.sort(numbers);
        // Iterate over the sorted numbers
        for (int i = 1; i < numbers.size(); i++) {
            // Check if the difference between this number and the previous one is less than the threshold
            if (numbers.get(i) - numbers.get(i - 1) < threshold) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}

separateParenGroups
This is fine. The code is clear and easy to understand.

truncateNumber
The code is fine, but the problem statement does not say that the input number must be positive. It could be negative or a NaN or an infinite number.

getClosestVowel
The code is fine, but it could be simplified. The code also does not handle the case where the input string contains non-alphabet characters.
