There's a lot of good stuff here, but there's a few things that could be improved.

hasCloseElements:

You have a lot of magic numbers in your code. You can replace them with named constants. For example, you can define a constant for the size of the list, and use that instead of the magic number 2. This makes the code easier to understand, and if you ever need to change the size of the list, you only have to change it in one place.
You can also use a more descriptive variable name for the distance variable. For example, you could call it distanceBetweenNumbers.
You can also use a more descriptive variable name for the threshold variable. For example, you could call it minDistance.
Finally, you can also use a more descriptive variable name for the result variable. For example, you could call it hasCloseNumbers.

Here's how you can rewrite the code:

import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;
