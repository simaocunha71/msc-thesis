You have a few good things going on here:

You're using modern Java features like List and StringBuilder, which are good choices for the tasks you've described.
Your methods are short and simple, which is good for readability and maintenance.

However, there are a few things that could be improved:

You're using the name "A:" to indicate the start of the code. This is not a standard convention and can be confusing. Instead, you could use comments to explain what each part of the code is doing.
You're not using any comments to explain what the methods are supposed to do. This can make it difficult for someone else to understand your code. You should add comments to explain the purpose of each method and what it's supposed to do.
You're using a for loop to iterate through the list of numbers and compare each pair. This is fine, but you could make it more efficient by using a HashSet to store the numbers and then checking if the complement of each number (i.e., the number that would make the sum equal to the threshold) is in the set. This would reduce the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n).
You're using a for loop to iterate through the string of parentheses and build the groups. This is fine, but you could make it more efficient by using a stack to keep track of the parentheses. This would reduce the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n).
You're using a for loop to iterate through the list of numbers and calculate the difference between each pair. This is fine, but you could make it more efficient by using a single loop and keeping track of the maximum and minimum values seen so far. This would reduce the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n).

Here's an updated version of your code with these improvements:

import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    /**
    Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.
    >>> hasCloseElements(Arrays.asList(1.0, 2.0, 3.0), 0.5)
    false
    >>> hasCloseElements(Arrays.asList(1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5
