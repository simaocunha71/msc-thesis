The first problem is easy to fix, you just need to replace the 'n' in the output string with the number of odd digits in the input string. The problem with the second problem is that the numbers in the input are represented as strings, so you need to convert them to integers before you can check if they are odd. The third problem is also easy to fix, you just need to replace the 'n' in the output string with the number of odd digits in the input string. The problem with the fourth problem is that the input is a list of strings, so you need to convert them to integers before you can check if they are odd. The problem with the fifth problem is that the input is a list of strings, so you need to convert them to integers before you can check if they are odd. The problem with the sixth problem is that the input is a list of strings, so you need to convert them to integers before you can check if they are odd. The problem with the seventh problem is that the input is a list of strings, so you need to convert them to integers before you can check if they are odd. The problem with the eighth problem is that the input is a list of strings, so you need to convert them to integers before you can check if they are odd. The problem with the ninth problem is that the input is a list of strings, so you need to convert them to integers before you can check if they are odd. The problem with the tenth problem is that the input is a list of strings, so you need to convert them to integers before you can check if they are odd. The problem with the eleventh problem is that the input is a list of strings, so you need to convert them to integers before you can check if they are odd. The problem with the twelfth problem is that the input is a list of strings, so you need to convert them to integers before you can check if they are odd. The problem with
