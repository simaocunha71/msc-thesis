The Solution class in Java is a blueprint for creating objects. It can contain fields (also known as attributes or variables) and methods (also known as functions).
In your code, the Solution class has several methods that solve different problems. Let's go through each method and analyze it:

hasCloseElements(List<Double> numbers, double threshold):
This method takes a list of doubles and a threshold as input and checks if any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the given threshold. It returns a boolean value indicating the result.

The method uses a nested loop to compare each pair of numbers in the list. It calculates the absolute difference between each pair and checks if it is less than the threshold. If a pair of numbers is found that satisfies this condition, the method returns true. If no such pair is found, the method returns false.

separateParenGroups(String paren_string):
This method takes a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses and separates them into separate strings. It returns a list of these strings.

The method uses a StringBuilder to build the current string being processed and a variable to keep track of the current depth of parentheses. It iterates through each character in the input string and updates the current string and depth accordingly. When the current depth reaches zero, it means a group of parentheses has been fully processed, and the current string is added to the result list.

truncateNumber(double number):
This method takes a positive floating-point number as input and returns its decimal part. It does this by subtracting the integer part of the number from the original number.

pluck(List<Integer> arr):
This method takes a list of integers and returns the smallest even value from the list. If there are multiple occurrences of the smallest even value, it returns the one with the smallest index. If there are no even values or the list is empty, it returns an empty list.

The method iterates through the list and keeps track of the smallest even value and its index. If a smaller
