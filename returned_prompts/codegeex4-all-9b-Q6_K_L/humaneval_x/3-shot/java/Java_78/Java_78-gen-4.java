Your first question is pretty straight-forward. You're iterating through a list of doubles and for each double you're iterating through the rest of the list and checking if the absolute value of the difference between the two doubles is less than the threshold. If it is, you return true. If you get to the end of the list without finding two numbers closer to each other than the threshold, you return false.
Your second question is a bit more complicated. You're iterating through a string of parentheses and keeping track of the current depth of nested parentheses. When you encounter an opening parenthesis, you increase the depth and add it to the current string. When you encounter a closing parenthesis, you decrease the depth and add it to the current string. If the depth reaches zero, you add the current string to the result list and reset the current string. At the end of the string, you return the result list.
Your third question is also pretty straight-forward. You're using the modulo operator to find the decimal part of a number. The modulo operator returns the remainder of a division operation. In this case, you're dividing the number by 1.0, which is always 1, so the remainder is the decimal part of the number.
Your fourth question is a bit more complicated. You're iterating through a string of hexadecimal digits and counting the number of digits that are prime. You're using a HashSet to store the prime digits, and for each digit in the string, you're checking if it's in the HashSet. If it is, you increment the result counter. At the end of the string, you return the result counter.
