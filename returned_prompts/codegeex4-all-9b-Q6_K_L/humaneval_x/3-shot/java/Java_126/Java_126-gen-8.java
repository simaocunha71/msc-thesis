public boolean hasCloseElements(List<Double> numbers, double threshold) {
    for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < numbers.size(); j++) {
            double distance = Math.abs(numbers.get(i) - numbers.get(j));
            if (distance < threshold) return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}

This is a solution that works. It goes through each pair of numbers in the list and calculates the absolute distance between them. If any of those distances is less than the given threshold, it returns true. If none of the distances are less than the threshold, it returns false.
There are a few things that could be improved here:

The name "hasCloseElements" is not very descriptive. A better name could be "areAnyTwoNumbersCloserThanThreshold".
The code could be made more efficient by breaking out of the loop as soon as a close pair is found. This would reduce the number of unnecessary comparisons.
The code could be made more readable by using a more descriptive variable name for the distance between the two numbers.
The code could be made more concise by using a for-each loop instead of a traditional for loop.

Here is a revised version of the code with these improvements:

public boolean areAnyTwoNumbersCloserThanThreshold(List<Double> numbers, double threshold) {
    for (double num1 : numbers) {
        for (double num2 : numbers) {
            if (num1 != num2 && Math.abs(num1 - num2) < threshold) {
                return true;
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}

public List<String> separateParenGroups(String paren_string) {
    List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
    StringBuilder current_string = new StringBuilder();
    int current_depth = 0;

    for (char c : paren_string.toCharArray()) {
        if (c == '(') {
            current_depth += 1;
            current_string.append(c);
        } else if (c == ')') {
            current_depth -= 1;
            current_string.append(c);

            if (current_depth == 0) {
                result.add(current_string.toString());
                current_string.setLength(0);
            }
        }
    }
