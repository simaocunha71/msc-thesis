hasCloseElements
The function hasCloseElements takes in an array of numbers and a threshold. It iterates through the array, comparing each pair of numbers. If the absolute difference between two numbers is less than the threshold, it returns true. If no such pair is found, it returns false. However, the function currently has a time complexity of O(n^2), which can be improved to O(n log n) by sorting the array first.
separateParenGroups
The function separateParenGroups takes in a string of parentheses. It iterates through the string, keeping track of the current depth and the current group of parentheses. If the current depth is zero, it adds the current group to the result and resets the current group. The function returns the list of groups. However, the function does not handle cases where the parentheses are not properly balanced or nested.
truncateNumber
The function truncateNumber takes in a positive floating point number. It returns the decimal part of the number by subtracting the integer part from the original number. The function can be simplified to return number - Math.floor(number).
sortArray
The function sortArray takes in an array of non-negative integers. It sorts the array based on the number of ones in their binary representation in ascending order. If two numbers have the same number of ones, it sorts based on their decimal value. The function currently has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested sort calls. It can be improved to O(n log n) by using a custom comparator function that compares the number of ones first and then the decimal value.
