The code is correct but it has an O(n^2) time complexity. You can improve it using a single loop with a sorted list. This will reduce the time complexity to O(n log n). Here is the improved code:

const hasCloseElements = (numbers, threshold) => {
  numbers.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length - 1; i++) {
    if (numbers[i + 1] - numbers[i] < threshold) {
      return true;
    }
  }
  return false;
}

/* Input to this function is a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses. Your goal is to
  separate those group into separate strings and return the list of those.
  Separate groups are balanced (each open brace is properly closed) and not nested within each other
  Ignore any spaces in the input string.
  >>> separateParenGroups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))')
  ['()', '(())', '(()())']
  */
const separateParenGroups = (paren_string) => {

  var result = [];
  var current_string = [];
