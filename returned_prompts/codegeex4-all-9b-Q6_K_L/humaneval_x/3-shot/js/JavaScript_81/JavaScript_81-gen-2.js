The hasCloseElements function is correct. It checks all pairs of numbers to see if they are closer to each other than the given threshold. If it finds any pair that satisfies the condition, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.
The separateParenGroups function is also correct. It iterates through the input string character by character. If it encounters an opening parenthesis, it increases the current depth by 1 and adds the parenthesis to the current string. If it encounters a closing parenthesis, it decreases the current depth by 1 and adds the parenthesis to the current string. If the current depth becomes 0, it means that a balanced group of parentheses has been encountered, so it adds the current string to the result array and resets the current string. Finally, it returns the result array.
The truncateNumber function is correct. It calculates the remainder of the number divided by 1.0 using the modulo operator (%) and returns the result.
The numericalLetterGrade function is correct.
