hasCloseElements
The outer loop should iterate over the array, and the inner loop should iterate from the next index until the end of the array. This will avoid unnecessary comparisons.
The function as it is will return true as soon as it finds two numbers within the threshold. However, it should return true as soon as it finds any such pair. This can be achieved by returning true in the inner loop, instead of false.

separateParenGroups
The function as it is will return an empty array if the input string is empty. This can be improved by returning an empty array when the depth is 0.
The function as it is will return an array of strings, but the strings will contain parentheses. This can be improved by removing the parentheses from the strings.
The function as it is will return an array of strings, but the strings will contain spaces. This can be improved by removing the spaces from the strings.

truncateNumber
The function as it is will return 0 when the input number is 0. This can be improved by returning 0 when the input number is 0.

isPalindrome
The function as it is will return false when the input string is an empty string. This can be improved by returning true when the input string is an empty string.
The function as it is will return false when the input string contains spaces. This can be improved by removing the spaces from the string before checking for palindromicity.
The function as it is will return false when the input string contains case-sensitive characters. This can be improved by converting the input string to lower case before checking for palindromicity.

makePalindrome
The function as it is will return an empty string when the input string is an empty string. This can be
