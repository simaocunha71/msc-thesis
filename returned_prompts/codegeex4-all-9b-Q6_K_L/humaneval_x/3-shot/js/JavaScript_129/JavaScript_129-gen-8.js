You are getting the error because you are trying to call a function (getNeighbors) that is defined inside another function (dfs). The scope of the function is limited to the function where it is defined. So, when you try to call it from outside, it is not recognized. You can fix this error by moving the getNeighbors function outside dfs, like so:
const minPath = (grid, k) => {

  let N = grid.length;
  let visited = Array.from({ length: N }, () => Array(N).fill(false));
  let minPath = [];

  const getNeighbors = (i, j) => {
    let neighbors = [];
    if (i > 0) neighbors.push([i - 1, j]);
    if (i < N - 1) neighbors.push([i + 1, j]);
    if (j > 0) neighbors.push([i, j - 1]);
    if (j < N -
