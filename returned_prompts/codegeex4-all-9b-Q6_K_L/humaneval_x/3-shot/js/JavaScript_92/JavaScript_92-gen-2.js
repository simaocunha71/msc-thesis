Your solution for the first problem is correct. You iterate over the list of numbers twice, checking the distance between every two pairs of numbers. If the distance is less than the threshold, you return true immediately, otherwise you return false when you've checked all pairs.

Your solution for the second problem is correct. You iterate over each character in the string. If you find an opening parenthesis, you increase the depth and add the character to the current string. If you find a closing parenthesis, you decrease the depth and add the character to the current string. If the depth goes back to zero, it means you've closed all open parentheses and you can add the current string to the result. Finally, you return the result.

Your solution for the third problem is correct. You use the modulo operator to get the decimal part of the number. The result of the modulo operation is always smaller than 1, so it's the decimal part of the number.

Your solution for the fourth problem is correct. You use the Number.isInteger() function to check if all three numbers are integers. Then you use the condition operator to check if any of the three numbers is equal to the sum of the other two. If all conditions are met, you return true, otherwise you return false.
