The error you are getting is because your function is not returning anything. The problem is that your condition to stop the loop is wrong. You should stop the loop when the current depth is zero, not when it's one. Here is the corrected code:

const hasCloseElements = (numbers, threshold) => {
  for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < numbers.length; j++) {
      if (i != j) {
        let distance = Math.abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]);
        if (distance < threshold) {
          return true;
        }
      }
    }
  }
  return false;
}
