This function checks if there are any two numbers in the given list that are closer to each other than the given threshold. It does this by comparing each number to every other number in the list, and if it finds any two numbers that are closer than the threshold, it returns true. If it doesn't find any such pair, it returns false.

/* Input to this function is a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses. Your goal is to
  separate those group into separate strings and return the list of those.
  Separate groups are balanced (each open brace is properly closed) and not nested within each other
  Ignore any spaces in the input string.
