The first one is correct. It checks every pair of elements in the array and if the distance between them is smaller than the threshold, it returns true. If no pairs are found, it returns false.
The second one has a bug. It does not handle the case where the parentheses are not balanced. For example, if the input is '( ) (( )) (( )( )', it will return ['()', '(())', '(()())', '( )'], which is incorrect. The correct output should be ['()', '(())', '(()())']. To fix this, you can add a check to make sure the current depth is not negative before adding the current string to the result.
The third one is correct. It uses the modulus operator to calculate the decimal part of the number.
The fourth one is correct. It encrypts the input string by shifting the letters in the alphabet by two places. It handles non-alphabetic characters by leaving them as they are.
Overall, the code is correct and well-structured. It is easy to read and understand. However, there is a minor issue in the second one, which can be fixed by adding a check to make sure the current depth is not negative before adding the current string to the result.
