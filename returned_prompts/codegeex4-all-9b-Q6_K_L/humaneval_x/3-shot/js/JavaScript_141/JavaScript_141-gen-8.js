Your hasCloseElements function is O(n^2), which is not efficient for large input sizes. It can be optimized to O(n) by using a set to track the differences between the current number and the previous numbers. If the difference is less than the threshold, then return true. If we get through all the numbers without finding a close pair, then return false.

const hasCloseElements = (numbers, threshold) => {
  const seen = new Set();
  for (let num of numbers) {
    for (let seenNum of seen) {
      if (Math.abs(num - seenNum) < threshold) {
        return true;
      }
    }
    seen.add(num);
  }
  return false;
};

Your separateParenGroups function is correct, but it could be optimized by using a stack to keep track of the current depth of parentheses. This way, we can avoid using the current_depth variable and the corresponding if statement.

const separateParenGroups = (paren_string) => {
  const result = [];
  const stack = [];
  let current_string = '';

  for (const c of paren_string) {
    if (c == '(') {
      stack.push(c);
      current_string += c;
    } else if (c == ')') {
      stack.pop();
      current_string += c;
      if (stack.length == 0) {
        result.push(current_string);
        current_string = '';
      }
    }
  }

  return result;
};

Your truncateNumber function is correct, but it could be optimized by using the built-in Math.trunc function.

const truncateNumber = (number) => {
  return Math.trunc(number);
};

Your fileNameCheck function is correct, but it could be optimized by using regular expressions to check the file name's format.

const fileNameCheck = (file_name) => {
  const regex = /^[a-zA-Z]\d{0,3}\.(
