hasCloseElements

The main issue here is that you are checking every pair of numbers twice. Once where the first number is greater than the second and once where the second number is greater than the first. This can be resolved by only checking each pair once, or by checking both at the same time.

const hasCloseElements = (numbers, threshold) => {
  for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    for (let j = i + 1; j < numbers.length; j++) {
      let distance = Math.abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]);
      if (distance < threshold) {
        return true;
      }
    }
  }
  return false;
}

separateParenGroups

The main issue here is that you are not correctly tracking the current depth. If you encounter an open parenthesis, you should increment the depth, and if you encounter a close parenthesis, you should decrement the depth. However, you are not decrementing the depth when you encounter a close parenthesis, which can cause your program to return an incorrect result.

const separateParenGroups = (paren_string) => {
  var result = [];
  var current_string = [];
  var current_depth = 0;

  for (const c of paren_string) {
    if (c == '(') {
      current_depth += 1;
      current_string.push(c);
    } else if (c == ')') {
      current_depth -= 1;
      current_string.push(c);
      if (current_depth == 0) {
        result.push(current_string.join(''));
        current_string = [];
      }
    }
  }

  return result;
}

truncateNumber

This is a straightforward function. However, you could simplify it by using the built-in Math.trunc function.

const truncateNumber = (number) => {
  return number % 1.0;
}

getClosestVowel

The main issue here is that you are not correctly checking if a character is a vowel. You are checking if the character is in the string 'AEIOU', but this will not work for lowercase vowels. You can fix this
