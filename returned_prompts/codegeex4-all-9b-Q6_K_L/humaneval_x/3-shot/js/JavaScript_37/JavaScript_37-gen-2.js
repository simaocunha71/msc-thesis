The hasCloseElements function is correct. It checks all pairs of numbers to see if they are within the threshold of each other.

The separateParenGroups function is correct. It iterates through the input string and keeps track of the current depth of parentheses. When it reaches a depth of 0, it adds the current string to the result and resets it.

The truncateNumber function is correct. It uses the modulo operator to get the decimal part of the number.

The sortEven function is correct. It splits the input list into even and odd values, sorts the even values, and then inserts them into the odd values at the correct indices.
