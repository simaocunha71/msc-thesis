for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < numbers.length; j++) {
      if (i != j) {
        let distance = Math.abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]);

This solution is correct, but it can be optimized. The inner loop can be reduced to (j = i + 1; j < numbers.length; j++) to avoid checking the same pair of numbers twice. Also, the outer loop can be reduced to (i = 0; i < numbers.length - 1; i++) to avoid checking the same pair of numbers twice.

var result = [];
  var current_string = [];
  var current_depth = 0;

  for (const c of paren_string) {
    if (c == '(') {
      current_depth += 1;
      current_string.push(c);
    } else if (c == ')') {
      current_depth -= 1;
      current_string.push(c);
      if (current_depth == 0) {
        result.push(current_string.join(''));
        current_string = [];
      }
    }
  }

  return result;

This solution is correct, but it can be optimized by using a stack to keep track of the current depth of parentheses. When a closing parenthesis is encountered, the stack is popped until the opening parenthesis is found.

return number % 1.0;

This solution is correct, but it can be optimized by using the built-in function Math.trunc() instead of the remainder operator %.

return n * (n - 1) / 2;

This solution is correct, but it can be optimized by using the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers: n * (n - 1) / 2. This formula is more efficient than using a loop to calculate the sum.
