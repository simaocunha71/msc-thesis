The first function hasCloseElements is a little bit tricky. You should not check all pairs of numbers. You can check only pairs of numbers where i is smaller than j and i+1 is smaller than j. This is because if i is greater than j, then i+1 will be greater than j. This way you will check all pairs of numbers only once.
The second function separateParenGroups is good. You can improve it by using a while loop instead of a for loop and by checking if the current depth is not equal to 0 at the end of the loop.
The third function truncateNumber is good. You can improve it by using the Math.trunc function instead of the modulo operator.
The fourth function sumSquares is good. You can improve it by using a for loop instead of a while loop and by checking if the index is a multiple of 3 or 4 and not a multiple of 3 at the end of the loop.
