I'm a student learning JavaScript, and I've been working on some exercises that involve checking if two numbers are close to each other, separating groups of parentheses, truncating a number, counting prime numbers, and checking for prime numbers. Can you review my code and provide feedback on the quality and correctness of each solution? Additionally, if you have any recommendations for improving my understanding of these concepts, I would greatly appreciate it.
