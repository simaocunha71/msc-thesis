The first question is asking to check whether there are any two numbers in the list that are closer than the given threshold. If there are, return true, otherwise return false.
The second question is asking to separate the groups of parentheses in the given string into separate strings. Each group is balanced and not nested within each other.
The third question is asking to truncate the given number and return the decimal part. This can be done by subtracting the integer part of the number from the original number.
The fourth question is asking to count the number of even and odd digits in the given integer. This can be done by converting the integer to a string and iterating over each character. If the character is even, increment the even count, otherwise increment the odd count.
