The first function is correct. It iterates through all pairs of numbers in the input list and checks if they are within the given threshold. If any pair is within the threshold, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.
The second function is also correct. It separates groups of parentheses in the input string by iterating through each character and checking if it is an opening or closing parenthesis. It keeps track of the current depth of parentheses and adds the current character to the current string. If the current depth becomes zero, it means a group of parentheses has been closed, so it adds the current string to the result list and resets the current string. Finally, it returns the result list.
The third function is correct. It calculates the decimal part of a number by subtracting the integer part from the original number. The integer part is obtained by using the modulus operator with 1.0.
The fourth function is correct. It converts a number to a given base by repeatedly dividing the number by the base and keeping track of the remainder. The remainder is added to the result string, and the number is updated by dividing it by the base. This process continues until the number becomes zero. Finally, the result string is reversed and returned.
