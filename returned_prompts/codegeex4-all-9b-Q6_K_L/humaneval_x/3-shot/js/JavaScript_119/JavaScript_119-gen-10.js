The first problem has a time complexity of O(n^2). You can solve this in linear time by using a set to keep track of the numbers you have seen so far. If you find a number that is closer than the threshold to a number you have seen before, return true. If you finish the loop without finding any such number, return false.
```javascript
const hasCloseElements = (numbers, threshold) => {
  const seen = new Set();
  for (const num of numbers) {
    for (const seenNum of seen) {
      if (Math.abs(num - seenNum) < threshold) {
        return true;
      }
    }
    seen.add(num);
  }
  return false;
};
```

The second problem is correct, but it has a time complexity of O(n^2) because you are using nested loops. You can solve this in linear time by using a stack to keep track of the parentheses. Push an open parenthesis onto the stack, and pop it off when you see a close parenthesis. If the stack is empty when you see a close parenthesis, return 'No'. If you finish the loop without the stack being empty, return 'No'. Otherwise, return 'Yes'.
```javascript
const separateParenGroups = (paren_string) => {
  const stack = [];
  const result = [];
  let current_string = [];

  for (const c of paren_string) {
    if (c === '(') {
      stack.push(c);
      current_string.push(c);
    } else if (c === ')') {
      if (stack.length === 0) {
        return 'No';
      }
      stack.pop();
      current_string.push(c);
      if (stack.length === 0) {
        result.push(current_string.join(''));
        current_string = [];
      }
    }
  }

  return result;
};
```

The third problem is correct, but it can be simplified by using the built-in `toFixed` method of numbers. This method rounds
