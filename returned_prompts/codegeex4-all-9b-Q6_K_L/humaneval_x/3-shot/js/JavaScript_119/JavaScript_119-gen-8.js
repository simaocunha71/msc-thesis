The first solution is correct. It checks for every number in the array if there is a second number with a difference smaller than the threshold. This will work for any array of numbers, no matter the order.
The second solution is also correct. It goes through the input string and checks if every opening parenthesis has a matching closing parenthesis. It keeps track of the current depth of parentheses, and if it ever goes below zero, it means there are more closing parentheses than opening ones, so the string is not balanced. If the depth is zero at the end, it means all parentheses are balanced.
The third solution is correct. It uses the modulo operator to find the decimal part of the number. This will work for any positive floating point number.
The fourth solution is correct. It checks if the total number of parentheses in the two strings is equal, and if the total number of opening parentheses in the two strings is also equal. If both of these conditions are true, it means the two strings can be concatenated in some order to form a balanced string.
