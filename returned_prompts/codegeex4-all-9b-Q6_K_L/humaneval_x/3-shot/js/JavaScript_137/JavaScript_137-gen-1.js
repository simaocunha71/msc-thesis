Q1. 
What are the differences between the correct answers and my answers?
Answer: The correct answer is more efficient and concise. It uses a while loop to iterate through the string, keeping track of the current depth of parentheses. When the depth reaches 0, it means a group of parentheses has been fully closed, and it is added to the result array.
Time complexity: The time complexity of the correct answer is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because it iterates through the string once.
How can I improve my answers?
Answer: My answer is correct, but it is more verbose and less efficient. It uses nested for loops to compare each pair of numbers, which results in a time complexity of O(n^2). Additionally, it does not handle corner cases such as multiple groups of parentheses being separated by spaces.
Corner cases: The corner cases for this problem include:
1. Empty string: The function should return an empty array.
2. Single group of parentheses: The function should return an array containing a single string.
3. Group of parentheses with spaces: The function should ignore the spaces and return the correct group of parentheses.
