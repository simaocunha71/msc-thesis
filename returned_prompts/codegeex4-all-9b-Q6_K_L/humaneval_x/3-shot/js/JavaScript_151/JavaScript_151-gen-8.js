Your first code is correct. It checks each pair of elements in the array for the distance between them, and returns true if any pair is within the specified threshold.
Your second code is almost correct. The only issue is that it doesn't handle the case where the parentheses string is empty. You should add a check for this at the beginning of the function.
Your third code is correct. It uses the modulus operator to find the decimal part of the number.
Your fourth code is correct. It iterates through the list of numbers, and adds the square of each odd number to the sum. It ignores negative numbers and non-integers.
Overall, your code is correct and efficient, and you've done a good job of explaining what each part does.
