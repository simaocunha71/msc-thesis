HasCloseElements is correct.

SeparateParenGroups has an off-by-one error, which could cause the last group to not be added to the result.

TruncateNumber is correct.

SameChars is not correct. It will fail if the words have different lengths or if the characters are in different orders. It should use a map to count the occurrences of each character in both strings, and then compare the maps.

Here is the corrected version of SameChars:
func SameChars(s0 string, s1 string) bool {
    if len(s0) != len(s1) {
        return false
    }
    count0 := make(map[rune]int)
    count1 := make(map[rune]int)
    for i, c := range s0 {
        count0[c]++
        count1[rune(s1[i])]++
    }
    for c := range count0 {
        if count0[c] != count1[c] {
            return false
        }
    }
    return true
}
