First, I would like to note that there is no need for the type conversion in the last line of the TruncateNumber function. Since we are using the math.Mod function to calculate the remainder of the division, the result will be a float64. Therefore, we can simply return the result directly.
Here is the updated function:
func TruncateNumber(number float64) float64 {
    return math.Mod(number, 1)
}

In the SeparateParenGroups function, you are using the += operator to increment the current_depth variable, which is not necessary. You can simply use the ++ operator to increment the variable. Additionally, you don't need to use the make function to create a new slice. You can simply use the append function to add elements to the slice. Here is the updated function:
func SeparateParenGroups(paren_string string) []string {
    result := []string{}
    current_string := []rune{}
    current_depth := 0

    for _, c := range paren_string {
        if c == '(' {
            current_depth++
            current_string = append(current_string, c)
        } else if c == ')' {
            current_depth--
            current_string = append(current_string, c)

            if current_depth == 0 {
                result = append(result, string(current_string))
                current_string = []rune{}
            }
        }
    }
    return result
}

In the SortThird function, you are using the third variable to determine the start index of the third elements in the list. However, since the length of the list is not necessarily a multiple of three, you need to use the modulo operator to calculate the start index. Here is the updated function:
func SortThird(l []int) []int {
    third := len(l) % 3

    third_list := make([]int, 0)

    for i := third; i < len(l); i += 3 {
        third_list = append(third_list, l[i])
    }

    sort.Ints
