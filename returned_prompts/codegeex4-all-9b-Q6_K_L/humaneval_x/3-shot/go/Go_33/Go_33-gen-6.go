I have some minor comments for you:

In the second question, your code is correct, but you can make it more efficient by using a flag that checks if current depth is zero instead of checking it inside if condition.
In the last question, you can use the built-in package "sort" which has a function called "IntsAreSorted" that checks if a slice is sorted. This can be used to reduce your code complexity and make it more readable.
