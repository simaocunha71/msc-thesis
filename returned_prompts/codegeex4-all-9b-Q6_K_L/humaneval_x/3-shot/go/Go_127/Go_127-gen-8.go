    for i := 0; i < len(numbers); i++ {
        for j := i + 1; j < len(numbers); j++ {
            var distance float64 = math.Abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j])
            if distance < threshold {
                return true
            }
        }
    }
    return false
}

This function is correct and efficient, it has a time complexity of O(n^2) which is acceptable for this problem since the input size is small.
