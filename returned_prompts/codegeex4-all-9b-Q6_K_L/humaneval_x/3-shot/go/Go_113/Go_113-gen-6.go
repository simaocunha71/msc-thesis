There is a very simple way to solve the problem of separating groups of parentheses in a string in a single pass. All you need to do is to track the depth of the parentheses while iterating over the string. When the depth of parentheses reaches 0 again, you know that you have reached the end of a group. Here is the updated code:

func SeparateParenGroups(paren_string string) []string {
    result := make([]string, 0)
    current_string := make([]rune, 0)
    depth := 0

    for _, c := range paren_string {
        if c == '(' {
            depth += 1
            current_string = append(current_string, c)
        } else if c == ')' {
            depth -= 1
            current_string = append(current_string, c)
            if depth == 0 {
                result = append(result, string(current_string))
                current_string = make([]rune, 0)
            }
        }
    }
    return result
}

Now, let's take a look at the solution for the "TruncateNumber" problem. The problem is to find the decimal part of a given floating point number. The solution is to use the built-in "math.Mod" function which calculates the remainder of a division. In this case, we want to find the remainder of the division of the given number by 1, which will give us the decimal part of the number. Here is the updated code:

func TruncateNumber(number float64) float64 {
    return math.Mod(number, 1)
}

Finally, let's take a look at the solution for the "OddCount" problem. The problem is to count the number of odd digits in each string of a given list of strings. The solution is to iterate over each string in the list, count the number of odd digits in each string, and then create a new string using the count as a placeholder. Here is the updated code:

func OddCount(lst []string) []string {
    result := make([]
