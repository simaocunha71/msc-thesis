You've got a few good questions here, but you've also got a few issues in your code. I'll start by addressing the code, then move on to the questions:

In HasCloseElements, you're using a variable named distance, but it would be more idiomatic to name it diff instead.
In SeparateParenGroups, you're using the rune type instead of the byte type. This is fine, but it's not the most common practice. The byte type is generally preferred in Go for handling ASCII strings.
In TruncateNumber, your function name is a bit unclear. I would recommend renaming it to something like truncateDecimal or truncateFraction instead.
In IncrList, your function is modifying the input slice in place. This is fine, but it's not the most idiomatic way to do it. Instead, you could create a new slice and return that, like so:

```go
func IncrList(l []int) []int {
    result := make([]int, len(l))
    for i, v := range l {
        result[i] = v + 1
    }
    return result
}
```

Now, let's address the questions:
