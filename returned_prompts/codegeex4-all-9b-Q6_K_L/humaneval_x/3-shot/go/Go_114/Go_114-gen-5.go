Q1: You have a simple problem here. You need to check if there are two numbers that are within the given threshold. The current code you have is fine, but you can simplify it a bit. You can use a single loop and compare each pair of numbers. Here's the updated code:

```
func HasCloseElements(numbers []float64, threshold float64) bool {
    for i := 0; i < len(numbers)-1; i++ {
        for j := i + 1; j < len(numbers); j++ {
            if math.Abs(numbers[i]-numbers[j]) < threshold {
                return true
            }
        }
    }
    return false
}
```

Q2: You have a good start, but you're not handling the spaces in the input string. You can use the strings package to remove all spaces from the input string. Here's the updated code:

```
import (
    "strings"
)

func SeparateParenGroups(paren_string string) []string {
    paren_string = strings.ReplaceAll(paren_string, " ", "")
    result := make([]string, 0)
    current_string := make([]rune, 0)
    current_depth := 0

    for _, c := range paren_string {
        if c == '(' {
            current_depth += 1
            current_string = append(current_string, c)
        } else if c == ')' {
            current_depth -= 1
            current_string = append(current_string, c)

            if current_depth == 0 {
                result = append(result, string(current_string))
                current_string = make([]rune, 0)
            }
        }
    }
    return result
}
```

Q3: You're using the math package correctly, but you can simplify the code a bit. You don't need to use math.Mod. You can use the built-in % operator to get the remainder of the division. Here's the updated code:

```
func TruncateNumber(number float64) float64 {
    return number - math.Trunc(number)
}
```

Q4: Your code is mostly correct, but you're not handling the case where the sum becomes positive again after
