You can write a function to check if two numbers are closer than a given threshold.
Here is a sample implementation in Go:
```go
import (
    "math"
)

// Check if two numbers are closer than a given threshold
func AreClose(a, b, threshold float64) bool {
    distance := math.Abs(a - b)
    return distance < threshold
}
```
You can use this function in your HasCloseElements function:
```go
func HasCloseElements(numbers []float64, threshold float64) bool {
    for i := 0; i < len(numbers); i++ {
        for j := i + 1; j < len(numbers); j++ {
            if AreClose(numbers[i], numbers[j], threshold) {
                return true
            }
        }
    }
    return false
}
```
The SeparateParenGroups function looks like it's working correctly. It correctly separates groups of parentheses into separate strings.
The TruncateNumber function looks like it's working correctly. It correctly truncates a floating point number to its decimal part.
The Concatenate function looks like it's working correctly. It correctly concatenates a list of strings into a single string.
