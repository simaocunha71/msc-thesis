Problem 1: HasCloseElements
The code looks good and efficient. But there's a minor improvement that can be made. You can use a single loop with a range that goes from 0 to len(numbers)-1 and use the current index and index+1 to calculate the distance. This will make the code cleaner and easier to read.

Problem 2: SeparateParenGroups
The code looks good and efficient. But there's a minor improvement that can be made. You can use a stack to keep track of the parentheses instead of using a depth variable. This will make the code cleaner and easier to read.

Problem 3: TruncateNumber
The code looks good and efficient. But there's a minor improvement that can be made. You can use math.Trunc instead of math.Mod to truncate the number. This will make the code cleaner and easier to read.

Problem 4: Concatenate
The code looks good and efficient. But there's a minor improvement that can be made. You can use strings.Join instead of using a loop to concatenate the strings. This will make the code cleaner and easier to read.
