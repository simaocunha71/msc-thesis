There are a few points to consider:

Your code is quite readable and understandable.
You are using the built-in sort.Slice function, which is a good approach because it's more idiomatic to use the sort package.
In the separateParenGroups function, you are using an integer to keep track of the current depth of parentheses. However, you should use a rune instead of an integer because the parentheses are characters, not integers.

Here are the changes I made to your code:

I replaced the current_depth variable with a current_string variable to keep track of the current string of parentheses.
I replaced the current_depth variable with a current_depth variable to keep track of the current depth of parentheses.
I replaced the current_depth variable with a current_depth variable to keep track of the current depth of parentheses.
