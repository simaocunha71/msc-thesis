Your solution for SeparateParenGroups is correct. You iterate over the string character by character. Whenever you encounter an open parenthesis, you increase the current depth. If the current depth equals zero and you encounter a closing parenthesis, you add the current string to the result and reset the current string. This works as expected.

Your solution for HasCloseElements is correct. You iterate over all pairs of numbers in the given list. If the difference between the current pair of numbers is smaller than the given threshold, you return true. If you reach the end of the list without finding two numbers that are closer than the threshold, you return false.

Your solution for TruncateNumber is correct. You use the math.Mod function to compute the remainder of the division of the given number by 1. This is the decimal part of the number.

Your solution for SortArray is correct. You use the sort.Slice function to sort the given slice of integers. You compare the numbers based on the number of ones in their binary representation and, for numbers with the same number of ones, based on their decimal value. You use the countOnes function to count the number of ones in the binary representation of a number.
