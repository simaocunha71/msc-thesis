This is a pretty good job for a beginner! You've written 4 functions that do the job as specified, and your code is generally clean, clear, and free of bugs.
However, there's a couple of things that can be improved:

In HasCloseElements, you're iterating over all pairs of numbers. This is fine, but you can make the code more efficient by breaking out of the inner loop as soon as you find a pair of numbers that are closer than the threshold. This would save you a lot of unnecessary iterations.
In SeparateParenGroups, your code is working correctly, but it's not very efficient. You're creating a new slice for each character in the input string, which is unnecessary. Instead, you could just use a single slice and append to it as needed. Also, you're using a rune slice to store the current string, which is not necessary. You could just use a byte slice instead.
In WillItFly, your code is working correctly, but it's not very efficient. You're using recursion to check if the list is balanced, which can be slow for large lists. Instead, you could use a loop to iterate over the list and check if it's balanced. Also, you're using recursion to check if the sum of the list is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight, which can also be slow for large lists. Instead, you could use a loop to iterate over the list and calculate the sum. Finally, you're using a ternary operator to check if the sum is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight, which is not necessary. You could just use an if statement instead.
In general, your code is well-structured and easy to read. However, you could make it more efficient by using loops instead of recursion, and by avoiding unnecessary allocations.

Here's a version of your code with some of these improvements:
