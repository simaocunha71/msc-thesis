You can use the following function to check if two numbers are closer than a given threshold:

```go
import (
    "math"
)

func HasCloseElements(numbers []float64, threshold float64) bool {
    for i := 0; i < len(numbers); i++ {
        for j := i + 1; j < len(numbers); j++ {
            if math.Abs(numbers[i]-numbers[j]) < threshold {
                return true
            }
        }
    }
    return false
}
```

This function iterates over each pair of numbers in the given list and checks if the absolute difference between them is smaller than the threshold. If it finds a pair that satisfies this condition, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

The time complexity of this function is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input list. This is because it uses a nested loop to compare each pair of numbers.

Here is an example usage of the function:

```go
numbers := []float64{1.0, 2.0, 3.0}
threshold := 0.5

result := HasCloseElements(numbers, threshold)
fmt.Println(result) // Output: false
```

In this example, there are no two numbers in the list that are closer than 0.5, so the function returns false.
