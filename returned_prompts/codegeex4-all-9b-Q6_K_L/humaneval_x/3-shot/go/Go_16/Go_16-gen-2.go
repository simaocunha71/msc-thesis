The first function is correct. You iterate over all pairs of numbers and check if their absolute difference is less than the threshold.

The second function has a few issues:

You are using rune instead of byte when iterating over the string. This is fine, but it is not necessary since the input is a string of bytes.
You are not checking for invalid characters. The function will panic if it encounters a character that is not a parenthesis or a space.
You are not ignoring spaces. You should skip them in the loop.
You are not checking if the current depth is less than 0. This can happen if there are more closing parentheses than opening ones.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

func SeparateParenGroups(paren_string string) []string {
    result := make([]string, 0)
    current_string := make([]byte, 0)
    current_depth := 0

    for _, c := range paren_string {
        if c == '(' {
            current_depth += 1
            current_string = append(current_string, c)
        } else if c == ')' {
            current_depth -= 1
            current_string = append(current_string, c)

            if current_depth == 0 {
                result = append(result, string(current_string))
                current_string = make([]byte, 0)
            }
        }
    }
    return result
}

The third function is correct.

The fourth function has a few issues:

You are using rune instead of byte when iterating over the string. This is fine, but it is not necessary since the input is a string of bytes.
You are not checking for invalid characters. The function will panic if it encounters a character that is not a letter.
You are not ignoring case. You should convert all characters to lowercase or uppercase before checking them.
You are not initializing the map with the correct type. The map should have keys of type byte and values of type bool.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

func CountDistinctCharacters(str string) int {
    distinct := make(map[byte]bool)
    for _, c := range str {
        if c >= 'a' && c <= 'z' || c >= 'A' && c <= 'Z' {
            distinct[byte(strings.ToLower(string(c)))] = true
        }
    }
    return len(distinct)
}
