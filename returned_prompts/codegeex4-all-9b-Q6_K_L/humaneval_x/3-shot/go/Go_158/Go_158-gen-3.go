HasCloseElements(numbers []float64, threshold float64) bool {

This function is a little bit confusing because of the way you have named the function parameters. I would suggest changing the parameter names to be more descriptive. For example, numbers could be renamed to values or numbers could be renamed to floats. The threshold could be renamed to delta or tolerance.

    for i := 0; i < len(numbers); i++ {
        for j := i + 1; j < len(numbers); j++ {
            var distance float64 = math.Abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j])
            if distance < threshold {
                return true
            }
        }
    }
    return false
}

This code is correct, but it can be optimized. You only need to check the numbers up to the index of the current number. This can be done by changing the inner loop to start at i + 1.

SeparateParenGroups(paren_string string) []string {

This function is correct, but it can be optimized. You can use a stack to keep track of the parentheses. When you encounter an opening parenthesis, you push it onto the stack. When you encounter a closing parenthesis, you pop the top of the stack and check if it matches. If it does not match, you return an error. If the stack is empty at the end, you return the groups.

TruncateNumber(number float64) float64 {

This function is correct, but it can be optimized. You can use the math.Trunc function instead of math.Mod.

FindMax(words []string) string {

This function is correct, but it can be optimized. You can use a map to keep track of the unique characters in each word. This can be done by iterating over the characters in the word and adding them to the map. If the map has the same number of elements as the word, you check if it is
