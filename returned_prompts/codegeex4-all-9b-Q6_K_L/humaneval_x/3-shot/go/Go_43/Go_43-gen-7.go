I'll give you some tips for the first problem:

You're on the right track! You just need to add a check for the case where numbers[i] == numbers[j]. The current code would return true for that case.
You're also on the right track for the second problem. The only thing I would add is a check for the case where the string is empty. This would prevent a panic.
For the third problem, you're on the right track. You just need to add a check for the case where the number is less than 1. This would prevent a panic.
For the fourth problem, you're on the right track. You just need to add a check for the case where the list is empty. This would prevent a panic.

Here's the code with the fixes:

```go
import (
    "math"
)

// Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.
// >>> HasCloseElements([]float64{1.0, 2.0, 3.0}, 0.5)
// false
// >>> HasCloseElements([]float64{1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0}, 0.3)
// true
func HasCloseElements(numbers []float64, threshold float64) bool {
    if len(numbers) < 2 {
        return false
    }
    for i := 0; i < len(numbers); i++ {
        for j := i + 1; j < len(numbers); j++ {
            var distance float64 = math.Abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j])
            if distance < threshold && numbers[i] != numbers[j] {
                return true
            }
        }
    }
    return false
}
```

```go
// Input to this function is a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses. Your goal is to
// separate those group into separate strings and return the list of those.
// Separate groups are balanced (each open brace is properly closed) and not nested within each other
// Ignore any spaces in the input string.
// >>> SeparateParenGroups('( ) ((
