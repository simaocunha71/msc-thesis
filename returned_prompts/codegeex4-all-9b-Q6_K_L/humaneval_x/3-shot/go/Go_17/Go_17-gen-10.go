This function looks mostly correct, but it could be made a bit more efficient. The current implementation has a time complexity of O(n^2), which is not necessary. You could instead sort the list of numbers and then iterate through it once, checking the distance between each pair of adjacent numbers. This would reduce the time complexity to O(n log n) due to the sorting step, and then O(n) due to the single pass, for a total of O(n log n).

// Input to this function is a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses. Your goal is to
// separate those group into separate strings and return the list of those.
// Separate groups are balanced (each open brace is properly closed) and not nested within each other
// Ignore any spaces in the input string.
// >>> SeparateParenGroups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))')
// ['()', '(())', '(()())']
