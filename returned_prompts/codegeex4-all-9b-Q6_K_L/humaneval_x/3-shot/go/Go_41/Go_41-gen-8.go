Your code for Q1 is correct. It iterates over the string and checks if the parentheses are balanced. If they are, it appends the string to the result slice and resets the current_string slice.

Your code for Q2 is almost correct, but you need to check if the depth is 0 before appending the current_string to the result slice. Otherwise, you will get an empty string in the result slice. Also, you need to return the result slice instead of the current_string slice.

Your code for Q3 is correct. It uses the math.Mod function to get the decimal part of the number.

Your code for Q4 is correct. It calculates the number of collisions by multiplying n with itself.
