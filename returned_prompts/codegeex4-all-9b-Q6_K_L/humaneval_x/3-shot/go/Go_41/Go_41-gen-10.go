For all of the problems, I don't see any issues, so your solutions are correct. 

In the first problem, you have a nested loop that checks all pairs of elements in the slice. If the absolute difference between any two elements is less than the threshold, you return true. If no such pair is found, you return false. This is the correct approach to solve the problem.

In the second problem, you iterate over each character in the input string. If the character is an open parenthesis, you increment the current depth and add the character to the current string. If the character is a closed parenthesis, you decrement the current depth and add the character to the current string. If the current depth reaches zero, it means you have found a complete group of parentheses, so you add the current string to the result slice and reset the current string. Finally, you return the result slice. This is the correct approach to solve the problem.

In the third problem, you use the math.Mod function to calculate the decimal part of the number. This function returns the remainder of the division of the number by 1, which is the decimal part. This is the correct approach to solve the problem.

In the fourth problem, you use a formula to calculate the number of collisions. The number of collisions is the square of the number of cars, because each car collides with every other car. This is a reasonable assumption, but it's important to note that this formula may not be correct for all possible scenarios. For example, if the cars are driving at different speeds, the number of collisions may be different. So, this formula should be used with caution.
