The first problem is in this piece of code:
for j := i + 1; j < len(numbers); j++ {
    var distance float64 = math.Abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j])
    if distance < threshold {
        return true
    }
}

The problem is that when j == len(numbers) the loop will not be executed. You need to add a condition to make sure that the loop will be executed when j == len(numbers). You can do this by using the following line of code:
for j := i + 1; j <= len(numbers); j++ {

The second problem is in this piece of code:
for _, c := range paren_string {
    if c == '(' {
        current_depth += 1
        current_string = append(current_string, c)
    }else if c== ')'{
        current_depth -= 1
        current_string = append(current_string, c)

        if current_depth == 0{
            result = append(result, string(current_string))
            current_string =  make([]rune, 0)
        }
    }
}

The problem is that when c == ')' the loop will not be executed. You need to add a condition to make sure that the loop will be executed when c == ')'. You can do this by using the following line of code:
for _, c := range paren_string {
    if c == '(' {
        current_depth += 1
        current_string = append(current_string, c)
    }else if c== ')'{
        current_depth -= 1
        current_string = append(current_string, c)

        if current_depth == 0{
            result = append(result, string(current_string))
            current_string =  make([]rune, 0
