Your question is incomplete. You've written the code for three questions, but you haven't asked any questions about them. I'll answer them one by one:

Q1:
Your function looks mostly correct. The only issue is that you're not returning anything if there are no two numbers closer than the threshold. You should return false in that case.

Q2:
Your function looks mostly correct, but there's a small issue. You're not checking if the current depth is zero before appending the current string to the result. This means that you'll end up appending an empty string to the result if the last group of parentheses is not closed. You should only append the current string to the result if the current depth is zero.

Q3:
Your function is not correct. The function signature says that the function takes three numbers, but you're not using any of them. The function should return true if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two, and all numbers are integers. Here's a corrected version:

func AnyInt(x, y, z interface{}) bool {
    // Convert the inputs to floats
    f1 := x.(float64)
    f2 := y.(float64)
    f3 := z.(float64)

    // Check if any of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two
    return (f1 == f2+f3 || f2 == f1+f3 || f3 == f1+f2) && f1 == float64(int(f1)) && f2 == float64(int(f2)) && f3 == float64(int(f3))
}

This function first converts the inputs to floats. Then it checks if any of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two. Finally, it checks if all numbers are integers. If all these conditions are met, the function returns true; otherwise, it returns false.
