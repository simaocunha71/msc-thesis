Firstly, I'd like to say that the quality of the code you're asking about is quite good. It's not perfect, but it's certainly reasonable. I'll try to point out areas for improvement, but keep in mind that there's no single "correct" way to write a function, and there are always trade-offs to consider. 

For the first function, HasCloseElements, you're iterating over pairs of numbers and checking if their absolute difference is smaller than the given threshold. This is a reasonable approach, but it could be optimized a bit. Instead of comparing every pair of numbers, you could sort the list and then only compare adjacent numbers. This would reduce the number of comparisons from n(n-1)/2 to n-1, which can be a significant improvement for large lists. Here's how you could do it:

```go
import (
    "sort"
)

func HasCloseElements(numbers []float64, threshold float64) bool {
    sort.Float64s(numbers)
    for i := 1; i < len(numbers); i++ {
        if numbers[i]-numbers[i-1] < threshold {
            return true
        }
    }
    return false
}
```

For the second function, SeparateParenGroups, you're iterating over the input string and keeping track of the current depth of parentheses. This is a good approach, but it could be made more efficient. Instead of using a slice of runes to store the current string, you could use a string builder. This would reduce the number of memory allocations and copying, which can be a significant improvement for large input strings. Here's how you could do it:

```go
import (
    "strings"
)

func SeparateParenGroups(paren_string string) []string {
    result := []string{}
    current_string := strings.Builder{}
    current_depth := 0

    for _, c := range paren_string {
        if c == '(' {
            current_depth += 1
