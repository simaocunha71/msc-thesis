The HasCloseElements function seems to be correct. It checks all possible pairs of numbers to see if their absolute difference is smaller than the given threshold.
The SeparateParenGroups function seems to be correct. It goes through each character in the input string and keeps track of the current depth of parentheses. When it encounters a closing parenthesis and the current depth is 0, it adds the current string to the result list and resets the current string.
The TruncateNumber function seems to be correct. It uses the math.Mod function to compute the decimal part of the given number.
The XOrY function seems to be correct. It checks if the given number is prime using the isPrime helper function. If it is prime, it returns the value of x; otherwise, it returns the value of y.
