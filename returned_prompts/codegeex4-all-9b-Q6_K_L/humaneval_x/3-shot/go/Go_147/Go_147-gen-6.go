SeparateParenGroups
Your implementation is fine, but it's not the most efficient. You're using a rune slice to build the strings. It would be better to build a []byte and convert to string at the end. You're also using string concatenation in the loop, which is slow. You can build a single string and then slice it to remove the extra characters at the end.

HasCloseElements
Your implementation is fine, but it's not the most efficient. You're checking every pair of numbers in the list. This means your algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2). There are better ways to do this, such as using a hash map to store the numbers and then checking if there's a number within the threshold of any given number.

TruncateNumber
Your implementation is fine, but it's not the most efficient. You're using the math.Mod function, which has a time complexity of O(1). However, you're also using the math.Abs function, which has a time complexity of O(1). This means your algorithm has a time complexity of O(1). However, you can use the math.Floor function, which has a time complexity of O(1). This means your algorithm has a time complexity of O(1).

GetMaxTriples
Your implementation is fine, but it's not the most efficient. You're checking every triple of numbers in the list. This means your algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^3). There are better ways to do this, such as using a hash map
