Your implementation of SeparateParenGroups() is correct. I see no obvious issues with it. However, it could be made more efficient by avoiding the append calls on every loop iteration. Instead, you could create a slice of runes of the appropriate size, and then append to that. However, since you're only ever appending a single rune, this won't make much of a difference in practice.
Your implementation of TruncateNumber() is also correct, as is DoubleTheDifference().
Your implementation of HasCloseElements() is incorrect. The inner loop should iterate over all elements, not just the elements after the current one. This means that the inner loop should start at index 0, not index i. However, you also don't need the inner loop. You can use the sort package to sort the slice of numbers, and then check if the difference between any two adjacent numbers is less than the threshold. This would be more efficient than your current implementation, and would also be more correct.
