The first question is pretty simple. It checks if there are any two numbers within the given threshold. It does this by iterating through the list of numbers and calculating the difference between each pair. If the difference is less than the threshold, it returns true.
The second question is a bit more complex. It takes a string of parentheses and separates them into individual strings. It does this by iterating through the string and counting the depth of the parentheses. When the depth is 0, it adds the current string to the result and resets the current string.
The third question is also a bit complex. It takes a floating point number and returns the decimal part. It does this by taking the modulus of the number and 1.
The last question is a bit tricky. It takes an array of integers and checks if the array can be arranged in a way that each element is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. It does this by iterating through the array and checking if the current element is less than the previous element. If it is, it returns the index of the previous element. If it gets to the end of the array without finding a single element that is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it, it returns -1.
