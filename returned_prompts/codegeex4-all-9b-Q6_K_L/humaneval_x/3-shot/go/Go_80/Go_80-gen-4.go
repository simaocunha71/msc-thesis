Here are some observations about your code:

In the HasCloseElements function, you iterate over all pairs of numbers and return true if you find a pair within the threshold. This is correct, but it could be more efficient if you use a map to store the numbers and check if the number within the threshold exists in the map.

In the SeparateParenGroups function, you iterate over all characters in the input string and keep track of the current depth of parentheses. This is correct, but you should use a more efficient data structure to store the current string, such as a string builder.

In the TruncateNumber function, you use the math.Mod function to get the decimal part of the number. This is correct, but you could also use the math.Floor function to get the integer part of the number.

In the IsHappy function, you iterate over all characters in the input string and check if there are any consecutive characters that are the same. This is correct, but you could also use a map to store the characters and check if the character exists in the map.

Here is an improved version of your code:

import (
    "math"
    "strings"
)

// Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.
// >>> HasCloseElements([]float64{1.0, 2.0, 3.0}, 0.5)
// false
// >>> HasCloseElements([]float64{1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0}, 0.3)
// true
func HasCloseElements(numbers []float64, threshold float64) bool {
    numberMap := make(map[float64]bool)
    for _, number := range numbers {
        for key := range numberMap {
            if math.Abs(number-key) < threshold {
                return true
            }
        }
        numberMap[number] = true
    }
    return false
}

// Input to this function is a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses. Your goal is to
// separate those group into
