Q1:
The function HasCloseElements checks if any two numbers in the given list are closer to each other than the given threshold. The function iterates over all pairs of numbers in the list and calculates the absolute difference between them. If the difference is smaller than the threshold, the function returns true. If no such pair is found, the function returns false.

Q2:
The function SeparateParenGroups takes a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses and separates them into separate strings. The function iterates over each character in the string. If the character is an opening parenthesis, the current depth is incremented and the character is added to the current string. If the character is a closing parenthesis, the current depth is decremented and the character is added to the current string. If the current depth reaches zero, the current string is added to the result list and the current string is reset. Finally, the function returns the result list.

Q3:
The function TruncateNumber takes a positive floating point number and returns its decimal part. The function uses the math.Mod function to calculate the remainder of the number when divided by 1. The decimal part is the remainder, which is always smaller than 1.

Q4:
The function SumSquares takes a list of integers and returns the sum of all entries. The function iterates over each entry in the list and squares it if its index is a multiple of 3. If the index is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3, the function cubes the entry. The function then adds the entry to the sum. Finally, the function returns the sum.
