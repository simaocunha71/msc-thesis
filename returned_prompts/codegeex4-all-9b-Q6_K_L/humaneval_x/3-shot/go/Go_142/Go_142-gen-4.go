Your answers are mostly correct, but there are a few issues. Here are the corrections:

In the HasCloseElements function, you need to check if the distance between two numbers is less than the threshold, not greater than or equal to it.

In the SeparateParenGroups function, you need to handle the case where there are spaces in the input string. You can do this by adding a condition to skip spaces.

In the TruncateNumber function, the math.Mod function returns the remainder of the division, which is what you want. However, you should also handle the case where the number is already an integer.

In the SumSquares function, you should use the modulo operator (%) to check if the index is a multiple of 3 or 4, not the division operator (/).

Here are the corrected versions of the functions:

import (
    "math"
)

// Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.
// >>> HasCloseElements([]float64{1.0, 2.0, 3.0}, 0.5)
// false
// >>> HasCloseElements([]float64{1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0}, 0.3)
// true
func HasCloseElements(numbers []float64, threshold float64) bool {
    for i := 0; i < len(numbers); i++ {
        for j := i + 1; j < len(numbers); j++ {
            var distance float64 = math.Abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j])
            if distance < threshold {
                return true
            }
        }
    }
    return false
}

// Input to this function is a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses. Your goal is to
// separate those group into separate strings and return the list of those.
// Separate groups are balanced (each open brace is properly closed) and not nested within each other
// Ignore any spaces in the input string.
// >>> SeparateParenGroups('( ) ((
