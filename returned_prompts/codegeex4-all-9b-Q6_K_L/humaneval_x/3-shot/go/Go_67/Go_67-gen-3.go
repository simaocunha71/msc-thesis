There are a few issues with your code that need to be addressed:

The HasCloseElements function is missing a closing brace.
The SeparateParenGroups function does not handle the case where the input string does not end with a closing parenthesis.
The TruncateNumber function is incorrect because it uses the Mod function, which returns the remainder of the division, not the decimal part of the number.
The FruitDistribution function is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the input string contains more than two numbers.

Here is the corrected code:

```go
import (
    "math"
)

// Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.
// >>> HasCloseElements([]float64{1.0, 2.0, 3.0}, 0.5)
// false
// >>> HasCloseElements([]float64{1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0}, 0.3)
// true
func HasCloseElements(numbers []float64, threshold float64) bool {
    for i := 0; i < len(numbers); i++ {
        for j := i + 1; j < len(numbers); j++ {
