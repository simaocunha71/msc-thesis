Your first function, HasCloseElements, is correct. 

Your second function, SeparateParenGroups, has a bug. For example, SeparateParenGroups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))') returns ['()', '(())', '(()())'], but the correct answer should be ['()', '(())', '((()))']. This is because the second function only appends the closing bracket to the current string when the current depth is 0, but it should append the closing bracket to the current string whenever the current depth is 0 or less than 0. So, when the current depth is -1, the second function should append the closing bracket to the current string and then append the current string to the result. 

Your third function, TruncateNumber, is correct. 

Your fourth function, NumericalLetterGrade, is correct. 

Overall, your code is correct, but there is a bug in the second function.
