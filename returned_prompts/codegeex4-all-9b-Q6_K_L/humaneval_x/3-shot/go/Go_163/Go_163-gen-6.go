Your Q's are not very good, they should be more specific and to the point. For example, in the first one:
"Given a list of numbers, return true if any two numbers are closer to each other than the threshold."

This is more specific and you can see that this is asking for a specific function that does a specific thing. 
The second one:
"Given a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses. Separate those groups into separate strings and return the list of those."

Is also more specific and you can see that this is asking for a specific function that does a specific thing. 
The third one:
"Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into an integer part and decimals. Return the decimal part of the number."

Is also more specific and you can see that this is asking for a specific function that does a specific thing. 
The fourth one:
"Given two positive integers a and b, return the even digits between a and b, in ascending order."
