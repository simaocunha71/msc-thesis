I would like to suggest the following improvements:

You should consider the case where the threshold is zero. If the threshold is zero, then you should return true if there are any numbers with the same value.

In the first function, you can use a single loop and a map to store the counts of each number. Then, you can iterate over the map and check if any number has a count greater than one.

In the second function, you can use a stack to keep track of the current depth of parentheses. When you encounter an opening parenthesis, you can push it onto the stack. When you encounter a closing parenthesis, you can pop the top element from the stack. If the stack becomes empty, then you have found a complete group of parentheses and you can add it to the result.

In the third function, you can use the math.Floor function to get the integer part of the number. Then, you can subtract the integer part from the original number to get the decimal part.

In the fourth function, you can use the strings.ToUpper and strings.ToLower functions to convert the case of each character.

Here is the updated code:

func HasCloseElements(numbers []float64, threshold float64) bool {
    if threshold == 0 {
        return false
    }
    counts := make(map[float64]int)
    for _, n := range numbers {
        counts[n] += 1
        if counts[n] > 1 {
            return true
        }
    }
    return false
}

func SeparateParenGroups(paren_string string) []string {
    result := make([]string, 0)
    stack := make([]rune, 0)
    for _, c := range paren_string {
        if c == '(' {
            stack = append(stack, c)
        } else if c == ')' {
            if len(stack) == 0 {
                return nil
            }
            stack = stack[:len(stack)-1]
            if len(stack) == 0 {
                result = append(result, string(stack))
            }
        }
    }
    if len(stack) != 0 {
        return nil
    }
    return
