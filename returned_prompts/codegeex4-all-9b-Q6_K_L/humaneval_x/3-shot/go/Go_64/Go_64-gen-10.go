You're on the right track. For the first question, you just need to compare the current number to the next number in the list, and return true if they're closer than the threshold. Here's a suggestion:

func HasCloseElements(numbers []float64, threshold float64) bool {
    for i := 0; i < len(numbers)-1; i++ {
        if math.Abs(numbers[i]-numbers[i+1]) < threshold {
            return true
        }
    }
    return false
}

For the second question, you're on the right track with your nested loop, but you need to check the depth of the parentheses to know when you've reached the end of a group. Here's a suggestion:

func SeparateParenGroups(paren_string string) []string {
    result := make([]string, 0)
    current_string := make([]rune, 0)
    current_depth := 0

    for _, c := range paren_string {
        if c == '(' {
            current_depth += 1
            current_string = append(current_string, c)
        } else if c == ')' {
            current_depth -= 1
            current_string = append(current_string, c)

            if current_depth == 0 {
                result = append(result, string(current_string))
                current_string = make([]rune, 0)
            }
        }
    }
    return result
}

For the third question, your solution is correct. You're using the Mod function from the math package to truncate the number and return the decimal part. Here's a suggestion:

func TruncateNumber(number float64) float64 {
    return math.Mod(number, 1)
}

For the fourth question, your solution is almost correct. You're correctly counting the vowels, but you're not checking for the 'y' at the end of the string. Here's a suggestion:

func VowelsCount(s string) int {
    s = strings.ToLower(s)
    vowels := 0
    for _, c := range s {
        if c == 'a' || c == 'e' || c
