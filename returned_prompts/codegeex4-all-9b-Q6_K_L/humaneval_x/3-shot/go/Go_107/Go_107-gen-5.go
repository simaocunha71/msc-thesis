HasCloseElements
Your function is correct, but it can be made more efficient. Instead of iterating through all pairs of numbers, you can sort the slice and then iterate through it once, checking the differences between adjacent numbers. This way, you only need to compare each number with its predecessor, which can save a lot of time for large slices.

SeparateParenGroups
Your function is mostly correct, but it does not handle cases where there are spaces in the input string. You should remove all spaces from the input string before processing it.

TruncateNumber
Your function is correct, but it can be made more efficient by using math.Floor instead of math.Mod.

EvenOddPalindrome
Your function is correct, but it can be made more efficient by using strconv.Itoa to convert the number to a string, instead of using the reverseString function. This way, you can directly compare the original number with its reverse, without converting it to a string twice.
