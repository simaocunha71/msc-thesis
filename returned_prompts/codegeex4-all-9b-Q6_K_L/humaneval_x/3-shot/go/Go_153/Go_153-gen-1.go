This is a good start, but there are some issues with your code.

In the HasCloseElements function, you are using math.Abs, but you don't need to. The difference between two floating-point numbers is always a positive number, so you can simply use the subtraction operation.

In the SeparateParenGroups function, you are using rune for the current_string, but you don't need to. You can use byte for efficiency.

In the TruncateNumber function, you are using math.Mod, but you don't need to. You can simply use the division operation.

In the StrongestExtension function, you are using strings.ReplaceAll, but you don't need to. You can simply use len(extension) - len(strings.ToUpper(extension)).

Here is the corrected code:

import (
    "math"
)

// Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.
// >>> HasCloseElements([]float64{1.0, 2.0, 3.0}, 0.5)
// false
// >>> HasCloseElements([]float64{1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0}, 0.3)
// true
func HasCloseElements(numbers []float64, threshold float64) bool {
    for i := 0; i < len(numbers); i++ {
        for j := i + 1; j < len(numbers); j++ {
            if math.Abs(numbers[i]-numbers[j]) < threshold {
                return true
            }
        }
    }
    return false
}

// Input to this function is a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses. Your goal is to
// separate those group into separate strings and return the list of those.
// Separate groups are balanced (each open brace is properly closed) and not nested within each other
// Ignore any spaces in the input string.
// >>> SeparateParenGroups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))')
// ['()', '(())', '(()())']
func SeparateParenGroups(paren_string string)
