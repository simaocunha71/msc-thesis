The strength of the extension is given by the fraction CAP - SM. In the code, it is written as strength := 0, which means that the strength is always 0. It should be initialized as strength := 0.0 to fix the problem.
Here is the corrected code:
func StrongestExtension(class_name string, extensions []string) string {
    max_strength := -math.MaxInt64
    max_strength_extension := ""
    for _, ext := range extensions {
        strength := 0.0
        for _, c := range ext {
            if c >= 'A' && c <= 'Z' {
                strength += 1.0
            } else if c >= 'a' && c <= 'z' {
                strength -= 1.0
            }
        }
        if strength > max_strength {
            max_strength = strength
            max_strength_extension = ext
        }
    }
    return class_name + "." + max_strength_extension
}
