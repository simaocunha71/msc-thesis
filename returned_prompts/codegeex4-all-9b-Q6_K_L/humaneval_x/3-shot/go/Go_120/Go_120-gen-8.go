There are a few issues with your code:

In HasCloseElements, you are checking for the distance between each pair of numbers, but you are not considering the threshold value. You should be checking if the distance between the numbers is less than the threshold, not just if the distance is greater than the threshold.

In SeparateParenGroups, you are not handling the case where the parentheses are not properly balanced. You are also not ignoring spaces in the input string.

In TruncateNumber, you are using the math.Mod function, which returns the remainder of the division of the number by 1. This is not the same as the decimal part of the number. You should be using the math.Trunc function, which returns the largest integer less than or equal to the number.

In Maximum, you are using the sort.Ints function, which sorts the array in ascending order. However, the problem statement says that you should return the maximum k numbers in the array, not the smallest k numbers. You should use the sort.Sort function with a custom sort function to sort the array in descending order.

Here is the corrected code:

import (
    "math"
    "sort"
)

// Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.
func HasCloseElements(numbers []float64, threshold float64) bool {
    for i := 0; i < len(numbers); i++ {
        for j := i + 1; j < len(numbers); j++ {
            var distance float64 = math.Abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j])
            if distance < threshold {
                return true
            }
        }
    }
    return false
}

// Input to this function is a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses. Your goal is to
// separate those group into separate strings and return the list of those.
// Separate groups are balanced (each open brace is properly closed) and not nested within each other
// Ignore any spaces in the input string.
func SeparateParenGroups(paren_string string) []string {
    result := make([]string, 0)
    current_string := make([]rune, 0)
    current_depth := 0

    for _, c := range paren_string {
        if c == '(' {
            current_depth += 1
            current_string = append(current_string, c)
        } else if c == ')' {
            current_depth -= 1
            current_string = append
