Your code looks good. You have a good grasp on the problem and you have provided a clear and concise explanation for each problem. Here are some minor suggestions for improvement:

In the HasCloseElements function, you can optimize the code by breaking out of the loop as soon as a pair of numbers is found that is closer than the threshold. This will save unnecessary computations.

In the SeparateParenGroups function, you can use a stack to keep track of the parentheses instead of using a depth counter. This will make the code more intuitive and easier to understand.

In the TruncateNumber function, you can use the math.Trunc function instead of math.Mod to truncate the number. This is more idiomatic Go code.

In the LargestPrimeFactor function, you can optimize the code by iterating only up to the square root of n. This is because any factor larger than the square root would have a corresponding factor smaller than the square root.

Overall, your code is well-structured and easy to follow. Here is the updated code with the suggested improvements:

func HasCloseElements(numbers []float64, threshold float64) bool {
    for i := 0; i < len(numbers); i++ {
        for j := i + 1; j < len(numbers); j++ {
            if math.Abs(numbers[i]-numbers[j]) < threshold {
                return true
            }
        }
    }
    return false
}

func SeparateParenGroups(paren_string string) []string {
    result := make([]string, 0)
    stack := make([]rune, 0)

    for _, c := range paren_string {
        if c == '(' {
            stack = append(stack, c)
        } else if c == ')' {
            if len(stack) > 0 {
                stack = stack[:len(stack)-1]
            }
            if len(stack) == 0 {
                result = append(result, paren_string)
                paren_string = ""
            }
        } else {
            paren_string += string(c)
        }
    }
    return result
}

func TruncateNumber(number float64) float64 {
    return math.Trunc(number)
}

func LargestPrimeFactor(n int) int {
    for i := 2; i*i <= n; i++ {
        if n%i == 0 {
            n = n / i
            i--
