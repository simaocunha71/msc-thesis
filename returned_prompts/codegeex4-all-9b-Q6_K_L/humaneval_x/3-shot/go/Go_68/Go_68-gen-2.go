I'm not sure why you're getting a 0 out of 0 score. All your solutions look good to me. Here's a review of your code:

In the first problem, your solution looks good. The code is well-organized, and the comments are helpful. The only minor suggestion I have is to add a comment explaining why you're using the Abs function.

In the second problem, your solution looks good. The code is well-organized, and the comments are helpful. The only minor suggestion I have is to add a comment explaining why you're using the rune type for the current_string variable.

In the third problem, your solution looks good. The code is well-organized, and the comments are helpful. The only minor suggestion I have is to add a comment explaining why you're using the Mod function.

In the fourth problem, your solution looks good. The code is well-organized, and the comments are helpful. The only minor suggestion I have is to add a comment explaining why you're using the MaxInt32 constant.

Overall, your solutions are well-written and easy to understand. I hope this helps!
