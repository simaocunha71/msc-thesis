HasCloseElements
The code seems fine, but you can use range to simplify the code:
func HasCloseElements(numbers []float64, threshold float64) bool {
    for _, n := range numbers {
        for _, m := range numbers {
            if n == m {
                continue
            }
            if math.Abs(n-m) < threshold {
                return true
            }
        }
    }
    return false
}

This approach is not the most efficient one as it performs a quadratic number of comparisons, but it's still correct. An optimized approach would involve sorting the array and then checking only adjacent elements for closeness, which would be O(n log n) in time complexity.
SeparateParenGroups
This code also seems fine, but you can simplify it using strings.Builder:
func SeparateParenGroups(paren_string string) []string {
    result := make([]string, 0)
    current_string := strings.Builder{}
    current_depth := 0

    for _, c := range paren_string {
        if c == '(' {
            current_depth += 1
        } else if c == ')' {
            current_depth -= 1
        }
        current_string.WriteRune(c)
        if current_depth == 0 {
            result = append(result, current_string.String())
            current_string.Reset()
        }
    }
    return result
}

TruncateNumber
This code is correct and efficient, so no changes are needed here.
Pluck
This code is also correct, but you can optimize it by using a map to store the occurrences of even numbers and then finding the smallest even number. This approach would be more efficient, especially for large arrays.
Here's the optimized version:
func Pluck(arr []int) []int {
    result := make([]int, 0)
    evenNumbers := make(map[int]int)

    for i, v := range arr {
        if v%2
