To make the code more idiomatic, you can use the built-in sort package to sort the slice of numbers, then iterate through the sorted slice to find if any two adjacent numbers are closer than the threshold. Here's the updated code:

```go
import (
    "sort"
)

func HasCloseElements(numbers []float64, threshold float64) bool {
    sort.Float64s(numbers)
    for i := 0; i < len(numbers)-1; i++ {
        if math.Abs(numbers[i+1]-numbers[i]) < threshold {
            return true
        }
    }
    return false
}
```

This approach is more efficient than the original code, especially when the input slice is large. The time complexity of this approach is O(n log n), where n is the length of the input slice. The space complexity is O(1), as we're not using any additional data structures.
