Your `HasCloseElements` function seems correct to me. You iterate over all pairs of elements in your list and check if their absolute difference is smaller than the threshold.

Your `SeparateParenGroups` function seems correct to me as well. You iterate over the input string, build up a string of characters that make up a group of parentheses, and when you reach a group with a depth of 0, you add it to the result list. The only thing that could be improved here is that you could add an error check when you encounter a closing parenthesis without a corresponding opening one.

Your `TruncateNumber` function seems correct to me as well. You use the `math.Mod` function to get the decimal part of the number.

Your `PrimeFib` function seems correct to me as well. You generate a list of Fibonacci numbers up to the n-th one, check if each one is prime, and return the n-th prime Fibonacci number. The only thing that could be improved here is that you could add an error check when `n` is less than 1.
