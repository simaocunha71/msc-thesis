In the first question, there's no need to use `math.Abs` as subtraction of two positive numbers will always result in a positive number.
The `HasCloseElements` function can be optimized by breaking the loop once a close element is found, which can be done by replacing `return true` with `break` in the inner loop.

For the second question, the `SeparateParenGroups` function can be optimized by using a stack to keep track of the depth of parentheses. When a closing parenthesis is encountered, the depth is decreased and if the depth becomes zero, it means a group is closed. The function can also be optimized by using a single loop and checking if the current character is an opening or closing parenthesis.

The `TruncateNumber` function can be optimized by using `math.Trunc` instead of `math.Mod` as `math.Trunc` directly gives the integer part of the number.

The `Intersperse` function can be optimized by using a single loop and checking if the current index is less than `len(numbers)-1` to append the delimeter.
