I'll do a review of the first question, I'll assume you've asked for review on each function. I'll also add comments on the second function. 

HasCloseElements
The algorithm you've implemented is O(n^2) which is not the most efficient solution. It's possible to solve this problem in O(n) time by using a single pass and maintaining a running minimum distance. Here's an example implementation:

```go
func HasCloseElements(numbers []float64, threshold float64) bool {
    minDistance := threshold + 1 // Initialize to a value greater than threshold
    for i := 1; i < len(numbers); i++ {
        distance := math.Abs(numbers[i] - numbers[i-1])
        if distance < minDistance {
            minDistance = distance
        }
        if minDistance < threshold {
            return true
        }
    }
    return false
}
```

This implementation maintains the minimum distance found so far and updates it whenever a smaller distance is found. If at any point the minimum distance is less than the threshold, the function immediately returns true. If the loop completes without finding two numbers closer than the threshold, the function returns false.

SeparateParenGroups
The implementation you've provided is correct, but it can be simplified by using a stack to keep track of the depth of nested parentheses. Here's a simplified version:

```go
func SeparateParenGroups(paren_string string) []string {
    result := make([]string, 0)
    stack := make([]rune, 0)
    currentString := ""

    for _, c := range paren_string {
        if c == '(' {
            stack = append(stack, c)
            currentString += string(c)
        } else if c == ')' {
            stack = stack[:len(stack)-1] // Pop the stack
            currentString += string(c)
            if len(stack) == 0 {
                result = append(result, currentString)
                currentString = ""
            }
        }
    }

    return result
}
```
