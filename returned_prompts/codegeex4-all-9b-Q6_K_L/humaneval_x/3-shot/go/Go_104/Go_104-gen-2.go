The first question is pretty straightforward, you just need to check if two numbers are within the given threshold from each other. You can do this by iterating over the list of numbers and checking the difference between each pair of numbers. If the difference is less than the threshold, return true.

func HasCloseElements(numbers []float64, threshold float64) bool {
    for i := 0; i < len(numbers); i++ {
        for j := i + 1; j < len(numbers); j++ {
            if math.Abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold {
                return true
            }
        }
    }
    return false
}

The second question is about parsing a string containing nested parentheses into separate groups. The approach is to iterate over the string, keeping track of the current depth of nesting. Whenever we encounter an open parenthesis, we increase the depth, and whenever we encounter a close parenthesis, we decrease the depth. When the depth reaches zero, we know that we've reached the end of a group, so we add it to the result list.

func SeparateParenGroups(paren_string string) []string {
    result := make([]string, 0)
    current_string := make([]rune, 0)
    current_depth := 0

    for _, c := range paren_string {
        if c == '(' {
            current_depth += 1
            current_string = append(current_string, c)
        } else if c == ')' {
            current_depth -= 1
            current_string = append(current_string, c)

            if current_depth == 0 {
                result = append(result, string(current_string))
                current_string = make([]rune, 0)
            }
        }
    }
    return result
}

The third question is about truncating a floating-point number. The approach is to use the math.Mod() function to find the decimal part of the number. This function returns the remainder of the division of the number by 1, which is the decimal part.
