Go has a built-in type for slices, which is named []T, where T is the type of elements. Your code uses the generic type []float64, which is a slice of 64-bit floating point numbers. There's no need to explicitly import the math package for this type.
Your code uses a double for loop to find if there are two numbers closer to each other than the given threshold. This approach has a time complexity of O(n^2), which is not efficient for large input sizes. You can improve this by sorting the slice and then iterating through it once, which will have a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting step.
The code for separating parentheses groups is mostly correct, but it doesn't handle the case where there are spaces in the input string. You should remove the spaces before processing the string.
The code for truncating a number to its decimal part is correct, but it uses the built-in math.Mod function, which is not the most efficient way to perform this operation. You can use the built-in math.Trunc function, which is specifically designed for truncating numbers.
The code for checking if a number is the multiplication of three prime numbers is incorrect. It checks if the number is divisible by any number less than it, which is not equivalent to checking if the number is the multiplication of three prime numbers. You should use a different algorithm for this problem.

Here's the improved code:
import (
    "sort"
)

func HasCloseElements(numbers []float64, threshold float64) bool {
    sort.Float64s(numbers)
    for i := 0; i < len(numbers)-1; i++ {
        if numbers[i+1]-numbers[i] < threshold {
            return true
        }
    }
    return false
}

func SeparateParenGroups(paren_string string) []string {
    paren_string = strings.ReplaceAll(paren_string, " ", "")
    result := make([]string, 0)
    current_string := make([]rune, 0)
    current_depth := 0

    for _, c := range paren_string {
        if c == '(' {
            current_depth += 1
            current_string = append(current_string, c)
        } else if c == ')' {
            current_depth -= 1
            current_string
