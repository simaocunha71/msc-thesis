The problem with the code is that there is an off-by-one error when computing the Tribonacci sequence for odd numbers. In the code, you are accessing the element at index i + 1, which does not exist when i is the last index in the array. This will cause a runtime panic.
To fix this, you should change the line:
result[i] = result[i-1] + result[i-2] + result[i+1]

to:
result[i] = result[i-1] + result[i-2] + result[i-3]

This will correctly compute the Tribonacci sequence for all values of n.
Here is the corrected code:
func Tri(n int) []float64 {
    result := make([]float64, n+1)
    result[0] = 1
    result[1] = 3
    result[2] = 2

    for i := 3; i <= n; i++ {
        if i%2 == 0 {
            result[i] = 1 + float64(i)/2
        } else {
            result[i] = result[i-1] + result[i-2] + result[i-3]
        }
    }

    return result
}

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), where n is the input to the function.
