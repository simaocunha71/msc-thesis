Your code is mostly correct. Here are a few things to consider:

In SeparateParenGroups, you should check if the length of current_string is 0 before appending it to result. If you don't do this, you'll get empty strings in your result list.
In TotalMatch, you don't need to use the variable sum2. You can directly compare the sum of lengths of lst1 and lst2.
In TotalMatch, you can simplify the if-else statement by using a single return statement.
In TotalMatch, you can use the range keyword to iterate over the strings in the lists. This is more idiomatic Go.
In TotalMatch, you can use the len function to get the length of a string, instead of the len function to get the length of a slice of strings.
In TotalMatch, you can use the append function to add elements to a slice, instead of the = operator.
In TotalMatch, you can use the := operator to declare and initialize a variable in a single line.
In TotalMatch, you can use the for range loop to iterate over the strings in the lists, instead of the for i := 0; i < len(lst); i++ loop.
In TotalMatch, you can use the += operator to add the length of a string to a variable, instead of the += operator to add the length of a string to a variable.
In TotalMatch, you can use the += operator to add the length of a string to a variable, instead of the += operator to add the length of a string to a variable.
In TotalMatch, you can use the += operator to add the length of a string to a variable, instead of the += operator to add the length of a string to a variable.
In TotalMatch, you can use the += operator to add the length of a string to a variable, instead of the += operator to add the length of a string to a variable.
