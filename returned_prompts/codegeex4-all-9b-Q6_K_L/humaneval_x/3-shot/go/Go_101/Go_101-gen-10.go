You're on the right track, but there are a few issues to address:

In the HasCloseElements function, you're comparing each pair of numbers in the slice. This is correct, but you can optimize your code by breaking out of the loop as soon as you find a pair of numbers that are closer than the threshold.
In the SeparateParenGroups function, you're not handling the case where there are spaces inside the parentheses. You need to modify your code to skip over spaces.
In the TruncateNumber function, you're using the Mod function from the math package, which is correct. However, you need to ensure that the number is positive before truncating it.
In the WordsString function, you're using the Split function from the strings package, which is correct. However, you need to modify your code to handle both commas and spaces as delimiters.

Here's the updated code:

// Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.
// >>> HasCloseElements([]float64{1.0, 2.0, 3.0}, 0.5)
// false
// >>> HasCloseElements([]float64{1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0}, 0.3)
// true
func HasCloseElements(numbers []float64, threshold float64) bool {
    for i := 0; i < len(numbers); i++ {
        for j := i + 1; j < len(numbers); j++ {
            var distance float64 = math.Abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j])
            if distance < threshold {
                return true
            }
        }
    }
    return false
}

// Input to this function is a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses. Your goal is to
// separate those group into separate strings and return the list of those.
// Separate groups are balanced (each open brace is properly closed) and not nested within each other
// Ignore any spaces in the input string.
// >>> SeparateParenGroups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))')
// ['()', '(())', '(()())']
func SeparateParenGroups(paren_string string) []string {
    result := make([]string, 0)
    current_string := make([]rune, 0)
    current_depth := 0

    for _, c := range paren_string {
        if c ==
