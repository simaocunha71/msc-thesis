You can use the sort package in Go to sort the numbers, then compare the difference between adjacent numbers.
Here is the updated code:
```go
import (
    "sort"
)

func HasCloseElements(numbers []float64, threshold float64) bool {
    sort.Float64s(numbers)
    for i := 1; i < len(numbers); i++ {
        if math.Abs(numbers[i] - numbers[i-1]) < threshold {
            return true
        }
    }
    return false
}
```
Explanation:
1. Import the sort package.
2. Sort the numbers using the sort.Float64s function.
3. Loop through the sorted numbers and compare the difference between adjacent numbers.
4. If the difference is less than the threshold, return true.
5. If no adjacent numbers are closer than the threshold, return false.
