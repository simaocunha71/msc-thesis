The first question is to check if any two numbers in an array are closer than a given threshold. You can use a nested loop to iterate over the array and calculate the absolute difference between each pair of numbers. If any pair is closer than the threshold, return true. Otherwise, return false.
The second question is to separate groups of nested parentheses in a string into separate strings. You can iterate over the string and keep track of the current depth of parentheses. When you encounter an open parenthesis, increment the depth and add it to the current string. When you encounter a close parenthesis, decrement the depth and add it to the current string. If the depth is 0, it means you have reached the end of a group, so add the current string to the result array and reset the current string. Finally, return the result array.
The third question is to truncate a given floating point number to its decimal part. You can use the math.Mod function to calculate the remainder when the number is divided by 1. This will give you the decimal part of the number.
The fourth question is to convert a string to its MD5 hash equivalent. You can use the md5 package to calculate the MD5 hash of the string. If the string is empty, return nil. Otherwise, convert the hash to a hexadecimal string and return it.
