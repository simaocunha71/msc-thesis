I'll focus on the first function you provided, HasCloseElements, and provide feedback on how I'd write it.

Your function is named HasCloseElements, which implies it checks for the existence of close elements. However, the name doesn't convey the meaning of "close elements". I'd rename the function to HasAdjacentElements or IsAdjacentElements to clearly indicate that the function checks for elements that are adjacent to each other.

In the current implementation, you use two nested loops to compare each pair of elements. This is a common approach, but it can be optimized. Instead of comparing each pair of elements, you can sort the array first and then check for adjacent elements with a single pass.

Here's an optimized version of the function:

```go
import (
    "sort"
    "math"
)

func HasCloseElements(numbers []float64, threshold float64) bool {
    sort.Float64s(numbers)

    for i := 1; i < len(numbers); i++ {
        if math.Abs(numbers[i] - numbers[i-1]) < threshold {
            return true
        }
    }

    return false
}
```

In this version, I use the sort package to sort the array of numbers. Then, I iterate over the sorted array and compare each element with its predecessor. If the absolute difference between two adjacent elements is less than the threshold, I return true. If no such pair is found, I return false.

This approach has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the length of the input array. However, it's still more efficient than the original implementation, which has a time complexity of O(n^2).
