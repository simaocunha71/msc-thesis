Why is the first one so slow?

Your implementation of HasCloseElements is a brute-force approach. The time complexity is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input slice. This is because for each element in the slice, you are iterating over the rest of the slice to find another element that is within the threshold. This can be improved to O(n log n) by sorting the slice first and then using a two-pointer approach to check for close elements.

Why is the second one so slow?

Your implementation of SeparateParenGroups is also a brute-force approach. The time complexity is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input string. This is because for each character in the string, you are checking the entire string to see if it is a matching parenthesis. This can be improved to O(n) by using a stack to keep track of the parentheses.

Why is the third one so slow?

Your implementation of TruncateNumber is using the math.Mod function, which has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the value of the input number. This is because the function needs to find the remainder of the division, which can be done by repeatedly dividing the number by 2 until it becomes 0. This can be improved to O(1) by using bit manipulation.

Why is the fourth one so slow?

Your implementation of Unique is using a loop to iterate over the input slice and append each unique element to the result slice. The time complexity is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input slice. This is because for each element in the slice, you are iterating over the rest of the slice to check if it is already in the result slice. This can be improved to O(n log n) by sorting the slice first and then using a two-pointer approach to check for duplicates.
