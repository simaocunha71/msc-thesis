Issue 1:
In the function HasCloseElements, the second loop is not starting from i + 1, it's starting from 0. This will cause the function to compare every number with every other number, which is not what we want. We want to compare each number with every other number that comes after it. So the second loop should start from i + 1.
Here is the corrected code:
func HasCloseElements(numbers []float64, threshold float64) bool {
    for i := 0; i < len(numbers); i++ {
        for j := i + 1; j < len(numbers); j++ {
            var distance float64 = math.Abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j])
            if distance < threshold {
                return true
            }
        }
    }
    return false
}

Issue 2:
In the function SeparateParenGroups, the current_string is being appended with both '(' and ')' characters. However, when the current_depth becomes 0, the current_string is being added to the result and then reset to an empty slice. This means that the last ')' character is not being added to the current_string. As a result, the last group of parentheses is not being added to the result. To fix this, we need to add a check to see if the current_depth is 0 and if so, add the ')' character to the current_string before adding it to the result.
Here is the corrected code:
func SeparateParenGroups(paren_string string) []string {
    result := make([]string, 0)
    current_string := make([]rune, 0)
    current_depth := 0

    for _, c := range paren_string {
        if c == '(' {
            current_depth += 1
            current_string = append(current_string, c)
        } else if c == ')' {
            current_depth -= 1
            current_string = append(current_string, c)

            if current_depth == 0 {
                result = append(result, string(current_string))
                current_string = make([]rune, 0)
            }
        }
    }
    return result
