Your HasCloseElements function is correct. It is a double for loop that iterates through each pair of numbers in the given list and checks if the absolute difference is less than the threshold. If it is, it returns true. If it iterates through all pairs without finding a close pair, it returns false.
Your SeparateParenGroups function is mostly correct, but it does not handle the case where there are no parentheses in the input string. In this case, it will return an empty list instead of an empty string. To fix this, you can add a check at the beginning of the function to see if the input string is empty, and return an empty list in that case.
Your TruncateNumber function is correct. It uses the math.Mod function to return the decimal part of the given number.
Your StringXor function is correct. It iterates through each character in the input strings and performs the XOR operation on them. It then returns the result as a string.
