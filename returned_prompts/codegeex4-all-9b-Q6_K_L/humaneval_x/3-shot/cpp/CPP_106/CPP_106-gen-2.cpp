Your first function looks like it should be fine. It's a simple nested loop over the input vector to check if any two numbers are within threshold of each other. One thing I would suggest is adding a check to see if the threshold is negative, because it doesn't make sense for it to be.
Your second function has a logical error. You're only checking if the level is zero when you encounter a closing parenthesis. This means that if you have two groups of parentheses that are nested one inside the other, it will only add the inner one to the vector. You should check if the level is zero after the loop completes. Additionally, the way you're building the current_paren string, it will always have an extra closing parenthesis at the end, which may cause issues later on.
Your third function is a simple calculation. You're subtracting the integer part of the number from the number itself, which should give you the decimal part. One thing I would suggest is adding a check to see if the number is negative, because it doesn't make sense for it to be.
Your fourth function has a logical error. You're checking if the index is even, and then calculating the factorial of the index if it is. However, you're not checking if the index is odd, and then calculating the sum of numbers from 1 to the index if it is. You should add an else clause to handle the odd case. Additionally, the way you're calculating the factorial, you're not checking if the index is zero, which would cause a divide by zero error. You should add a check for this case.
