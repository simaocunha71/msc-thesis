It looks like you have a few problems with your code. I'll try to help you fix them one by one.

Your code to check if there are two numbers within a certain threshold is correct, but there are some issues with the way you're using the abs function. The abs function is used to find the absolute value of a number, but in your code you're using it to compare the difference between two numbers. This is not correct. The correct way to compare the difference between two numbers is to use the subtraction operator (-) and then use the abs function on the result. Here's the corrected code:

```c++
bool has_close_elements(vector<float> numbers, float threshold){
    for (int i=0;i<numbers.size();i++)
        for (int j=i+1;j<numbers.size();j++)
            if (abs(numbers[i]-numbers[j])<threshold)
                return true;
    return false;
}
```

Your code to separate parentheses groups is correct, but there are some issues with the way you're using the push_back function. The push_back function is used to add a new element to the end of a vector, but in your code you're using it to add a new string to the vector. This is not correct. The correct way to add a new string to a vector is to create a new string and then use the push_back function on the string. Here's the corrected code:

```c++
vector<string> separate_paren_groups(string paren_string){
    vector<string> all_parens;
    string current_paren;
    int level=0;
    char chr;
    int i;
    for (i=0;i<paren_string.length();i++)
    {
        chr=paren_string[i];
        if (chr=='(')
        {
        level+=1;
        current_paren+=chr;
        }
        if (chr==')')
        {
            level-=1;
