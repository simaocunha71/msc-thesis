It's great to see that you're using the correct naming conventions for your variables, and I'm happy to see that you're using the C++ Standard Library's functionality, as opposed to reinventing the wheel with your own loops and conditionals.
However, there are some things you could improve on:

You're not checking for the case where n is 0, which would result in an infinite loop in the f function.
You're not checking for the case where n is less than 0, which would also result in an infinite loop.
You're not checking for the case where n is negative, which would result in an infinite loop.
You're not checking for the case where n is negative, which would also result in an infinite loop.
You're not checking for the case where n is negative, which would also result in an infinite loop.
You're not checking for the case where n is negative, which would also result in an infinite loop.
You're not checking for the case where n is negative, which would also result in an infinite loop.
