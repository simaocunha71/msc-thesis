Overall, your code looks good. There are only a few things I'd suggest changing.

In your has_close_elements() function, you don't need a label (A:) and you don't need to declare your variables inside the loop. The code would look better without them.
You don't need to use the math library to compute the absolute value. The abs() function is in the std namespace, so you can just use abs(numbers[i]-numbers[j]).
In your separate_paren_groups() function, you're using a for loop that increments by 1, but you can use the range-based for loop, which is more concise and easier to read.
In your truncate_number() function, you're using the math library to compute the integer part of the number, but you can use the int() function instead.
In your get_positive() function, you're using a for loop that increments by 1, but you can use the range-based for loop, which is more concise and easier to read.

Here's the updated code:

bool has_close_elements(vector<float> numbers, float threshold){
    for (auto i = numbers.begin(); i != numbers.end(); ++i) {
        for (auto j = i + 1; j != numbers.end(); ++j) {
            if (abs(*i - *j) < threshold) {
                return true;
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}

vector<string> separate_paren_groups(string paren_string){
    vector<string> all_parens;
    string current_paren;
    int level = 0;
    for (auto chr : paren_string) {
        if (chr == '(') {
            level++;
            current_paren += chr;
        } else if (chr == ')') {
            level--;
            current_paren += chr;
            if (level == 0) {
                all_parens.push_back(current_paren);
                current_paren = "";
            }
        }
    }
    return all_parens;
}

float truncate_number(float number){
    return number - int(number);
}

vector<float> get_positive(vector<float> l){
    vector<float> positive_numbers;
    for (auto num : l) {
        if (num >= 0) {
            positive_numbers.push_back(num);
        }
