First of all, you are using the absolute function correctly, but it is not declared in your code. Add this line to the top of your file:
#include <cstdlib>

Second, you should add a check that the vector is not empty before running the loop, or the function will crash when it tries to access the first element:
if (numbers.empty()) return false;

Third, you should add a check that the threshold is not negative, or the function will return true for any pair of numbers. Add this line to the top of your function:
if (threshold < 0) return false;

Fourth, you should add a check that the vector contains at least two elements, or the function will crash when it tries to access the second element. Add this line to the top of your function:
if (numbers.size() < 2) return false;

Fifth, you should not use the label A:, as it is not a valid label in C++. Instead, you should use an if statement to check if the condition is true before returning:
if (abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold) return true;

Sixth, you should add a check that the paren_string is not empty before running the loop, or the function will crash when it tries to access the first character. Add this line to the top of your function:
if (paren_string.empty()) return {};

Seventh, you should add a check that the paren_string contains only parentheses and spaces, or the function will crash when it tries to access a character that is not a parenthesis or a space. Add this line to the top of your function:
for (char c : paren_string) {
    if (c != '(' && c != ')' && c != ' ') {
        return {};
    }
}

Eighth, you should add a check that the paren_string contains balanced parentheses
