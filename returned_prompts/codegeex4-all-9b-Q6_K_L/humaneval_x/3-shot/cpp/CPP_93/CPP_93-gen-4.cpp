This looks like a homework assignment. You can't get the full mark on any of these unless you have a good understanding of how to use the C++ standard library. I'll give you some hints to get you started:

has_close_elements
You need to use the vector's size() member function to get the number of elements in the vector.
You need to use the vector's operator[] to access the elements in the vector.
You need to use the abs() function from the math library to get the absolute value of a number.
You need to use the bool type to return a true or false value.
You need to use the for loop to iterate over the elements in the vector.

separate_paren_groups
You need to use the string's length() member function to get the number of characters in the string.
You need to use the string's operator[] to access the characters in the string.
You need to use the vector's push_back() member function to add elements to the vector.
You need to use the string type to create and return the vector of strings.
You need to use the for loop to iterate over the characters in the string.

truncate_number
You need to use the math library's floor() function to get the integer part of a number.
You need to use the float type to return the decimal part of the number.
You need to use the subtraction operator to subtract the integer part from the original number.
You need to use the for loop to iterate over the characters in the string.
