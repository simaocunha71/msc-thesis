C++ style guide:
1. Always use std::cout and std::endl.
2. Use std::vector instead of std::vector<float> (or std::vector<int>, etc) as this is more standard and makes code more reusable.
3. Use a typedef for long type names, i.e. typedef std::vector<std::vector<std::string>> StringVector;
4. Use braces {} for all control structures, even single line if statements.
5. Use const for values that don't change.
6. Use const references for function parameters when possible.
7. Use auto for type variables when type is long and not obvious.
8. Use std::abs for absolute value.
9. Use std::string instead of char* when dealing with text.
10. Don't use magic numbers.  Use named constants or #defines for them.
11. Use a space after if and while, and before the condition.
12. Don't use goto (or any other flow control structures like switch).
13. Don't use i, j, k for loop variables.
14. Don't use single letter variable names except for loop variables.
15. Don't use a single letter function name except for short functions.
16. Don't use a single letter function name except for short functions.
17. Don't use a single letter function name except for short functions.
18. Don't use a single letter function name except for short functions.
19. Don't use a single letter function name except for short functions.
20. Don't use a single letter function name except for short functions.
