I'm going to make a few general comments here that you should take into account when writing your functions:

Avoid global variables. You don't need to declare a vector as global, instead pass it as an argument to the function. This makes the function more reusable.
Avoid magic numbers. When you see code that has numbers like 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8, etc. in your code, it is a good idea to define them as constants at the top of the file. This makes the code easier to read and maintain.
Avoid using namespace std;. This is a bad practice and can cause name clashes. It is better to use std::vector, std::string, etc. instead.
Avoid using namespace std; in header files. This is a bad practice and can cause name clashes. It is better to use std::vector, std::string, etc. instead.
