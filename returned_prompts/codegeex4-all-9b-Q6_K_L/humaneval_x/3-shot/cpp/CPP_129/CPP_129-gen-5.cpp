Here is a brief review of your code:
1. C++ doesn't have a built-in abs function for floats. You need to use the fabs function from the math library.
2. In the separate_paren_groups function, you don't need to check if level is zero. You can just push the current_paren into the vector and clear it as soon as you see a closing parenthesis.
3. In the truncate_number function, you don't need to cast the integer result to float. You can use static_cast<float>(number - int(number)).
4. In the minPath function, you need to implement the logic for finding the minimum path. You can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path.
