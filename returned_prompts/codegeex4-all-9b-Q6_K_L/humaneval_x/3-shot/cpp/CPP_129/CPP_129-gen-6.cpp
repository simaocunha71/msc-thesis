Question 1: has_close_elements
The algorithm is not correct. It only checks pairs of elements that are adjacent in the vector. If the threshold is small, it won't detect numbers that are far apart but within the threshold. Here's the corrected version:
bool has_close_elements(vector<float> numbers, float threshold){
    for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < numbers.size(); j++) {
            if (abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold) {
                return true;
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}

Question 2: separate_paren_groups
The algorithm is correct, but it can be simplified. You don't need to keep track of the level. Instead, you can simply count the number of open parentheses and check if it's zero after adding a closing parenthesis.
