Code Analysis:
1.
The variable names are not descriptive enough, and it's better to use different names for the variables. For instance, the variable i and j could be renamed to left and right or something similar.
2.
The code could be more efficient by using a more efficient algorithm to find the two closest numbers. For instance, you could use a sorting algorithm to sort the numbers in ascending order, and then iterate over the sorted list once to find the two closest numbers.
3.
The code could be more readable by using more meaningful variable names and adding comments to explain the code.
