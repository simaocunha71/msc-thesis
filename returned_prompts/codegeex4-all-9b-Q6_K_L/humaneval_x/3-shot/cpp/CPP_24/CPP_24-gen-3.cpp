The first problem is that your code does not compile. You need to remove the A: comments. 
The second problem is that your code does not solve the problem. You are trying to find the largest divisor, but instead you are returning the first divisor you find.
The third problem is that you are using the math library, but you don't need it. You can find the largest divisor without using the math library.
The fourth problem is that your code does not handle the case when n is 1. If n is 1, then the largest divisor is 1, but your code will return 0.
The fifth problem is that your code does not handle the case when n is 0. If n is 0, then the largest divisor is undefined, but your code will return 0.
The sixth problem is that your code does not handle the case when n is negative. If n is negative, then the largest divisor is undefined, but your code will return 0.
The seventh problem is that your code does not handle the case when n is not an integer. If n is not an integer, then the largest divisor is undefined, but your code will return the largest divisor of the integer part of n.
The eighth problem is that your code does not handle the case when n is a floating point number. If n is a floating point number, then the largest divisor is undefined, but your code will return the largest divisor of the integer part of n.
The ninth problem is that your code does not handle the case when n is a complex number. If n is a complex number, then the largest divisor is undefined, but your code will return the largest divisor of the real part of n.
The tenth problem is that your code does not handle the case when n is a string. If n is a string, then the largest divisor is undefined, but your code will return the largest divisor of the integer part of n.
The eleventh problem is that your code does not handle the case when n is a boolean. If n is a boolean, then the largest divisor is undefined, but your code will return the largest divisor of the integer part of n.
The twelfth problem is that your code does not handle the case when n is a pointer. If n is a pointer, then the largest divisor is undefined, but your code will
