Your code looks decent, but there are a few areas where it could use some improvement.

In your has_close_elements function, you have a label A: that is not used anywhere. I am assuming that is just a typo that you left in there. Labels are used to break out of nested loops, but in this case, you could just use a break statement.
Your has_close_elements function could be improved by removing the duplicate check (abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold) from the second loop. This is because the first loop already guarantees that i < j, so the second loop will never check the same pair of numbers twice.
Your separate_paren_groups function could be improved by removing the need to check if level == 0 inside the loop. Instead, you could just check if level == 0 after the loop, and if so, add the current_paren to all_parens and reset current_paren to an empty string.
Your truncate_number function could be improved by using the fmod function from the math library instead of subtracting the integer part of the number. This is because fmod will return a positive value if the number is negative, which is what you want in this case.
Your select_words function could be improved by removing the duplicate check (temp[j] == 'a' || temp[j] == 'e' || temp[j] == 'i' || temp[j] == 'o' || temp[j] == 'u') from the second loop. This is because the first loop already guarantees that temp[j] is not a space, so the second loop will never check a space.
Your select_words function could be improved by removing the need to check if temp is empty before adding it to all_parens. This is because if temp is empty,
