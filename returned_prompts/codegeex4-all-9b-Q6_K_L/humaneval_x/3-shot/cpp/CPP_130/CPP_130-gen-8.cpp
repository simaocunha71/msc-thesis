There's nothing wrong with your code. It's readable and correctly implements the requirements. However, there are a few minor improvements you could make:

Avoid using namespace std; in header files. It's not necessary, and it can cause name clashes.

You could make your functions const-correct. Since they don't modify their input parameters, you can declare them as const. This will prevent accidental modification, and it also allows the compiler to optimize better.

You can use range-based for loops to make your loops more concise and readable.

You can use std::abs instead of abs, as abs is a C-style function and std::abs is a C++ standard library function. It's generally better to use standard library functions.

Here's a modified version of your code with these improvements:

#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <cmath>

bool has_close_elements(const std::vector<float>& numbers, float threshold) {
    for (auto i = numbers.begin(); i != numbers.end(); ++i) {
        for (auto j = i + 1; j != numbers.end(); ++j) {
            if (std::abs(*i - *j) < threshold) {
                return true;
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}

std::vector<std::string> separate_paren_groups(const std::string& paren_string) {
    std::vector<std::string> all_parens;
    std::string current_paren;
    int level = 0;
    for (char chr : paren_string) {
        if (chr == '(') {
            level += 1;
            current_paren += chr;
        } else
