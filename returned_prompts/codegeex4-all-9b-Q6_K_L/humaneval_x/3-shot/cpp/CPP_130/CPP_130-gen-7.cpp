I would like to point out that the first and second question can be solved using a single loop. The third question can be solved using math.h library. The fourth question can be solved using two loops. Let me explain each question:

1. Check if in given vector of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.
This question can be solved using a single loop. You can iterate through the vector and check if the absolute difference between two numbers is less than the threshold. If it is, return true. If the loop completes without finding any two numbers closer than the threshold, return false. Here is the corrected code:

```cpp
#include <cmath> // Add this line
bool has_close_elements(vector<float> numbers, float threshold){
    for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++){
        for (int j = i + 1; j < numbers.size(); j++){
            if (std::abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold){
                return true;
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

2. Input to this function is a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses. Your goal is to separate those group into separate strings and return the vector of those.
This question can be solved using a single loop. You can iterate through the string and check if the current character is a parenthesis. If it is, add it to the current group. If the current character is a space, ignore it. If the current character is not a parenthesis or a space, it means that the current group is complete. Add it to the vector of groups and start a new group. Here is the corrected code:

```cpp
#include <string> // Add this line
#include <
