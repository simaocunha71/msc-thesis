The code you provided is mostly correct, but there are a few issues and areas for improvement:

1. In the function `has_close_elements`, you should pass the `numbers` vector as a constant reference to avoid copying the vector and to improve performance. This can be done by changing the function signature from `vector<float> numbers` to `const vector<float>& numbers`.
