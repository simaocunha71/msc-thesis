The first question is very simple. You iterate over the vector using two nested for loops, which is not a good idea. It is better to use a single loop, and check the difference between each pair of elements.
The second question is more complex. You need to keep track of the current level of parentheses, and add each character to the current string until you reach the end of the string. You can do this by iterating over each character in the string, and checking if it is an opening or closing parenthesis. If it is an opening parenthesis, you increase the level by 1, and add the parenthesis to the current string. If it is a closing parenthesis, you decrease the level by 1, and add the parenthesis to the current string. If the level is 0, you add the current string to the vector of strings, and reset the current string to an empty string.
The third question is very simple. You can use the built-in function int() to convert the number to an integer, and then subtract it from the original number to get the decimal part.
The fourth question is also very simple. You can iterate over the vector using a single loop, and check if each element is greater than the current maximum. If it is, you update the current maximum, and add it to the vector.
