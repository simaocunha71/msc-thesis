Your questions are not actually questions, they are just code snippets.  I'm not sure whether these are from some homework or a coding test or some other exercise, but whatever the case, the code snippets have some problems:

Question 1
The question is not clear.  It says "vector of numbers", but the code is looking for a vector of floats.
The comment says "Check if in given vector of numbers".  The code is looking for a vector of floats.  Is that correct?
The code does not actually check if the numbers are closer than the threshold.  It checks if the absolute value of the difference is less than the threshold.
Question 2
The function name should be all lowercase, with underscores separating words.  This is the standard naming convention for functions in C++.
The function should take a reference to the string, rather than a copy of the string.
The function should return a vector of strings, not a vector of char arrays.
The function should check that each group of parentheses is balanced, and not nested within each other.  It does not do this.
Question 3
The function name should be all lowercase, with underscores separating words.  This is the standard naming convention for functions in C++.
The function should take a reference to the float, rather than a copy of the float.
The function should return a float, not an int.
The function should truncate the number to the nearest integer, not the nearest whole number.
Question 4
The function name should be all lowercase, with underscores separating words.  This is the standard naming convention for functions in C++.
The function should take a reference to the integer, rather than a copy of the integer.
The function should return an integer, not a string.
The function should check that the integer is positive, and not negative.  It does not do this.
The function should return 0 if all digits are even.  It does not do this.
The function should multiply all the odd digits together.  It does not do this.

If you provide more context about the questions, I may be able to give more specific advice.
