Firstly, I must say that you have to use more descriptive names for your functions and variables. I know that you are a beginner and that you are not forced to do it, but it is a good practice to use names that give a good idea of what the function or variable does. For example, in the function has_close_elements you have used the variable current_paren, but it doesn't have anything to do with the parentheses. Also, the function has_close_elements is not very descriptive, it would be better to use a name that gives a good idea of what this function does. The same goes for the other functions.
Secondly, in the function has_close_elements you have used a nested for loop, but it is not necessary. You can use the function std::adjacent_find to find two elements that are closer than the given threshold. This function is more efficient than a nested for loop.
Thirdly, in the function separate_paren_groups you have used a variable level to keep track of the number of open parentheses. This is not necessary, you can use the function std::find to find the first closing parenthesis and the function std::distance to find the number of opening parentheses that are not closed yet.
Finally, in the function truncate_number you have used the function int() to truncate the number, but it is not necessary. You can use the function std::modf to separate the integer and decimal parts of the number.
