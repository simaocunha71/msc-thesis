The first function has_close_elements is very simple and you've done a good job. The only thing I'd suggest is to consider using the std::abs function instead of the C-style abs, as the latter only works on integers.
Next up is separate_paren_groups. This is a little more complicated, but not by much. Your code seems correct, but there's a potential bug that could occur. In the current implementation, if there's a closing parenthesis without a matching opening one, the function will go into an infinite loop. To fix this, you could add a check to see if the current_paren string is empty before trying to append to it. This would prevent the function from attempting to add a closing parenthesis without a matching opening one.
The truncate_number function is quite simple and you've done a good job with it. It looks like a good implementation.
Finally, triples_sum_to_zero is also quite simple and you've done a good job with it. The only thing I'd suggest is to consider using the std::sort function to sort the vector before trying to find the three elements that sum to zero. This would make the function more efficient, as it would only need to iterate through the vector once.
Overall, your code seems to be well-structured and easy to understand. The only things I'd suggest are to consider using the std::abs function instead of the C-style abs, to add a check to see if the current_paren string is empty before trying to append to it in the separate_paren_groups function, and to consider using the std::sort function to sort the vector before trying to find the three elements that sum to zero in the triples_sum_to_zero function.
