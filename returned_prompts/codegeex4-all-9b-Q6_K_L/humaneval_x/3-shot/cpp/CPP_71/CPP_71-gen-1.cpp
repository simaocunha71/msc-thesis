The question asks for a function that checks if a vector of numbers contains any two numbers closer to each other than a given threshold. This function is called has_close_elements() and takes two parameters, a vector of floats and a float. The function iterates through the vector and checks if the absolute difference between any two numbers is less than the threshold. If it is, the function returns true. If no two numbers are closer than the threshold, the function returns false.

The question asks for a function that separates groups of nested parentheses from a given string. This function is called separate_paren_groups() and takes a string as a parameter. The function iterates through the string and checks if each character is a parenthesis. If it is, the function keeps track of the level of nesting and adds the character to the current group. If the level of nesting is zero, the function adds the current group to the vector of all groups and starts a new group. The function returns the vector of all groups.

The question asks for a function that truncates a given floating point number to a decimal place. This function is called truncate_number() and takes a float as a parameter. The function subtracts the integer part of the number from the number to get the decimal part. The function returns the decimal part.

The question asks for a function that calculates the area of a triangle given the lengths of its three sides. This function is called triangle_area() and takes three floats as parameters. The function calculates the semi-perimeter of the triangle and checks if the three sides form a valid triangle. If they do, the function calculates the area of the triangle using Heron's formula and rounds it to two decimal points. If the three sides do not form a valid triangle, the function returns -1.
