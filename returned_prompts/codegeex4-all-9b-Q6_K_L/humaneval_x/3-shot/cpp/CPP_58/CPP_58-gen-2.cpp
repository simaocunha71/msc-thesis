The first question has a bug, your return statement should be outside the loop. 

You have an indentation problem in the first question, the return statement should be at the same indentation level as the for loops.
You also don't need that A: label. It doesn't add anything.

The second question has an issue with your for loop, you're iterating through all characters in the string, but you're not skipping spaces. You should add a condition to skip spaces.
Also, you're not checking if the parentheses are balanced, you're checking if the level is 0 after decrementing it, which means that you're not actually checking if it's balanced.

In the third question, your return statement should be at the same indentation level as the for loop.
You don't need the A: label.

In the fourth question, you're not using the algorithm library, you should use it. You're using the find function, but it's not the most efficient way. You should use the count function instead. Also, you're not checking if the element is already in the vector before adding it, you should do that. You're also not sorting the vector before removing duplicates, you should do that. You're also not using the algorithm library, you should use it.
