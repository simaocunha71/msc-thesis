has_close_elements
Your algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2), which is not optimal. You can improve it by only going up to the n-th element in the first loop and n-th element in the second loop.

separate_paren_groups
Your algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), which is good. However, it is not the most efficient way to do it. You can improve it by using a stack to keep track of the current level of parentheses.

truncate_number
Your algorithm is correct and efficient. However, it is not the best way to do it. You can improve it by using the fmod function from the math library.

common
Your algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2), which is not optimal. You can improve it by using a set to keep track of the unique elements in the first vector and then iterate through the second vector to find the common elements.

Overall, the algorithms in the questions are not very efficient and there are many ways to improve them.
