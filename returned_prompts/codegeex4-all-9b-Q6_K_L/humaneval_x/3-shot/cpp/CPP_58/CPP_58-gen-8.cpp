has_close_elements:

You can get rid of the label A by simply changing the indentation. Labels are an ancient and outdated way of writing code that was popular in the 1960s. You don't need them, and they make your code less readable. 
You can use the standard library function std::abs to calculate the absolute value. This is more readable and easier to understand than using the abs function.
You can use the range-based for loop instead of the traditional for loop. This makes the code more concise and easier to read.
You can use the std::any_of algorithm to check if any two numbers are closer than the threshold. This is more efficient than a nested loop.

separate_paren_groups:

The code is correct, but it can be simplified by using the std::accumulate algorithm to count the number of open parentheses. This makes the code more concise and easier to read.
You can use the std::accumulate algorithm to count the number of open parentheses. This makes the code more concise and easier to read.
You can use the std::accumulate algorithm to count the number of open parentheses. This makes the code more concise and easier to read.

truncate_number:

You can use the standard library function std::modf to split the number into the integer part and the decimal part. This is more efficient than using the int function.

common:

You can use the std::set_intersection algorithm to find the common elements of two vectors. This is more efficient than using nested loops.
