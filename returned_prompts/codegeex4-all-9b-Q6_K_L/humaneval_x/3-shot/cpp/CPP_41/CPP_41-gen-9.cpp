For the first question, you may want to consider using the STL algorithm min_element() to find the minimum element and max_element() to find the maximum element. This will simplify your code and make it more readable. Also, there are better ways to iterate through a vector than using indices.
Here is my code:
bool has_close_elements(vector<float> numbers, float threshold) {
    auto min_it = min_element(numbers.begin(), numbers.end());
    auto max_it = max_element(numbers.begin(), numbers.end());
    return *max_it - *min_it < threshold;
}

For the second question, you can use a stack to keep track of the levels of parentheses. Whenever you encounter a '(', push it into the stack. Whenever you encounter a ')', check if the top of the stack is '(', if so, pop it and increase the level by 1. If the top of the stack is not '(', then this is an unbalanced parentheses, so you should return false. At the end of the string, if the stack is not empty, then there are unbalanced parentheses, so you should return false.
Here is my code:
vector<string> separate_paren_groups(string paren_string) {
    vector<string> all_parens;
    string current_paren;
    int level = 0;
    int i = 0;
    while (i < paren_string.length()) {
        char c = paren_string[i];
        if (c == '(') {
            level++;
            current_paren += c;
        } else if (c == ')') {
            if (level == 0) {
                return vector<string>();
            }
            level--;
            current_paren += c;
            if (level == 0) {
                all_parens.push_back(current_paren);
                current_paren = "";
            }
        }
        i++;
    }
    if (level != 0) {
        return vector<string>();
    }
    return all_parens;
}

For the third question, you can use the math.h library to find the fractional part of the number. The fractional part of a number is the part after the decimal point. For example, the fractional part of 3.5 is 0.5.
Here is my code:
float truncate_number(float number) {
    return number - floor(number);
}

For the last question, you can use a simple mathematical formula to calculate the number of collisions. The number of collisions is equal to the square of
