I have reviewed your code and I have several suggestions for improvement:

The code contains several comments in Chinese. While it is possible to write comments in any language, it is generally better to use English to ensure that the code is understandable to the widest audience.

The code uses the C++ standard library, but it does not include the necessary headers for the functions it uses. For example, the code uses the vector and string classes, but it does not include the <vector> and <string> headers. This can cause compilation errors.

The code uses the abs() function from the C standard library, but it does not include the <cmath> header. This can cause compilation errors.

The code uses the MD5() function from the OpenSSL library, but it does not include the necessary headers. This can cause compilation errors.

The code uses the sprintf() function from the C standard library, but it does not include the <cstdio> header. This can cause compilation errors.

The code uses the MD5_DIGEST_LENGTH constant from the OpenSSL library, but it does not include the necessary headers. This can cause compilation errors.
