The first question has a bug. It will return true if two numbers are exactly equal to the threshold. Consider this case:
has_close_elements({1.0, 2.0, 3.0}, 1.0)

This will return true, but the expected output is false.

The second question has a bug. It will not correctly separate groups of nested parentheses that are not balanced. Consider this case:
separate_paren_groups("( ) (( )) (( )( ))")

This will return {"()", "(())", "(()())"}, but the expected output is {"()", "(())", "(( ))", "(( ))"}.

The third question has a bug. It will not correctly truncate numbers that have more than two decimal places. Consider this case:
truncate_number(3.14159)

This will return 0.14159, but the expected output is 0.59.

The fourth question has a bug. It will not correctly hash empty strings. Consider this case:
string_to_md5("")

This will return NULL, but the expected output is "d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e".
