In has_close_elements, you are returning true as soon as you find two close elements, but the problem asks whether there are any two close elements, not if any two close elements are found.
This could be solved by returning false when a pair of close elements are found instead of true.
Also, there is a minor optimization that can be done here, by moving the return false statement outside the loop.

In separate_paren_groups, you are iterating over the entire string, and for each character, you are checking if it's '(' or ')'. This could be done in a single iteration, by maintaining a counter for the number of open parentheses, and incrementing it when '(' is found, and decrementing it when ')' is found. If the counter reaches 0, then we have found a complete group of parentheses.

In truncate_number, you are using int(number) which is not a valid operation in C++. You need to use int(number) or static_cast<int>(number) instead.

In sum_squares, you are iterating over the entire list, and for each element, you are checking if the index is a multiple of 3 or 4. This could be done in a single iteration, by using the modulo operator to check if the index is a multiple of 3 or 4.
