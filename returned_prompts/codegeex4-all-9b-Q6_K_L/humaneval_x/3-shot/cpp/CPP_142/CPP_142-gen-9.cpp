The code is fine, but there are some things that could be improved:
First of all, you should be aware that the return type of a function can be anything, and it is not always a good idea to use void. In your case, the function has_close_elements does not need to return anything. It is enough that it returns a boolean value that indicates whether there are two elements closer than the given threshold. The same applies to the function separate_paren_groups. The function separate_paren_groups does not need to return anything. It is enough that it returns a vector of strings that contains the separated groups. The same applies to the function truncate_number. The function truncate_number does not need to return anything. It is enough that it returns a float value that represents the decimal part of the given number. The same applies to the function sum_squares. The function sum_squares does not need to return anything. It is enough that it returns an integer value that represents the sum of the squares of the elements in the given vector.
