In this code, you are checking every pair of numbers in the vector. This is correct, but it is not efficient. You can improve the algorithm by using a set to store the numbers. A set is a data structure that stores unique elements, and it allows for fast lookup operations. By using a set, you can reduce the time complexity of the algorithm to O(n log n), which is much better than O(n^2).

Here is the improved algorithm:

    set<float> numbers_set(numbers.begin(), numbers.end());
    for (float number : numbers_set) {
        if (numbers_set.count(number + threshold) || numbers_set.count(number - threshold)) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;

In this code, we first convert the vector of numbers to a set. Then, for each number in the set, we check if there is another number in the set
