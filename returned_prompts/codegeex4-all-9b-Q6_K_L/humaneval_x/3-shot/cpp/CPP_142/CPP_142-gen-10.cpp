The first question is a classic bubble sort. You could have also sorted the vector, then iterate through it, checking if any two adjacent elements are closer together than the threshold. This would be O(n log n) instead of O(n^2).
The second question is a string parsing problem. You could have also used a stack to keep track of the nested parentheses, but this solution is simple and works.
The third question is a simple type conversion problem. You could have also used the % operator to extract the decimal part of the number, but this solution is more straightforward.
The fourth question is a vector manipulation problem. You could have also used a for loop to iterate through the vector and check each index, but this solution is more concise.
