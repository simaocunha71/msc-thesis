1. has_close_elements
Your loop is not correctly checking pairs of elements. It should be:
for (i=0;i<numbers.size()-1;i++)
for (j=i+1;j<numbers.size();j++)

2. separate_paren_groups
Your loop is not correctly handling nested parentheses. You are assuming that the level will be 0 when you encounter the last closing parenthesis. This is not necessarily true, as there could be other closing parentheses inside the nested parentheses. You should instead check if the level is 0 after you have encountered all closing parentheses.

3. truncate_number
This function is correct.

4. find_closest_elements
Your loop is not correctly finding the two closest elements. It should be:
for (i=0;i<numbers.size()-1;i++)
for (j=i+1;j<numbers.size();j++)
