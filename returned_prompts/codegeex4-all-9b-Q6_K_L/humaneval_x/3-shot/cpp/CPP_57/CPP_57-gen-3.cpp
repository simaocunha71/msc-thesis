Firstly, I don't see any code in the question. You need to provide the code you're having trouble with.
Secondly, you're posting multiple questions in one post, which makes it difficult for anyone to answer them all. You should split them into separate questions.
Thirdly, the questions are not very clear. You need to provide more information about what the code is supposed to do, and what the expected output is.
Fourthly, the code you've posted is not complete. You need to provide the full code for each question, including the function definitions and the main function.
Lastly, the code you've posted is not very good. It's not following any good coding practices, and it's not using any of the features of the C++ language. You should try to write better code, and follow the guidelines in the C++ Core Guidelines.
