I'm not sure what your question is exactly, but here are some comments regarding your code:
Q1:
Your function name should be has_close_elements, not has_close_elements.
Your indentation is inconsistent.  You have spaces at the start of the for loops, but not the if statement.
You don't need to use abs to calculate the difference between two floats.  The difference between two floats is a float, and you can compare floats using <, >, <=, >=, and ==.
You don't need the label A: in your code.  You can just use a break statement to exit the loops.
Q2:
Your function name should be separate_paren_groups, not separate_paren_groups.
You should use std::string for the string type, not string.
You should use std::vector for the vector type, not vector.
Your indentation is inconsistent.  You have spaces at the start of the for loop, but not the if statement.
You don't need to use std::endl in your code.  You can just use a newline character '\n' to print a newline.
Your function name should be truncate_number, not truncate_number.
You should use std::vector for the vector type, not vector.
Your function name should be monotonic, not monotonic.
You should use std::vector for the vector type, not vector.
Your indentation is inconsistent.  You have spaces at the start of the for loops, but not the if statements.
You don't need to use break in your code.  You can just return false immediately when you find a pair of elements that are not monotonic.
