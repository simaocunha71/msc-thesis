Q1: The code for checking if any two numbers are closer than the threshold is almost correct. The only issue is that you are not considering the case where you may reach the end of the list and the loop is still running, so you should break the loop after the inner loop ends. Here's a corrected version:
```cpp
bool has_close_elements(vector<float> numbers, float threshold) {
    for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < numbers.size(); j++) {
            if (abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold) {
                return true;
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

Q2: The code for separating groups of parentheses is almost correct. However, you should not skip the check for the level after adding a closing parenthesis to the current group. Here's a corrected version:
```cpp
vector<string> separate_paren_groups(string paren_string) {
    vector<string> all_parens;
    string current_paren;
    int level = 0;
    char chr;
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < paren_string.length(); i++) {
        chr = paren_string[i];
        if (chr == '(') {
            level += 1;
            current_paren += chr;
        } else if (chr == ')') {
            level -= 1;
            current_paren += chr;
            if (level == 0) {
                all_parens.push_back(current_paren);
                current_paren = "";
            }
        }
    }
    return all_parens;
}
```

Q3: The code for truncating a number is correct.

Q4: The code for filtering strings by prefix is almost correct. However, you should not skip the check for the prefix after adding a string to the result. Here's a corrected version:
```cpp
vector<string> filter_by_prefix(vector<string> strings, string prefix) {
    vector<string> prefix_strings;
    string current_string;
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < strings.size();
