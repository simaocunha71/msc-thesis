You have several issues with your code, but I'll start with the most obvious one:

for (i=0;i<numbers.size();i++)
for (j=i+1;j<numbers.size();j++)

This is an O(n^2) solution. You can do this in O(nlogn) by sorting the vector first and then using a two-pointer approach.
In fact, your code seems to be a direct translation of the algorithm described in the Wikipedia page for finding the minimum number of changes to make a string a palindrome. The same algorithm can be applied to your vector of numbers. You can find an implementation of this algorithm here.

The second issue is with your function separate_paren_groups. It doesn't handle the case where there is an unmatched closing parenthesis. For example, if the input string is "( ( ) ) )", your function will return {"( () )"} instead of {"( () )", ")"}. You can fix this by adding a check for unmatched closing parentheses after the loop.

The third issue is with your function truncate_number. It doesn't handle the case where the input number is negative. You can fix this by adding a check for negative numbers before the return statement.

The fourth issue is with your function smallest_change. It doesn't handle the case where the input vector is empty. You can fix this by adding a check for empty vectors before the loop.

Here is the corrected code:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

bool has_close_elements(vector<float> numbers, float threshold) {
    sort(numbers.begin(), numbers.end());
    int i = 0, j = numbers.size() - 1;
    while (i < j) {
        if (numbers[j] - numbers[i] < threshold) {
            return true;
        }
        i++;
        j--;
    }
    return false;
}

vector<string> separate_paren_groups(string paren_string) {
    vector<string> all_parens;
    string current_paren;
    int level = 0;
    char chr;
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < paren_string.length(); i++) {
        chr = paren_string[i];
        if (chr == '(') {
            level++;
