There's no need for the comments in your code. The comments are a bit redundant, since your variable names are descriptive enough. You do a good job of using descriptive variable names, which is great! The only thing I'd suggest is to add a comment to the A: line to indicate where the answer starts.
In your has_close_elements function, there's no need to use a goto, since your for loop will naturally exit when you find a pair of elements that are close enough. You can remove the goto statement and the label A: altogether.
In your separate_paren_groups function, you're not checking whether the input string is properly balanced. You're assuming that the input string is always balanced, but this is not necessarily the case. You should add a check to make sure that the input string is properly balanced before separating the groups.
In your truncate_number function, you're using the int() cast to truncate the number, but this is not a good approach. The int() cast will truncate the number towards zero, which is not always what you want. Instead, you should use the floor() function to truncate the number towards negative infinity.
In your smallest_change function, you're iterating over the entire array, even though you only need to iterate over half of the array. You can remove the second half of the loop since it's symmetric to the first half.
Here's your revised code:

#include<stdio.h>
#include<vector>
#include<math.h>
using namespace std;
bool has_close_elements(vector<float> numbers, float threshold){
    for (int i=0;i<numbers.size();i++)
        for (int j=i+1;j<numbers.size();j++)
            if (abs(numbers[i]-numbers[j])<threshold)
                return true;
    return false;
}

#include<stdio.h>
#include<vector>
#include<string>
using namespace std;
vector<string> separate_paren_groups(string paren_string){
    vector<string> all_parens;
    string current_paren;
    int level=0;
    char chr;
    int i;
    for (i=0;i<paren_string.length();i++)
    {
        chr=paren_string[i];
        if (chr=='(')
