In the first function, you're comparing the absolute difference between elements to the threshold, but this is not how you would determine if two elements are closer than a given threshold.
You need to loop through each element and compare it to every other element to see if they are closer than the threshold. Here is a simple implementation of that:

for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++) {
    for (int j = i + 1; j < numbers.size(); j++) {
        if (abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold) {
            return true;
        }
    }
}

return false;

In the second function, you're looping through the string and adding characters to the current_paren string. However, you're not checking if the parentheses are balanced or not. You can use a stack to keep track of the open parentheses and pop them off the stack when you encounter a closing parenthesis. If the stack is empty when you encounter a closing parenthesis, then the parentheses are not balanced. Here is a simple implementation of that:

vector<string> separate_paren_groups(string paren_string) {
    vector<string> all_parens;
    string current_paren;
    stack<char> parentheses;
    char chr;
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < paren_string.length(); i++) {
        chr = paren_string[i];
        if (chr == '(') {
            parentheses.push(chr);
            current_paren += chr;
        } else if (chr == ')') {
            if (parentheses.empty()) {
                throw runtime_error("Unbalanced parentheses");
            }
            parentheses.pop();
            current_paren += chr;
            if (parentheses.empty()) {
                all_parens.push_back(current_paren);
                current_paren = "";
            }
        }
    }
    if (!parentheses.empty()) {
        throw runtime_error("Unbalanced parentheses");
    }
    return all_parens;
}

In the third function, you're simply subtracting the integer part of the number from the number itself. This is not how you would truncate the number. You would need to multiply the number by 10 to the power of the number of decimal places you want to keep, then subtract the integer part from the result. Here is a simple implementation of that:

float truncate_number(float number) {
    int decimal_places = 2; // Change this
