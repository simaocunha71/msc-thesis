In the has_close_elements function you are not including the threshold in your comparison.  You should have
if (abs(numbers[i]-numbers[j])<threshold)

instead of
if (abs(numbers[i]-numbers[j])<threshold)

In the separate_paren_groups function, you should add a check for the parenthesis balance.  If the parentheses are unbalanced, the function will return a vector with an empty string.  You should add a check for this and return an empty vector in this case.
In the truncate_number function, you should check for NaN and positive or negative infinity values.  If the number is NaN, positive infinity, or negative infinity, the function should return NaN, positive infinity, or negative infinity, respectively.  You should also check for negative numbers and return NaN in this case.
In the is_simple_power function, you should check if x is less than 1.  If x is less than 1, the function should return false.  You should also check if n is less than or equal to 0.  If n is less than or equal to 0, the function should return false.
