First, let's go through the general issues with your code:

Variable naming
In your second function, you have a variable named chr. This is not a very good name because it doesn't tell you anything about what the variable is used for. Instead, you could name it something like currentChar or parenChar to make it clear that this variable is used to store a character from the string.
In your first function, you have a variable named i. This is also not a very good name because it doesn't tell you anything about what the variable is used for. Instead, you could name it something like index or counter to make it clear that this variable is used to count something.

Code style
In your second function, you have a lot of spaces around your operators. This can make your code harder to read. Instead, you should try to follow the standard formatting conventions for your programming language.

Algorithm
In your second function, you are using a nested loop to iterate through all pairs of characters in the string. However, you don't need to do this. You can use a single loop to iterate through all characters in the string and keep track of the current level of nesting.

Overall, your code is mostly good, but there are some issues with variable naming and code style that you should fix.
