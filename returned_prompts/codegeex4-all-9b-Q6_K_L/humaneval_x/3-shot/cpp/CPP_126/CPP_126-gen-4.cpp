has_close_elements
The code could be more efficient if you didn't use nested for loops, but rather used a single loop and maintained the index of the closest element seen so far. If the current element is closer to the index of the last seen element than to the index of the last closest element, update the last closest element to the current element. This way, you only have to loop through the vector once.
Also, it's a bit unclear what you mean by "closer to each other than given threshold". If you're looking for elements that are within threshold distance of each other, then the condition should be abs(numbers[i]-numbers[j]) <= threshold, not abs(numbers[i]-numbers[j]) < threshold.
separate_paren_groups
The code is missing a check to ensure that the parentheses are properly balanced. If the input string contains an unbalanced set of parentheses, the function will fail.
truncate_number
The code is correct, but it's not very efficient. It's better to use the fmod function from the math library to get the fractional part of a number.
is_sorted
The code is correct, but it could be more efficient. If the list is sorted, you can use the std::is_sorted function from the algorithm library to check if the list is sorted. This function is implemented in a way that is more efficient than a simple loop.
