Overall
These are all well written functions. They are easy to understand, well documented with comments, and their names are descriptive of what they do. You have a good use of standard library functions, and your use of the standard namespace is appropriate.

has_close_elements

You have good use of the standard library function abs in this function. The only problem is that you have a label A: that is never used. This is a compiler warning.

separate_paren_groups

This function is well written. You have good use of the standard library string function length() and the standard vector function push_back().

truncate_number

This function is simple and correctly implemented. It uses the standard library function int() to convert the float to an integer, and then returns the difference between the original number and the integer. This is the correct approach.

match_parens

This function is well written. It correctly uses the standard library functions string length() and vector size(). The only problem is that you have a return statement that returns "No" without checking if the parentheses are balanced. You should check if level is 0 before returning "No".
