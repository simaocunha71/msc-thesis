A few things:

You shouldn't use the namespace std. It's good practice to avoid using it, and you have no reason to use it anyway, so don't.
You should use auto where possible. In your functions, the return types of your functions are known, so you don't need to specify them.
You don't need to use std:: in front of vector and string since you're already using the std namespace.
In your has_close_elements function, you don't need to use abs. The absolute value of a float is the value itself.
Your separate_paren_groups function has a bug. If the string ends with a parenthesis, it will not be added to the vector. You should add a check for this.
Your truncate_number function is correct, but you can use the fmod function instead of subtracting the integer part from the original number.
Your histogram function is correct, but you can use the count function of the map to count the number of occurrences of each character.
In your histogram function, you should return a map of pairs, not a map of chars. The pairs should contain the character and the count.

Here's the corrected code:
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <map>
#include <cmath>

using std::vector;
using std::string;
using std::map;

bool has_close_elements(const vector<float>& numbers, float threshold) {
    for (size_t i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++) {
        for (size_t j = i + 1; j < numbers.size(); j++) {
            if (std::abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold) {
                return true;
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}

vector<string> separate_paren_groups(const string& paren_string) {
    vector<string> all_parens;
    string current_paren;
    int level = 0;
    for (char chr : paren_string) {
        if (chr == '(') {
            level += 1;
            current_paren += chr;
        } else if (chr == ')') {
            level -= 1;
            current_paren += chr;
