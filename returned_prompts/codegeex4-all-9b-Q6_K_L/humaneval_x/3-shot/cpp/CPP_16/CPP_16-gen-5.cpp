Q1: has_close_elements
Your algorithm is correct, but can be simplified and made more efficient.
You don't need to use the abs function, since you're comparing to 0, which is always positive.
Also, you don't need to use the loop to check if you need to add the current_paren to the vector.
You can add the current_paren directly to the vector, if the level is 0.
Here's a more efficient version of your code:
bool has_close_elements(vector<float> numbers, float threshold){
    for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); ++i) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < numbers.size(); ++j) {
            if (numbers[i] - numbers[j] < threshold) {
                return true;
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}

Q2: separate_paren_groups
Your algorithm is correct, but can be simplified and made more efficient.
You can use a stringstream to split the string into groups of parentheses.
Here's a more efficient version of your code:
vector<string> separate_paren_groups(string paren_string){
    vector<string> all_parens;
    stringstream ss(paren_string);
    string current_paren;
    char chr;
    while (ss >> chr) {
        if (chr == '(') {
            current_paren += chr;
        } else if (chr == ')') {
            current_paren += chr;
            if (current_paren.length() % 2 == 0) {
                all_parens.push_back(current_paren);
                current_paren.clear();
            }
        }
    }
    return all_parens;
}

Q3: truncate_number
Your algorithm is correct, but can be simplified.
You can use the fmod function to get the decimal part of the number.
Here's a more efficient version of your code:
float truncate_number(float number){
    return fmod(number, 1);
}

Q4: count_distinct_characters
Your algorithm is correct, but can be simplified.
You can use a set to store the unique characters.
Here's a more efficient version of your code:
int count_distinct_characters(string str){
