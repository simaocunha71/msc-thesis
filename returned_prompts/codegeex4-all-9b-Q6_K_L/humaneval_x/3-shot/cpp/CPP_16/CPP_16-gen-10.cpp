A couple of small things you can do to improve your code:

Use std::abs() instead of the C-style abs() function.  While it's not a huge deal, it's better to use the standard library functions whenever possible.
When you're using a standard library function like find(), always check that the result is not end().  If it is, the function didn't find anything, and you should handle that case.
Use the range-based for loop to iterate over the vector.  It's more readable and safer than using the traditional for loop.
Use the vector's size() function to get its length.  It's more readable and safer than using the .size() member variable.
Use the tolower() function from the cctype library instead of the one from the string library.
Use the erase() function to remove an element from a vector.  It's more efficient than creating a new vector with the elements you want.
Use the clear() function to remove all elements from a vector.  It's more efficient than creating a new vector with no elements.
Use the resize() function to set the size of a vector.  It's more efficient than creating a new vector with the specified size.

Here's the code with the suggestions applied:

bool has_close_elements(const std::vector<float>& numbers, float threshold)
{
    for (const auto& i : numbers)
    {
        for (const auto& j : numbers)
        {
            if (i != j && std::abs(i - j) < threshold)
            {
                return true;
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}

std::vector<std::string> separate_paren_groups(const std::string& paren_string)
{
    std::vector<std::string> all_parens;
    std::string current_paren;
    int level = 0;
    for (char chr : paren_string)
    {
        if (chr == '(')
        {
            ++level;
            current_paren += chr;
        }
        else if (chr == ')')
        {
            --level;
            current_paren += chr;
            if (level == 0
