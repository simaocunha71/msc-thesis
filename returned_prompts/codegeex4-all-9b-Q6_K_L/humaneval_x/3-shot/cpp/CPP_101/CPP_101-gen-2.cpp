In the first function, you are returning true when you find any pair of numbers which are closer than the threshold. But the question asks to return true only if there are two numbers in the list which are closer to each other than the threshold, and no other pair.
So, you need to add a check that you only return true if the difference between the current pair of numbers is the smallest difference so far. Here's the modified function:
bool has_close_elements(vector<float> numbers, float threshold){
    int i,j;
    float min_diff = threshold + 1; // Initialize min_diff to a value greater than threshold
    for (i=0;i<numbers.size();i++){
        for (j=i+1;j<numbers.size();j++){
            float diff = abs(numbers[i]-numbers[j]);
            if (diff < min_diff){
                min_diff = diff;
            }
        }
    }
    return (min_diff < threshold);
}

In the second function, you are returning the vector of all substrings between pairs of parentheses. But the question asks to return the vector of the substrings that are separated by commas. So, you need to modify the function to split the string at commas instead of parentheses. Here's the modified function:
vector<string> separate_paren_groups(string paren_string){
    vector<string> all_parens;
    string current_paren;
    int level=0;
    char chr;
    int i;
    for (i=0;i<paren_string.length();i++){
        chr=paren_string[i];
        if (chr==','){
            if (level==0){ // Only add the current_paren to all_parens if level is 0
                all_parens.push_back(current_paren);
                current_paren="";
            }
        } else if (chr=='('){
            level+=1;
            current_paren+=chr;
        } else if (chr==')'){
            level-=1;
            current_paren+=chr;
        }
    }
    if (level==0){ // Add the last current_paren to all_parens if level is 0
        all_parens.push_back(current_paren);
