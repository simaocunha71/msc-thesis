has_close_elements

You have a bug in your loop. You should loop over all pairs of numbers, so the loop should end at i < numbers.size() - 1, not i < numbers.size().
Also, your function should return true as soon as it finds a pair of numbers close to each other, not false. You can use break to exit the loop early.

separate_paren_groups

Your function is mostly correct, but it doesn't handle the case where the input string contains spaces. You should remove them before processing the string.
Also, your function should handle the case where the input string doesn't contain any parentheses. You should return an empty vector in that case.

truncate_number

Your function is correct.

compare

Your function is correct.
