First, I'll just mention some general comments:

You are using the C++ Standard Library, so it is best to use the standard names for functions and classes, instead of mixing C and C++ names. For example, instead of using printf, use std::cout.
Your code has no comments explaining what it does, or how it works. This makes it very difficult for anyone else to understand it. You should add comments to explain your code.
Your code does not handle any errors. For example, if the input vector is empty, your code will crash. You should add error handling code to handle these cases.
Your code does not handle any edge cases. For example, if the threshold is 0, your code will return false, even if there are two numbers that are equal. You should add code to handle these edge cases.
Your code does not handle any special characters. For example, if the input string contains a newline character, your code will crash. You should add code to handle these special characters.
Your code does not handle any invalid input. For example, if the input string contains a character that is not a digit, your code will crash. You should add code to handle this case.
Your code does not handle any out-of-range errors. For example, if the input string is too long, your code will crash. You should add code to handle this case.
Your code does not handle any memory allocation errors. For example, if there is not enough memory to allocate a new string, your code will crash. You should add code to handle this case.
Your code does not handle any invalid arguments. For example, if the input string is not a valid string, your code will crash. You should add code to handle this case.
Your code does not handle any invalid parameters. For example, if the input string is not a valid string, your code will crash. You should add code to handle this case.
Your code does not handle any invalid data. For example, if the input string is not a
