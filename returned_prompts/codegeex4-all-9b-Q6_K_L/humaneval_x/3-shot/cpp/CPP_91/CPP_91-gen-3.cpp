Comments
The comments for the functions are missing some detail.  They don't describe the function parameters or return values.
Missing return statements
Your functions return true or false, but in some cases you don't return anything.  You need to add return statements to cover all code paths.
Return type
The return types for your functions are not specified.  You need to specify the return type for each function, and make sure that it matches the return statement.
Semicolons
You have some semicolons after the function definitions.  You don't need them.
Variable names
You have some variables named i and j.  It's better to use more descriptive variable names.
Missing include statements
You are using the math.h library, but you don't include it.  You need to add #include <math.h> to the top of your file.
Missing namespace
You are using the std namespace, but you don't include it.  You need to add using namespace std; to the top of your file.
Missing #include <iostream>
You are using the std namespace, but you don't include the iostream library.  You need to add #include <iostream> to the top of your file.
