Q1: There's a more efficient way to write your code for Q1. You don't need to use a nested loop to compare every possible pair of elements in the vector. Instead, you can sort the vector and compare adjacent elements. This will be more efficient because you only need to compare each element with its immediate neighbors.
Q2: In your code for Q2, you're using a for loop to iterate over the characters in the string. However, you're not actually using the characters in the loop. You're just checking if the character is a '(' or ')', and if it is, you're incrementing or decrementing the level variable. You don't need to use a for loop to do this. Instead, you can use an if statement to check if the character is a '(' or ')', and then increment or decrement the level variable accordingly.
Q3: In your code for Q3, you're using the int() function to convert the float number to an integer. However, this will truncate the decimal part of the number, which is not what you want. You can use the fmod() function to get the decimal part of the number instead.
Q4: In your code for Q4, you're using a for loop to iterate over the extensions. However, you're not actually using the extensions in the loop. You're just calculating the strength of each extension and comparing it to the maximum strength. You don't need to use a for loop to do this. Instead, you can use an if statement to compare the strength of each extension to the maximum strength.
