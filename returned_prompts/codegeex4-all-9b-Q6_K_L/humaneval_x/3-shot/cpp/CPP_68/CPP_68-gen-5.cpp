Your questions are about code review.  We can't really review the code you've posted, because it isn't here.  However, I can tell you what you should be looking for in your code and the code you've been given.

Make sure your code is self-documenting.  Avoid the use of single-letter variable names and obscure function names.  Use descriptive names for your variables and functions, so that someone reading your code will understand what it does.  If you're using a language that supports it, use comments to describe the purpose of your code, and how to use it.

Make sure your code is efficient.  If you're given a vector of numbers and asked if any two of them are within a certain threshold of each other, you should not be using a nested loop to compare every pair of numbers.  Instead, you should be sorting the vector and then using a single loop to compare adjacent numbers.  This will reduce the time complexity of your code from O(n^2) to O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the vector.

Make sure your code is robust.  If you're given an empty vector, or a vector with all odd numbers, or a vector with all the same number, or a vector with negative numbers, your code should still work correctly.  Write unit tests to make sure that your code handles all of these cases.

Make sure your code is secure.  If you're given a string containing nested parentheses, you should be careful to ensure that your code doesn't crash or produce incorrect results if the parentheses are not balanced.  Use a stack to keep track of the parentheses as you parse the string, and make sure that every open parenthesis has a corresponding close parenthesis.

Make sure your code is maintainable.  If you're given a vector of numbers and asked to find the smallest even number, and then asked to find the largest odd number, it would be better to write two separate functions than to write one function that does both things.  This will make your code easier to
