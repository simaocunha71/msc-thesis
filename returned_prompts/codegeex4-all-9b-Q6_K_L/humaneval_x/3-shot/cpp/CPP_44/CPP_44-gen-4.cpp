Overall, your code looks great!  I just have a couple of minor comments:

Your code does not have any comments explaining what each function does or what the expected input/output is.  It would be good to add some comments to make your code more readable.  For example, you could add a comment to the has_close_elements function to explain that it checks if any two numbers in the input vector are closer than the given threshold.

Your code does not handle any error cases.  For example, what should happen if the input vector is empty in the has_close_elements function?  It would be good to add some error checking to handle these cases.

Your code does not use any comments to explain what each variable is or what it represents.  It would be good to add some comments to make your code more readable.  For example, you could add a comment to the i and j variables in the has_close_elements function to explain that they are used to iterate over the input vector.
