First, please note that the code you posted is not a complete program. You are missing the main function that would call and test your functions. Also, it would be good to add the return 0; statement at the end of the main function.
Now, let's start reviewing your code.

For your first function, you are using a nested loop which is not necessary. You can use a single loop to iterate over the vector and compare each number with the others. Here is a possible implementation:
bool has_close_elements(vector<float> numbers, float threshold) {
    for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < numbers.size(); j++) {
            if (abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold) {
                return true;
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}

For your second function, you are using a for loop to iterate over the characters of the string. However, you can use a range-based for loop instead, which is more readable and concise. Here is a possible implementation:
vector<string> separate_paren_groups(string paren_string) {
    vector<string> all_parens;
    string current_paren;
    int level = 0;
    for (char chr : paren_string) {
        if (chr == '(') {
            level++;
            current_paren += chr;
        } else if (chr == ')') {
            level--;
            current_paren += chr;
            if (level == 0) {
                all_parens.push_back(current_paren);
                current_paren = "";
            }
        }
    }
    return all_parens;
}

For your third function, you are using the int() function to truncate the number. However, this function returns the integer part of the number, not the decimal part. You can use the fmod() function instead, which returns the remainder of the division of the number by 1. Here is a possible implementation:
float truncate_number(float number) {
    return fmod(number, 1);
}

For your fourth function, you are using a while loop to convert the number to its base representation
