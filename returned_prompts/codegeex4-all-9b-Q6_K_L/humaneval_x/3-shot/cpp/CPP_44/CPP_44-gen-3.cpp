The first question is solved correctly, but there are some redundancies in your code:

You don't need to declare a variable i and j, because the for loop already has its own iteration variable.
You don't need to have a label A: before the loop.

The second question is also solved correctly, but there are some redundancies:

You don't need to declare a variable i, because the for loop already has its own iteration variable.
You don't need to have a variable chr, because you can use the iteration variable directly.
You don't need to have a variable level, because you can use a boolean variable to keep track of the level.
You don't need to have a variable current_paren, because you can use a string to keep track of the current parentheses.
You don't need to have a function separate_paren_groups, because you can use a simple loop to iterate over the string and check if the current character is a parenthesis.

The third question is solved correctly, but there are some redundancies:

You don't need to have a function truncate_number, because you can use the built-in function fmod to calculate the decimal part of the number.

The fourth question is solved correctly, but there are some redundancies:

You don't need to have a function change_base, because you can use a simple loop to iterate over the number and calculate the remainder.
You don't need to have a variable result, because you can use a string to keep track of the result.

Overall, your code is correct, but there are some redundancies that can be eliminated.
