1. has_close_elements
Your algorithm has an O(n^2) complexity, which is not optimal. You can improve it by sorting the array first. In this way, you only need to check adjacent elements, which are guaranteed to be closer than non-adjacent ones.
2. separate_paren_groups
Your code is missing a check to ensure that the input string is balanced. For example, if the string is "(())((())", then your code will not correctly separate the groups. To fix this, you can add a check to ensure that the level is zero at the end of the loop.
3. truncate_number
Your code is correct, but you can simplify it by using the fmod function.
4. fib
Your code is correct, but you can simplify it by using the formula fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2) directly.
