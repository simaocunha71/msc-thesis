First, I would like to point out that you are not using any of the functions that are defined in the standard C++ library.  The only functions that you use are std::abs and std::vector, and these are not used in any of your functions.  Instead, you are using C-style functions and constructs.  I would highly recommend you to use the C++ standard library as much as possible.
The first function has_close_elements has several issues.  First, it is not clear from the function name what it does.  The name suggests that it checks if there are any close elements, but it is not clear what it means by close.  The name should be changed to something that is more descriptive.  Secondly, there is a bug in the function.  The function returns true if there are any two numbers that are closer to each other than the threshold, but it should return true if there are any two numbers that are closer to each other than the threshold, but not equal to each other.  This can be fixed by adding a check to see if the two numbers are equal.
The second function separate_paren_groups is also not clear from the function name what it does.  The name suggests that it separates paren groups, but it is not clear what it means by paren groups.  The name should be changed to something that is more descriptive.  Also, there is a bug in the function.  The function does not handle cases where there are spaces in the input string.  This can be fixed by adding a check to see if the current character is a space and then skipping it.
The third function truncate_number is also not clear from the function name what it does.  The name suggests that it truncates a number, but it is not clear what it means by truncating a number.  The name should be changed to something that is more descriptive.  Also, there is a bug in the function.  The function does not handle cases where the number is negative.  This can be fixed by adding a check to see if the number is negative and then returning -1.0.
The fourth function how_many_times is also not clear from the function name what it does.  The
