The first function looks good. The for loops are clearly defined and the logic is easy to follow.
In the second function, you could use a stringstream to extract the strings, and a stringstream iterator to iterate over the parentheses. This could make your code more concise.
In the third function, you could use the modulus operator (%) to avoid the call to int(). This is a common trick in C++ to get the fractional part of a floating point number.
In the fourth function, you could use a for loop with a range-based for loop to iterate over the string. This could make your code more concise and easier to read.
