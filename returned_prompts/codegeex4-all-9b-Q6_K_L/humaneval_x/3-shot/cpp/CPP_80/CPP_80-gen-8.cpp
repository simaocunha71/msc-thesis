Your answers are mostly correct, but you have several issues that can be improved:

For has_close_elements(), your function is correct, but could be simplified using the standard library algorithms minmax_element() and any_of():
bool has_close_elements(vector<float> numbers, float threshold) {
    return any_of(numbers.begin(), numbers.end(), [&](float n) {
        auto [min, max] = minmax_element(numbers.begin(), numbers.end());
        return max - min < threshold;
    });
}

For separate_paren_groups(), your function is mostly correct, but there are a few issues:

You are not handling the case where there are no parentheses in the string. In this case, your function will return an empty vector, which is not correct. You should return an empty vector if there are no parentheses.
You are not handling the case where there are spaces in the string. Your function will skip over spaces, but this could cause unexpected behavior if the spaces are not inside parentheses.
Your function is not efficient. It uses a nested loop to iterate over all pairs of parentheses, which can be slow for large strings. You can improve the efficiency of your function by using a stack to keep track of the parentheses you have seen so far. This will allow you to separate the groups of parentheses in a single pass through the string.

Here is a revised version of your function that addresses these issues:
vector<string> separate_paren_groups(string paren_string) {
    vector<string> all_parens;
    string current_paren;
    int level = 0;
    char chr;
    int i;
    bool has_parentheses = false;

    for (i = 0; i < paren_string.length(); i++) {
        chr = paren_string[i];
        if (chr == '(') {
            level += 1;
            current_paren += chr;
            has_parentheses = true;
        } else if (chr == ')') {
            level -= 1;
            current_paren += chr;
            if (level == 0) {
                all_parens.push_back(current_paren);
                current_paren = "";
            }
        }
    }

    if (!has_parentheses) {
        return {};
    }
