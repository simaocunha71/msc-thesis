has_close_elements
Your code looks fine, but there is a bug in your function.  You should be checking that the current pair of numbers is closer than the given threshold before you return true.  Your current code returns true as soon as it finds a pair of numbers that are close to each other, regardless of what the threshold is.  This is likely a bug.  I don't know whether you want to return true if any pair of numbers is closer than the threshold, or if you want to return true if the closest pair of numbers is closer than the threshold.  If it's the former, then you should move the return true statement inside the if statement.  If it's the latter, then you should keep the return true statement where it is, but you should keep track of the smallest difference you've seen so far and return true if the smallest difference is smaller than the threshold, and false otherwise.
separate_paren_groups
Your code looks fine, but there is a bug in your function.  You should be checking that the current level is zero before you add the current_paren to all_parens.  Your current code adds the current_paren to all_parens as soon as you see a closing parenthesis, even if the current level is not zero.  This is likely a bug.  I don't know whether you want to add the current_paren to all_parens as soon as you see a closing parenthesis, or if you want to add the current_paren to all_parens only after you've seen all of the closing parentheses that correspond to the opening parenthesis that you saw first.  If it's the former, then you should move the if statement inside the for loop.  If it's the latter, then you should keep the if statement where it is, but you should keep track of the opening parenthesis that you saw first and only add the current_paren to all_parens if the current level is zero and the current parenthesis is the same as the opening parenthesis that you saw first.
