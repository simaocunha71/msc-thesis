The main issues are:

Use of goto: This is a bad practice and should be avoided.
Use of the math library: This is unnecessary and can be replaced with the fmod() function from the algorithm library.
Use of the algorithm library: This is unnecessary and can be replaced with the sort() function from the algorithm library.
Use of using namespace std: This is generally considered bad practice and should be avoided.

Here's a version of your code with these issues fixed:

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
