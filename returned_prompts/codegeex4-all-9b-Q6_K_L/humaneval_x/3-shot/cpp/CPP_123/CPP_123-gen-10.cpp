Firstly, I'd like to note that this question is not a good fit for CodeReview, as it is a homework assignment. However, I will provide some general feedback on the code.

I would suggest using the range-based for loop instead of the traditional for loop for iterating over the vector. It can make the code more readable and less prone to errors. For example:
for (float number : numbers) {
    // Do something with number
}

In the has_close_elements function, you are using a label (A) to break out of the nested loop. This is not a good practice as it makes the code harder to read and understand. Instead, you can use a boolean variable to track whether a close element has been found:
bool found_close_element = false;
for (i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++) {
    for (j = i + 1; j < numbers.size(); j++) {
        if (abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold) {
            found_close_element = true;
            break;
        }
    }
    if (found_close_element) {
        break;
    }
}
return found_close_element;

In the separate_paren_groups function, you are using a for loop to iterate over the characters in the string. However, you can simplify the code by using a range-based for loop, which can make the code more readable and less prone to errors. For example:
for (char chr : paren_string) {
    // Do something with chr
}

In the truncate_number function, you are using the int() typecast to convert the number to an integer. However, this can lead to unexpected results if the number is not a whole number. Instead, you can use the floor() function to truncate the number:
return number - floor(number);

In the get_odd_collatz function, you are using the sort() function to sort the
