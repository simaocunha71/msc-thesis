has_close_elements
You're missing the header for std::abs. You're also not using the for loop indices correctly. The inner loop should start at i+1, not 0. And you should use the indices for the loop, not numbers.size().

separate_paren_groups
You're missing the headers for std::string and std::vector. You're also missing a return statement at the end of the function. And you're not checking if chr is a space before adding it to current_paren.

truncate_number
You're missing the header for std::abs.

get_odd_collatz
You're missing the headers for std::vector and std::sort. You're also not checking if n is greater than 1 before entering the loop. And you're not returning the vector at the end of the function.

Overall, you're missing a lot of headers and return statements. You should also consider adding comments to explain what each function does.
