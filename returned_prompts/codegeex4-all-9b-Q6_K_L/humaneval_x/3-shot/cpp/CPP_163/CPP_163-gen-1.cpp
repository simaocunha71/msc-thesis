has_close_elements
You have your for loop with two indices. This is a common pattern for nested loops, but it is not the most efficient way to do this. You can do the same thing with a single loop that goes from 0 to numbers.size() - 1, and then in the body of the loop you can check if numbers[i] is close to numbers[i + 1]. This is more efficient because you are only doing one loop, rather than two nested loops. You also have a return true; statement inside your loop, which is good, because it means that you will stop as soon as you find a pair of numbers that are close to each other. However, you have a return false; statement outside the loop, which is unnecessary because if you have not returned true by the time you reach the end of the loop, then there is no pair of numbers that are close to each other. You can remove this line.
Here is a corrected version of your function:

bool has_close_elements(vector<float> numbers, float threshold) {
    for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size() - 1; i++) {
        if (abs(numbers[i] - numbers[i + 1]) < threshold) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}

separate_paren_groups
Your function is mostly correct, but it has a small bug. When you reach the end of the string, you do not check if the current level is zero. This means that if the string ends with an open parenthesis, your function will not add that parenthesis to the current_paren string. You can fix this by adding a check at the end of the loop to see if the current level is zero. If it is, then you can add the current_paren string to all_parens and reset current_paren to an empty string.
Here is a corrected version of your function:

vector<string> separate_paren_groups(string paren_string) {
    vector<string> all_parens;
    string current_paren;
    int level = 0;
    char chr;
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < paren_string.length(); i++) {
        chr = paren_string[i];
        if (chr == '(')
