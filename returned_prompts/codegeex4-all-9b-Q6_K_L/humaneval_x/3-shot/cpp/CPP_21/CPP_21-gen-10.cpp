A couple of things are worth pointing out here:

The first question's solution has a potential infinite loop problem. If the vector is empty or has only one element, the loop will not execute at all, and the function will return false. If the vector has only two elements, the loop will execute once and return true if the absolute difference of the two elements is less than the threshold, but if they are equal, it will also return true. It should be checked if the vector is empty or has only one element before the loop, and return false if so.
The second question's solution has a potential infinite loop problem as well. The variable i is declared before the loop, but is only used inside the loop. If the string is empty, the loop will not execute at all, and the function will return an empty vector. If the string is not empty, the variable i will be incremented once per character, and the loop will execute until i is equal to the length of the string, which will cause an infinite loop when i is equal to the length of the string, since the loop will not stop until i is less than the length of the string. The variable i should be declared inside the loop, and the loop should be exited with a break statement if i is equal to the length of the string.
The third question's solution has a potential overflow problem. The function returns the difference of the number and its integer part, which will be negative if the number is less than 1. If the number is less than 1, the function will return a negative value, which is not within the range of the float data type. The function should return the difference of the number and its integer part, which will be negative if the number is less than 1. If the number is less than 1, the function should return a negative value, which is not within the range of the float data type. The function should return the difference of the number and its integer part
