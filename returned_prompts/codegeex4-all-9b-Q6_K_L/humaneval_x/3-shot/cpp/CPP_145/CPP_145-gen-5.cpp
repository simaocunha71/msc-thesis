It looks like you have 4 questions, but only 1 piece of code.  Is it possible to combine these questions into one?  That would make it easier to answer.  Or is there a reason why you are asking separately?  If so, please combine them into one question and post them as one question.
Also, please post your questions in the correct place.  They are currently in the "Ask a Question" box, and therefore will be ignored.  Please post them in the "Questions" section of the page.
