Firstly, this is not a C++ code. You can't use "using namespace std;" in C++ code. It is a C++11 feature.
Secondly, the code style is not standard. Please try to use 4 spaces for a tab, and please do not use // for comment in C++. Use /* and */ for comment in C++.
Thirdly, the code is not commented. The code should be commented, and the comment should be meaningful.
Fourthly, the code is not indented properly. The code should be indented properly.
Fifthly, the code is not good for performance. For example, the code in the has_close_elements function has a time complexity of O(n^2), which is not good for performance. The code can be improved by using a hash map to store the numbers, and then check if there is a number in the hash map whose difference with the current number is smaller than the threshold.
Sixthly, the code is not good for readability. For example, the code in the separate_paren_groups function has a lot of variables, which is not good for readability. The code can be improved by using a single variable for the current_paren and the level.
Seventhly, the code is not good for maintainability. For example, the code in the truncate_number function has a lot of code, which is not good for maintainability. The code can be improved by using a single return statement.
Eighthly, the code is not good for error handling. For example, the code in the order_by_points function has a lot of code, which is not good for error handling. The code can be improved by using a try-catch block.
Ninthly, the code is not good for security. For example, the code in the separate_paren_groups function has a lot of code, which is not good for security. The code can be improved by using a secure function for the current_paren and the level.
Tenthly, the code is not good for usability. For example, the code in the separate_paren_groups function has a lot of
