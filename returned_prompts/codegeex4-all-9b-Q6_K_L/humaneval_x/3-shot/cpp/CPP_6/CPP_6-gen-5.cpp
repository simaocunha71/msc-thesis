You're using C++11. This is good, but you're not using all of its features. For example, you're using std::vector in your functions, but you're not using a range-based for loop. You're also not using std::abs, which is part of the C++ standard library.

This function is very inefficient. You're using a double nested loop, which means that its time complexity is O(n^2). This is not acceptable for large n. Instead, you should sort the vector and then check for close elements in linear time. This can be done using std::sort and a single loop.

Your function for parsing nested parentheses is not correct. It will not correctly handle strings that contain spaces. For example, if the string is "((())) () ((())()())", your function will return {2, 3, 1, 3}, but the correct answer is {3, 3, 1, 3}. You should use std::stringstream to parse the string.

Your function for truncating a number is not correct. It will not correctly handle negative numbers. For example, if the number is -3.5, your function will return 0.5, but the correct answer is -0.5. You should use std::modf to truncate a number.

Here is the corrected code:
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <sstream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

bool has_close_elements(vector<float> numbers, float threshold){
    sort(numbers.begin(), numbers.end());
    for (size_t i = 0; i < numbers.size() - 1; ++i) {
        if (abs(numbers[i + 1] - numbers[i]) < threshold) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}

vector<string> separate_paren_groups(string paren_string){
    vector<string
