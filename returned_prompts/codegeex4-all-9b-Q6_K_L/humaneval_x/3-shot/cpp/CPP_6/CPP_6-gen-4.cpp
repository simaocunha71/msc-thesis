Avoid using namespace std
Use std::abs instead of abs
Use std::vector instead of vector
Avoid using std::endl
Use std::string instead of string
Use std::stoi instead of stoi
Use std::stof instead of stof
Use std::to_string instead of to_string

Overall, the code looks clean, however, I would suggest to add comments to explain the logic behind the code.
