The first function is correct. It's properly using the abs function to calculate the absolute value of the difference between the two elements and then compares that value to the threshold. If the value is less than the threshold, it returns true and if the value is greater than the threshold, it returns false.
The second function is correct. It's properly using a string to keep track of the current parenthetical group and pushes it to the vector when the level is 0. It also correctly ignores any spaces in the input string.
The third function is correct. It's properly calculating the decimal part of the number by subtracting the integer part from the original number.
The fourth function is correct. It's properly using the given operators and operands to build the algebraic expression and then evaluates that expression correctly. It also correctly handles the case where there are multiple operators and operands.
