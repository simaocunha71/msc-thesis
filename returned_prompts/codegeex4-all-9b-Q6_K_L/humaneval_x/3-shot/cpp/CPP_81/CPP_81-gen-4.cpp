Your has_close_elements function works, but it has a problem: the comparison abs(numbers[i]-numbers[j])<threshold is only checking that the two numbers are closer than the threshold, not that all pairs are closer than the threshold. If you change it to return false after finding one pair, it will work correctly.
The separate_paren_groups function is also fine, but it could be made more efficient by keeping track of the start and end indices of each group rather than building the strings. You could then just return a vector of substrings using those indices.
The truncate_number function is simple and works correctly.
The numerical_letter_grade function is also fine, but it could be made more efficient by using a switch statement instead of a series of if-else statements.
