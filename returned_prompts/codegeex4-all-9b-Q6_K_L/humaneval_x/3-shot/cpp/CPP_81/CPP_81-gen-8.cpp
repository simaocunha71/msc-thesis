You are not doing any kind of testing of your functions. Try writing a main function and test your code. For example:
int main() {
    // Test your functions here
    return 0;
}

The code above is a skeleton for your main function. You can add as many tests as you want, for example:
int main() {
    vector<float> numbers = {1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5
