There are a few issues with this function.
First, the A: comment is not necessary. It is a common practice to comment out code with the //TODO: comment, but that is not needed here.
Second, you should use the standard library function std::abs for calculating the absolute value. There is no reason to use abs from math.h.
Third, your function should be a const member function because it does not modify any member variables. You should add the const qualifier to the end of your function signature.
Lastly, the function name could be more descriptive. The name has_close_elements does not tell me what the function does. I would change it to something like has_within_threshold.
Here's a revised version of your function:
bool has_within_threshold(const std::vector<float>& numbers, float threshold) const {
    for (size_t i = 0; i < numbers.size(); ++i) {
        for (size_t j = i + 1; j < numbers.size(); ++j) {
            if (std::abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold) {
                return
