This is a good start.  Your functions are mostly well written, but there are a few issues with formatting, and some comments that could be improved.

has_close_elements

First off, the name of this function is not very descriptive.  It's not immediately clear what this function is supposed to do.  It might be helpful to rename it to something like "are_any_numbers_closer_than_threshold".
Your function is well written, and it's not bad at all.  However, there are a few things that could be improved.

The comment at the top of the function could be improved.  It's good to have comments, but they should be helpful.  In this case, the comment doesn't really tell me anything about how the function works, or what it's supposed to do.
The function could be made more efficient.  Right now, it's checking every pair of numbers in the vector, but it only needs to check adjacent pairs.  This could be done by iterating over the vector with a step of 2.
The function could be made more readable by breaking it up into smaller functions.  For example, you could create a function that calculates the absolute difference between two numbers, and then use that function in your main function.

The function could be made more efficient.  Right now, it's iterating over the entire string, but it only needs to iterate over the characters that are actually parentheses.
The function could be made more readable by breaking it up into smaller functions.  For example, you could create a function that checks if a character is a parenthesis, and then use that function in your main function.
