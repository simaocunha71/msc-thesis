The first question is asking for the distance between any two numbers, not the sum. You could use the function std::distance to find the distance between two iterators, then you can use std::abs to get the absolute value of the difference.
Also, the standard library provides std::abs, you do not need to use math.h.
You also should not use the name i and j for loop variables. It is a bad practice to use the same names for loop variables and for other variables. In this case, you are reusing the loop variables for the arguments of std::distance. That is very confusing.
The second question is asking for the string between the parentheses. You could use std::string::find to find the positions of the parentheses, then you can use std::string::substr to extract the substring between the parentheses. You could use std::string::find_first_of and std::string::find_last_of to find the positions of the parentheses. Also, you should not use the same variable name chr for the character and the string. That is very confusing.
The third question is asking for the decimal part of the number. You can use the modulus operator (%) to get the remainder of the division of the number by 1.0. You could use std::fmod to get the remainder of the division of the number by 1.0.
The fourth question is asking for the n-th element of the fib4 number sequence. You can use a loop to compute the n-th element of the fib4 number sequence. You could use std::vector to store the elements of the fib4 number sequence. Also, you should not use the name n for the loop variable. It is a bad practice to use the same name for loop variables and for other variables. In this case, you are reusing the loop variable for the argument of the function. That is very confusing.
