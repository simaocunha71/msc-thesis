Your function names are not descriptive. You should have something like:
bool has_close_elements(vector<float> numbers, float threshold)
bool separate_paren_groups(string paren_string)
float truncate_number(float number)
int fib4(int n)

or, better yet,
bool are_close_elements(vector<float> numbers, float threshold)
bool separate_balanced_paren_groups(string paren_string)
float fractional_part(float number)
int fib4(int n)

Your question doesn't specify how your function should behave if the input string is not properly balanced. It seems like you should throw an exception or otherwise return some kind of error. Currently, your code will silently return an empty vector if there are unmatched parentheses.
Your code does not handle the case where the input string is empty. This will cause an out-of-bounds access. You should either add code to handle this case or throw an exception.
Your code does not handle the case where the input string contains spaces. This will cause an out-of-bounds access. You should either add code to handle this case or throw an exception.
Your code does not handle the case where the input string contains non-parenthesis characters. This will cause an out-of-bounds access. You should either add code to handle this case or throw an exception.
Your code does not handle the case where the input number is negative. This will cause an out-of-bounds access. You should either add code to handle this case or throw an exception.
Your code does not handle the case where the input number is not a finite floating point number. This will cause an undefined behavior. You should either add code to handle this case or throw an exception.
Your code does not handle the case where the input number is not a floating point number. This will cause an undefined behavior. You should either add code to handle this case or throw an exception.
Your code does not handle the case where the input number is NaN. This will cause an undefined behavior. You should either add code to handle this case or throw an exception.
Your code does not handle the case where the input
