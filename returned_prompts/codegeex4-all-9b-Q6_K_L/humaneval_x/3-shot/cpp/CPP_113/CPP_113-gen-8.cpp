Your first problem is that you are using a hard-coded return value.  Instead, you should be using the return statement to return the value that you computed.  So, change this:
return true;

to this:
return true;

Your second problem is that you are not handling the case where there are no numbers in the vector.  In that case, you should return false.  Add this to the top of your function:
if (numbers.size() < 2) {
    return false;
}

The third problem is that you are not checking the case where the threshold is negative.  In that case, you should return false.  Add this to the top of your function:
if (threshold < 0) {
    return false;
}

And finally, you are not using the return statement to return the value that you computed.  Instead, you are using a goto statement.  Remove the goto statement and change this:
goto A;

to this:
return false;

Your second problem is that you are not checking that the input string is well-formed.  In other words, you are not checking that every opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis.  Add this to the top of your function:
int level = 0;
for (char c : paren_string) {
    if (c == '(') {
        ++level;
    } else if (c == ')') {
        --level;
    }
    if (level < 0) {
        return vector<string>();
    }
}
if (level != 0) {
    return vector<string>();
}

Your third problem is that you are not checking that the input string is well-formed.  In other words, you are not checking that every opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis.  Add this to the top of your function:
if (number < 0) {
    return number;
}

Your fourth problem is that you are not checking that the input string is well-formed.  In other words, you are not checking that every opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis.
