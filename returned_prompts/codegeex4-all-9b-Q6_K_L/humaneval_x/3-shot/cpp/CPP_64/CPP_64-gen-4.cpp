First of all, I would like to point out that the way your code is formatted is not very readable. I'm not sure if that's just a matter of personal taste or if you're following some kind of code style guide, but I would suggest to use a different one. For example, this one: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style
Also, the naming of your functions and variables is quite bad. Your code is very long, so I can't read all of it, but I can see that you're using the same variable names in different functions, which is not good practice. Also, the function names are not descriptive enough. It would be much better if they would tell you exactly what the function does.
Now, let's talk about the code itself. 

In the has_close_elements function, you're using a nested for loop to compare every pair of numbers. This is not the most efficient way to do it. You can use a single loop and keep track of the minimum difference you've seen so far. If you find a pair of numbers with a difference smaller than the threshold, you can return true immediately. This would reduce the time complexity of your function from O(n^2) to O(n), which is a big improvement.

In the separate_paren_groups function, you're using a for loop to iterate over the characters of the string. This is fine, but you're also using a while loop inside it, which is not necessary. You can just use a single loop and keep track of the current level of nested parentheses. If you find a closing parenthesis and the level is 0, you can add the current group to the vector of groups and start a new group. This would simplify your code and make it more efficient.

In the truncate_number function, you're using the int() function to truncate the number. This is not a good idea because it will only work with integers. If you want to truncate a floating-point number, you should use the floor() function. This would make your function more general and correct.

In the vowels_count function, you're using the find() function to check if
