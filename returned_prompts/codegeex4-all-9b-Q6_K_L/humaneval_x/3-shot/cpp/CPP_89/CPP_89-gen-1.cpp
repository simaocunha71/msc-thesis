Here are some comments on your code:

In your first function, you are using a label named A, but it is not clear to me what it is intended to do.  If you are using it to break out of the nested for loop, then you should use a break statement instead.  If you are trying to break out of the function, then you should use a return statement.  If you are trying to break out of the inner loop only, then you should use a continue statement.
In your second function, you are not checking for an empty string.  If the input string is empty, then the loop will not execute, and the function will return an empty vector.  This is likely not what you intended.
In your third function, you are using the floor function to truncate the number.  However, the floor function returns the largest integer less than or equal to its argument, so it will not truncate the number as you intended.  Instead, you should use the fmod function to get the remainder of the division, which will give you the decimal part of the number.
In your fourth function, you are using a for loop to iterate through the string and shift the letters.  However, you are not checking whether the letter is a lowercase letter or an uppercase letter.  This will cause problems if the input string contains non-letter characters.  You should use the islower and isupper functions to check the case of each character before shifting it.  Also, you are shifting the letters by 4, but you should shift them by 4 times 2, which is 8, to meet the requirements of the problem.  Finally, you are not checking for letters that would be shifted past 'z' or 'Z'.  You should use the tolower and toupper functions to convert the letters to lowercase or uppercase before shifting them, and then convert them back to their original case after shifting.
