There are a few things that could be improved, especially with the provided code. 

Avoid using namespace std;

This is generally bad practice as it can lead to name clashes. I suggest you read about it more.

Use of magic numbers

In your encrypt function, you are using the number 4 to shift the character in the alphabet. It is better practice to use a named constant instead. This also makes your code more readable. 

Use of global variables

In your encrypt function, you are using a for loop that is dependent on a global variable i. It is generally better practice to avoid using global variables as it can lead to bugs and makes your code harder to understand.

Use of char instead of string

In your encrypt function, you are using a char variable to store the character you are encrypting. It is generally better practice to use a string variable to store the encrypted string. 

Use of abs function

In your has_close_elements function, you are using the abs function to find the absolute value of the difference between two numbers. It is generally better practice to use the fabs function instead. 

Use of math.h library

In your truncate_number function, you are using the math.h library to find the integer part of a number. It is generally better practice to use the floor function instead. 

Use of vector instead of array

In your separate_paren_groups function, you are using a vector to store the parentheses. It is generally better practice to use an array instead. 

Use of string instead of char

In your separate_paren_groups function, you are using a string to store the current parentheses. It is generally better practice to use a char instead. 

Use of push_back function

In your separate_paren_groups function, you are using the push_back function to add an element to the vector. It is generally better practice to use the append function instead. 

Use of length
