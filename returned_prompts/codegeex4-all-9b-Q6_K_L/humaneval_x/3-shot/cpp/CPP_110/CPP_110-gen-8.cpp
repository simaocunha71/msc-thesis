The first function (has_close_elements) looks correct. It iterates through all pairs of numbers and checks if they are within the threshold.
The second function (separate_paren_groups) is mostly correct, but it doesn't handle the case where there are spaces in the input string. You should remove the spaces before processing the string.
The third function (truncate_number) is correct.
The fourth function (exchange) is mostly correct, but it doesn't handle the case where lst1 already contains only even numbers. You should check if lst1 already contains only even numbers before returning "YES".
