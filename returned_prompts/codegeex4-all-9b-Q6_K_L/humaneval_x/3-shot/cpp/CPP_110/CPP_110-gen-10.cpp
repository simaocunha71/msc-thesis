The first thing I see is that your question does not match your code.  It appears that you have a single question and a set of answers, but the question is not the first thing in the list, and the answers are not labeled with the question number.  It may be that you have omitted the first question (which is a bit odd, as the first question is generally the most important), or that you have omitted the question number from your answers.  But as it stands, it is hard to follow the order of your questions and answers.
In the second question, you use a for loop with a range that includes the end value of the range.  This is not a problem, but it is unconventional.  Normally, you would use a for loop with a range that does not include the end value of the range.  This is because the loop variable is initialized to the start value of the range, and then incremented until it reaches the end value of the range.  If the end value of the range is included, then the loop variable will be incremented one time too many, and the loop will run one time too long.  In this case, however, the end value of the range is not included, so this is not a problem.
In the third question, you use the abs function to compute the absolute value of a floating point number.  This is correct, but it is not the most efficient way to do it.  The abs function is a function that is defined in the math library, and it takes a single argument.  This means that it will have to copy the argument to the function, compute the absolute value, and then copy the result back.  This is more work than it needs to be.  A more efficient way to compute the absolute
