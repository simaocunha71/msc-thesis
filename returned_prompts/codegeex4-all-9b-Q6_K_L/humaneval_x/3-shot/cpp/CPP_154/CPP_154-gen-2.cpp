This is your first attempt at a programming language.  Congrats!  Please don't feel discouraged.  This is a lot to take in, especially at first, but once you get a handle on the concepts, it will all start to make sense.
This is your first attempt at C++.  This is a great language to start with, but it's not the best.  C++ is a big, complex language with a lot of features.  It's also a language that requires a lot of boilerplate code to accomplish even simple tasks.  There are other languages that are simpler and more intuitive, like Python or Java.  These languages have fewer features, but they are easier to learn and use.

Your first problem is to check if two numbers in a vector are closer to each other than a given threshold.  Here's the code you wrote:

```cpp
bool has_close_elements(vector<float> numbers, float threshold){
    int i,j;
    for (i=0;i<numbers.size();i++)
        for (j=i+1;j<numbers.size();j++)
            if (abs(numbers[i]-numbers[j])<threshold)
                return true;
    return false;
}
```

This code is mostly correct, but it has a few issues.  First, it's not using the `std::abs` function correctly.  The `std::abs` function takes an `int` or a `float` as an argument, but it doesn't take a `vector<float>` as an argument.  You should be using `abs(numbers[i]-numbers[j])` instead of `abs(numbers[i]-numbers[j])`.  Second, your code is not using the `std::vector` class correctly.  The `std::vector` class has a `size()` function that returns the number of elements in the vector, but it doesn't have a `length()` function.  You should be using `numbers.size()` instead of `numbers.length()`.  Third, your code is not using the `std::vector` class correctly.  The `std
