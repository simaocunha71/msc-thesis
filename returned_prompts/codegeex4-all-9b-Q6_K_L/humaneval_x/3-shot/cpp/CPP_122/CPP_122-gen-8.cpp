Your has_close_elements function doesn't work as expected. It is because your loop condition i < numbers.size() and j < numbers.size(). That means you are comparing two numbers with each other. But in your question you have mentioned that you want to compare all the numbers in the array. So you need to remove the inner loop and compare all the numbers with each other. Here is the updated code:

bool has_close_elements(vector<float> numbers, float threshold){

    for (int i=0;i<numbers.size();i++)
    for (int j=i+1;j<numbers.size();j++)
    if (abs(numbers[i]-numbers[j])<threshold)
    return true;

    return false;
}

Your separate_paren_groups function is fine. Just remember to handle the edge case when the input string is empty. You can do this by adding a condition at the beginning of the function:

vector<string> separate_paren_groups(string paren_string){

    if(paren_string.empty()) {
        return {};
    }
    vector<string> all_parens;
    string current_paren;
    int level=0;
    char chr;
    int i;
    for (i=0;i<paren_string.length();i++)
    {
        chr=paren_string[i];
        if (chr=='(')
        {
        level+=1;
        current_paren+=chr;
        }
        if (chr==')')
        {
            level-=1;
            current_paren+=chr;
            if (level==0){
                all_parens.push_back(current_paren);
                current_paren="";
            }
        }
    }
    return all_parens;
}

Your truncate_number function is also fine. Just remember to handle the edge case when the input number is negative. You can do this by adding a condition at the beginning of the function:

float truncate_number(float number){

    if(number < 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    return number - int(number);
}

Your add_elements function is fine. Just remember to handle the edge case when the input vector is empty or k is greater than the size of the vector. You can do this by adding a condition at the beginning of the function:

int add_elements(vector<int> arr,int k){

    if(arr.empty() || k > arr.size())
