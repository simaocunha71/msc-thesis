The questions are all pretty good and the solutions are mostly correct, but there are a few issues with them:

In the first question, the solution is not very efficient. It has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the vector. This is because the solution uses two nested loops to compare all pairs of elements. A more efficient solution would be to sort the vector and then iterate through it once, keeping track of the minimum difference seen so far. This would have a time complexity of O(n log n).
In the second question, the solution does not handle the case where the input string does not contain any parentheses. In this case, the function should return an empty vector. The solution also does not handle the case where the input string contains unmatched parentheses. In this case, the function should return an empty vector. The solution also does not handle the case where the input string contains spaces. The function should ignore these spaces.
In the third question, the solution is correct, but it is not very efficient. It has a time complexity of O(1), but it uses a lot of memory to store the result. A more efficient solution would be to return the remainder of the number when divided by 1. This would have a time complexity of O(1) and use less memory.
In the fourth question, the solution is not very efficient. It has a time complexity of O(k), where k is the number of elements in the vector. This is because the solution uses a loop to iterate through the first k elements of the vector. A more efficient solution would be to use a stack to keep track of the elements seen so far. This would have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the vector.

Here is an improved version of each of the solutions:

First question:

```cpp
#include<algorithm>
#include<vector>
using namespace std;
bool has_close_elements(vector<float> numbers, float threshold){
    sort(numbers.begin(), numbers.end());
    for (int i = 1; i < numbers.size(); i++){
        if (numbers[i] - numbers[i-1] < threshold){
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

Second question:

```cpp
#include<vector>
#include<string
