In the first problem, the solution is correct. But, it's not efficient. The complexity is O(n^2). You can solve it in a more efficient way (O(n)).
Instead of checking all the elements, you can sort the array and then check the difference of consecutive elements.
You can use the STL sort function to sort the array. Then, you can check the difference of consecutive elements and if the difference is smaller than threshold return true.
You can use the STL next_permutation function to generate all the permutations of the array. Then, you can check the difference of consecutive elements and if the difference is smaller than threshold return true.
