1. has_close_elements
Your loop only checks adjacent elements, so if two numbers are close but not adjacent, they won't be detected. You can fix this by changing the condition in the if statement to:
if (abs(numbers[i]-numbers[j]) < threshold)
    return true;

2. separate_paren_groups
Your function is almost correct, but it fails to handle empty groups. To fix this, you can add a check for an empty current_paren before adding it to all_parens:
if (level == 0 && !current_paren.empty()) {
    all_parens.push_back(current_paren);
    current_paren = "";
}

3. truncate_number
The function is correct, but it can be simplified using the fmod function:
return fmod(number, 1);

4. circular_shift
Your function is correct, but it can be simplified using the string::substr function:
string new_str = str.substr(str.length() - shift) + str.substr(0, str.length() - shift);

Overall, your code is mostly correct, but there are some minor issues that can be fixed.
