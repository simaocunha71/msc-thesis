You have some good code in your question, but it's not commented. Comments are the single most important thing in code. They help you remember what you were doing, they help your team understand what you were doing, and they help future you remember what you were doing. Comments should be concise and descriptive of the code that follows them. They should not be a substitute for good code, but they should be used to make the code more understandable.

Your code is C++, but you're using C-style for loops and stdio.h. You should be using the C++ standard library, which has its own versions of the for loop and input/output functions. Also, you don't need to use math.h to use abs, because the standard library has its own version of abs in the cmath header.

Your has_close_elements function is a bit confusing. You're using a nested for loop to compare every pair of numbers, but you could use a single for loop to do the same thing. Also, you're using an absolute value function, but you don't need to because the std::abs function already returns a positive number.

Your separate_paren_groups function is also a bit confusing. You're using a for loop to iterate over the string, but you could use a while loop to do the same thing. Also, you're using a char variable to store each character, but you don't need to because the std::string type can be used directly.

Your truncate_number function is also a bit confusing. You're using a cast to int to truncate the number, but you could use the std::floor function to do the same thing.

Your circular_shift function is also a bit confusing. You're using a cast to string to convert the integer to a string, but you could use the std::to_string function to do the same thing. Also, you're using a for loop to iterate over the string, but you could use a while loop to do the same thing.
