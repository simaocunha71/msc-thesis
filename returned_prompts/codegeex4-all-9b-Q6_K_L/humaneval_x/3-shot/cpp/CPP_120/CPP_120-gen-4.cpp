For the first question, there are two issues:

You've declared i and j as variables inside the function, but you're not using them. This is not an error, but it's bad practice to declare variables that you're not going to use.
The check for whether two numbers are within a given threshold of each other is correct, but you're not returning anything if they are. You should return false if they are not within the threshold.

Here's the corrected code:

```c++
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

bool has_close_elements(vector<float> numbers, float threshold) {
    for (size_t i = 0; i < numbers.size(); ++i) {
        for (size_t j = i + 1; j < numbers.size(); ++j) {
            if (abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold) {
                return true;
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

For the second question, you're using a for loop to iterate over the characters in the string, but you're not checking if the character is a space before adding it to the current_paren string. You should add a check to see if the character is a space and skip it if it is.

Here's the corrected code:

```c++
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

vector<string> separate_paren_groups(string paren_string) {
    vector<string> all_parens;
    string current_paren;
    int level = 0;
    char chr;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < paren_string.length(); ++i) {
        chr = paren_string[i];
        if (chr == '(') {
            level += 1;
            current_paren += chr;
        } else if (chr == ')') {
            level -= 1;
            current_paren += chr;
            if (level == 0) {
                all_parens.push_back(current_paren);
                current_paren = "";
            }
        }
    }
    return all_parens;
}
```

For the third question, you're using the int() function to convert the number to an integer, but this will truncate the decimal part of the number. Instead, you should use the floor
