The first function looks pretty good.  It has good use of the for loop and the vector, and the algorithm is straightforward.  There is one potential issue with it, though:  It uses a label (A:) which is not a good practice.  Labels are a holdover from the early days of programming when goto statements were popular, and they are generally considered harmful.  They make code harder to read and maintain, and they can cause bugs if not used carefully.  In this case, you could simply remove the label and the code would work just as well.

The second function has a bug.  It does not correctly handle the case where there are multiple groups of parentheses that are balanced but not nested within each other.  For example, if the input string is "((()))", the function will return {"()", "()", "()", "()"}, which is incorrect.  To fix this, you could modify the code to keep track of the current group of parentheses, and only add it to the vector when you encounter a closing parenthesis that matches the opening parenthesis.

The third function is correct, but it could be made more efficient.  Instead of using the floor function to truncate the number, you could simply cast the number to an integer, which will automatically discard the decimal part.  This will be faster and more accurate.

The fourth function is also correct, but it could be made more efficient.  Instead of using three nested loops to iterate over all possible triples, you could use a single loop to iterate over all possible pairs, and then calculate the third element based on the sum of the first two.  This will reduce the number of iterations from n^3 to n^2, which could be a significant improvement for large values of n.
