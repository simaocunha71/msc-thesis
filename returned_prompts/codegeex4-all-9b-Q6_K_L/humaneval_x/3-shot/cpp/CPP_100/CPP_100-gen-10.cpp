The questions are clear and the answers are mostly correct. I would like to make the following suggestions:

In the has_close_elements function you have a label A which is not used. This is not a problem, but it's not needed.
In the separate_paren_groups function, your code is correct. However, there is a bug in your code, which is that it does not check that the parenthesis are balanced. For example, the input string "( ) (( )) (( )( ) " would return {"()", "(())", "(()())"} which is incorrect. To fix this, you need to add a check that the number of opening and closing parentheses are equal.
In the truncate_number function, your code is correct.
In the make_a_pile function, your code is correct, but it has a bug. The number of stones in the next level should be the next odd number if n is odd, and the next even number if n is even. However, your code always adds 2 to the current_stones. This is incorrect. To fix this, you need to add a check that n is odd or even and then add the appropriate number to current_stones.

Here is the corrected code:

bool has_close_elements(vector<float> numbers, float threshold){
    int i,j;

    for (i=0;i<numbers.size();i++)
        for (j=i+1;j<numbers.size();j++)
            if (abs(numbers[i]-numbers[j])<threshold)
                return true;

    return false;
}

vector<string> separate_paren_groups(string paren_string){
    vector<string> all_parens;
    string current_paren;
    int level=0;
    char chr;
    int i;
    for (i=0;i<paren_string.length();i++)
    {
        chr=paren_string[i];
        if (chr=='(')
        {
            level+=1;
            current_paren+=chr;
        }
        if (chr==')')
        {
            level-=1;
            current_paren+=chr;
            if (level==0){
                all_parens.push_back(current
