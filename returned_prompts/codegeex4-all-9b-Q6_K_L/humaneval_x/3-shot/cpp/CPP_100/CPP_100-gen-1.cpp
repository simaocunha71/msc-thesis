1) has_close_elements
This is a simple nested loop problem. You have to check every element in the array against every other element. If the difference between the two is less than the threshold, return true. If you finish the loop without finding any pairs that meet the condition, return false.
2) separate_paren_groups
For this function, you need to keep track of the current group of parentheses and the level of nesting you're currently in. You start at level 0, and increment the level every time you encounter an open parenthesis and decrement the level every time you encounter a close parenthesis. When the level goes back down to 0, you have completed a group and can add it to the vector.
3) truncate_number
This function is essentially asking you to find the decimal portion of the number. You can subtract the integer portion from the original number to get the decimal portion.
4) make_a_pile
This function is a simple pattern recognition problem. The pattern is that the number of stones in each level is the next odd number if the input number is odd, or the next even number if the input number is even. You can generate this pattern by using a loop and adding 2 to the previous number in the sequence.
