First, the code looks good, but there are a couple of things that could be improved.

Q1: has_close_elements
Your function takes a vector of float values, but you use int variables to loop through the vector. The loop condition should be changed to:
for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++)
for (int j = i + 1; j < numbers.size(); j++)

Q2: separate_paren_groups
You do not need to check for level == 0 in the loop. You can simply push the current_paren into the all_parens vector when you encounter a closing parenthesis. This makes the code cleaner and easier to read. Here's the improved version:
for (int i = 0; i < paren_string.length(); i++)
{
    chr = paren_string[i];
    if (chr == '(')
    {
        current_paren += chr;
        level += 1;
    }
    else if (chr == ')')
    {
        current_paren += chr;
        level -= 1;
        if (level == 0)
        {
            all_parens.push_back(current_paren);
            current_paren = "";
        }
    }
}

Q3: truncate_number
Your function returns the decimal part of the number by subtracting the integer part from the original number. This is correct, but you can simplify the code by using the fmod function from the math library. Here's the improved version:
return fmod(number, 1.0f);

Q4: check_if_last_char_is_a_letter
Your function checks if the last character is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word. However, there is a bug in your code. You are checking if the character before the last character is a space, but you should be checking if the character after the last character is a space. Here's the improved version:
if ((chr >= 'a' && chr <= 'z') || (chr >= 'A' &&
