In the separate_paren_groups function, you are assuming that the string always starts with an opening parenthesis. This is not necessarily true, as the parentheses could be nested in an arbitrary way, or even empty. Your current code would fail in these cases. You need to check that the first character is an opening parenthesis before you start processing the string.
In the has_close_elements function, you are using a label A: and then jumping to it using goto. This is not a good practice, as it makes the code harder to read and understand. It would be better to simply remove the label and the goto statement, and let the function return the result directly.
In the truncate_number function, you are using the int() function to convert the floating point number to an integer. However, this is not the correct way to truncate a floating point number. You should use the floor() function from the math library instead.
In the check_if_last_char_is_a_letter function, you are using a loop to count the number of spaces in the string. This is not the most efficient way to check if the last character is a letter. You can simply check if the last character is not a space, and then check if it is a letter.
Here is a corrected version of the separate_paren_groups function:
vector<string> separate_paren_groups(string paren_string){
    vector<string> all_parens;
    string current_paren;
    int level=0;
    char chr;
    int i;
    if (paren_string.length() > 0 && paren_string[0] == '(') {
        for (i=0;i<paren_string.length();i++){
            chr=paren_string[i];
            if (chr=='('){
                level+=1;
                current_paren+=chr;
            }
            if (chr==')'){
                level-=1;
                current_paren+=chr;
                if (level==0){
                    all_parens.push_back(current_paren);
                    current_paren="";
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return all_parens;
}

And here is a corrected version of the truncate_number function:
float truncate_number(float number){
    return number -
