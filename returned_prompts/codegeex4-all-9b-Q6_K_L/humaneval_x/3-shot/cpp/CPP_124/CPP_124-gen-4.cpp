has_close_elements()
The name has_close_elements() is a bit ambiguous. A more descriptive name might be has_close_floats_within_threshold(). Also, the function could be made more generic by taking a function pointer for the comparison, which would allow the user to define their own "close" function if necessary.
Also, I'd recommend using size_t for loop counters to avoid potential problems with signed vs. unsigned types.
separate_paren_groups()
The function name separate_paren_groups() is a bit misleading. It suggests that the function returns groups of parentheses, but it actually returns groups of strings containing parentheses. A more descriptive name might be separate_balanced_paren_groups().
The code could be simplified by using a stack to keep track of the parentheses, and then converting the stack to a string when an unbalanced parenthesis is found. This would eliminate the need for the level variable, the current_paren string, and the corresponding logic.
truncate_number()
The function name truncate_number() is a bit misleading. It suggests that the function truncates the number, but it actually returns the fractional part of the number. A more descriptive name might be get_fractional_part().
valid_date()
The function name valid_date() is a bit misleading. It suggests that the function validates a date, but it actually validates a date string. A more descriptive name might be validate_date_string().
The code could be simplified by using the standard library functions isdigit() and isalpha() to validate the date string. This would eliminate the need for the sscanf() and c_str() calls.
