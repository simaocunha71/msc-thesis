There are a few things you can work on in your code:
1. Use modern C++ standards: You are using c++11 features but you are not declaring them. So you should add this at the top of your file:
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

2. Use descriptive variable names: The variable names you are using are not descriptive enough. This makes it hard for someone else to understand what your code is doing. Use more descriptive names. For example:
for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++) // use a more descriptive name for i
for (int j = i + 1; j < numbers.size(); j++) // use a more descriptive name for j

3. Use functions to break up your code: Your code is a bit long, and it's hard to understand what's going on. You can break it up into smaller functions, each of which does one thing. For example:
bool has_close_elements(vector<float> numbers, float threshold) {
    // your code here
}

vector<string> separate_paren_groups(string paren_string) {
    // your code here
}

float truncate_number(float number) {
    // your code here
}

bool correct_bracketing(string brackets) {
    // your code here
}

4. Use comments to explain what your code is doing: Your code is not self-documenting. You should add comments to explain what each part of your code is doing. For example:
// This function checks if there are any two numbers in the given vector that are closer to each other than the given threshold.

5. Use return statements to return values: In your code, you are using return statements to return values, but you are not returning anything. You should use return statements to return values. For example:
return abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold; // return the result of the expression

6. Use curly braces to enclose your code blocks: In your code, you are using curly braces to enclose your code blocks, but you are not using them correctly. You should use curly braces to enclose your code blocks,
