has_close_elements()

Your code is overly complicated. The logic is simple: iterate through the vector, comparing each pair of elements. If you find two elements that are closer than the threshold, return true. If you reach the end of the loop without finding any such pair, return false.
You don't need to use a label (A) to break out of the loop. You can just return true when you find a pair that is closer than the threshold.
You don't need to use a level variable to track the nesting of parentheses. You can just count the number of open parentheses and decrement it when you find a close parenthesis. When the count reaches zero, you know you've reached the end of a group.

separate_paren_groups()

Your code is overly complicated. The logic is simple: iterate through the string, keeping track of the current group of parentheses and the nesting level. When you reach the end of a group, add it to the list of groups and start a new group. You don't need to use a level variable to track the nesting level. You can just count the number of open parentheses and decrement it when you find a close parenthesis. When the count reaches zero, you know you've reached the end of a group.

truncate_number()

Your code is correct. You are correctly returning the fractional part of the number by subtracting the integer part from the original number.

strange_sort_list()

Your code is correct. You are correctly sorting the vector, then iterating through it and inserting elements at the beginning of the output vector when the index is odd.
