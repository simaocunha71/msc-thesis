I'm not sure if there is a specific reason you are doing this, but I would recommend against doing it. This will cause you to lose the ability to use any of the features provided by the STL. It is also generally considered bad practice to use raw arrays in modern C++ programming. It is much safer and easier to use vectors. If you need to use raw arrays, then you should wrap them in a struct or class and use pointers to them. This will prevent you from accidentally overwriting memory. It is also much easier to manage the memory this way. You can use the new and delete operators to allocate and deallocate memory. You can also use the malloc and free functions to allocate and deallocate memory. However, I would recommend against using these functions because they are not as safe and they do not provide as much control over the memory. I would recommend using vectors instead. They are safer and they provide more control over the memory. They are also easier to use and they are more efficient. You can use the push_back and pop_back functions to add and remove elements from the vector. They are also easier to use and they are more efficient. You can use the size function to get the size of the vector. They are also easier to use and they are more efficient. You can use the resize function to change the size of the vector. They are also easier to use and they are more efficient. You can use the empty function to check if the vector is empty. They are also easier to use and they are more efficient. You can use the clear function to remove all elements from the vector. They are also easier to
