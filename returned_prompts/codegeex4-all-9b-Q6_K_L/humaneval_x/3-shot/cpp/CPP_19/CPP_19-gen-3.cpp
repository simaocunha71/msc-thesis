For the first problem, you can use a nested loop to compare each pair of numbers in the vector. If the absolute difference between any pair of numbers is less than the threshold, return true. Otherwise, return false.
For the second problem, you can iterate through the input string character by character. If you encounter an opening parenthesis, increment a counter. If you encounter a closing parenthesis, decrement the counter. If the counter reaches 0, you have found a balanced group of parentheses. Add this group to a vector and continue iterating until the end of the string. Return the vector of groups.
For the third problem, you can use the modulo operator (%) to find the decimal part of a number. The decimal part is the remainder when the number is divided by 1. Return this remainder.
For the fourth problem, you can use a map to store the mappings between number words and their corresponding numerical values. Iterate through the input string and split it into individual words. For each word, check if it exists in the map. If it does, retrieve its numerical value and add it to a vector. Sort the vector in ascending order and return the sorted string.

Here is the modified code:
#include<stdio.h>
#include<vector>
#include<math.h>
#include<string>
#include<map>
using namespace std;

bool has_close_elements(vector<float> numbers, float threshold){
    for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++){
        for (int j = i + 1; j < numbers.size(); j++){
