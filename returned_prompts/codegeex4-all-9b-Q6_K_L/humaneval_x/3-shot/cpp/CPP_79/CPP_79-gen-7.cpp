First, I must say that your answers are correct and they are correct in the right way. But, I will point out some possible improvements:
1. Naming
In the first function, the function name is "has_close_elements", which is fine, but the variable names are not very descriptive. In the second function, the variable names are not very descriptive either. For example, the variable name "chr" in the second function is not descriptive at all. And the variable name "level" in the second function is not very descriptive either. In the third function, the variable name "decimal_copy" is not very descriptive either. In the fourth function, the variable name "binary" is not very descriptive either. So, I would suggest renaming these variables to something more descriptive.
2. Code Style
In the first function, the code style is not consistent. For example, the variable names are not capitalized, but the function name is capitalized. In the second function, the code style is not consistent either. For example, the variable names are not capitalized, but the function name is capitalized. In the third function, the code style is not consistent either. For example, the variable names are not capitalized, but the function name is capitalized. In the fourth function, the code style is not consistent either. For example, the variable names are not capitalized, but the function name is capitalized. So, I would suggest making the code style consistent.
3. Comments
In the first function, the comments are not very descriptive. For example, the comment "Check if in given vector of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold." is not very descriptive. In the second function, the comments are not very descriptive either. For example, the comment "Input to this function is a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses. Your goal is to separate those group into separate strings and return the vector of those." is not very descriptive. In the third function, the comments are not very descriptive either. For example, the comment "Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into and integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals (leftover part
