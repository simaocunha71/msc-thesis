There are a few issues in your code, but let's first focus on style and code organization, then we can get into the actual code.
Firstly, let's make sure your code is properly organized. It's good to have your includes at the top of the file, and then your function definitions. In your case, you have everything in the same file, so that's fine, but make sure to comment your code properly. You're only using some of the standard library, so you can get rid of the others.
Secondly, your code is a bit messy. It's better to have a consistent style. I recommend using allman braces (which means placing braces on a new line, like you're doing). This is a matter of personal preference, but it's better to be consistent with the style you're using. I also recommend using more meaningful variable names. Your current variable names are fine, but they could be more descriptive.
Thirdly, your code could be more efficient. In your has_close_elements function, you're using a nested loop, which is fine, but it could be improved. You're not using any break statements, so the function will continue to check all pairs of numbers, even if it has already found a pair that is close enough. You could improve this by adding a break statement after you find a pair that is close enough.
Here's the updated code with all these changes:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <vector>
#include <math.h>
using namespace std;

bool has_close_elements(vector<float> numbers, float threshold) {
    for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < numbers.size(); j++) {
            if (abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold) {
                return true;
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}

vector<string> separate_paren_groups(string paren_string) {
    vector<string> all_parens;
    string current_paren;
    int level = 0;
    char chr;
    for (int i = 0; i < paren_string.length(); i++) {
        chr = paren_string[i
