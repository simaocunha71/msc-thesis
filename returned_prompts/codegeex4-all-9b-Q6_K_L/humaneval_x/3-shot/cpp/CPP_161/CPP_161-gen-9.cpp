Check if in given vector of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.

In the first question, you use the abs function correctly. However, you should use the fabs function instead, as it is a standard C library function. This is because the abs function is designed to work with integers, and may not work correctly with floating point numbers.

In the second question, your code is correct. You iterate over the string and check each character. If the character is a parenthesis, you increment or decrement the level variable. If the level variable is zero, you add the current_paren string to the all_parens vector and reset the current_paren string. Finally, you return the all_parens vector.

In the third question, your code is correct. You use the int function to truncate the number, which is the correct way to do it. However, you should also use the fmod function, as it is a standard C library function. This is because the int function is designed to work with integers, and may not work correctly with floating point numbers.

In the fourth question, your code is correct. You iterate over the string and check each character. If the character is a letter, you reverse its case. If the string contains no letters, you reverse the string. Finally, you return the string.

Overall, your code is correct and efficient. However, I would suggest using the standard C library functions fabs, fmod and isalpha instead of the abs, int and isalpha functions.
