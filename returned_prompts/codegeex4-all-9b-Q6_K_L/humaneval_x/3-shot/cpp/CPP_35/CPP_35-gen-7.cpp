I see a few things that could be improved.

You don't have to use the namespace std in the global scope of a .cpp file. If you don't have a forward declaration for std::vector in your header, you should declare it in your source file instead.
You're using the #include <math.h> header. This is C, not C++. You should use the C++ version of the math library: #include <cmath>.
Your for loops in has_close_elements have a bit of a weird syntax. You don't need to use a label, like A:. You can just use a regular for loop.
You're using the deprecated abs function. You should use std::abs instead.
Your for loop in separate_paren_groups can be a bit clearer if you use a range-based for loop.
You're using the deprecated math library functions. You should use the C++ math library functions instead. For example, use std::pow instead of pow.
Your max_element function can be a bit clearer if you use the standard library's std::max function.
You're using the deprecated math library functions. You should use the C++ math library functions instead. For example, use std::round instead of round.
You're using the deprecated math library functions. You should use the C++ math library functions instead. For example, use std::floor instead of floor.

Here's the refactored code:
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <cmath>

using std::vector;
using std::string;

bool has_close_elements(vector<float> numbers, float threshold) {
    for (auto it = numbers.begin(); it != numbers.end(); ++it) {
        for (auto it2 = it + 1; it2 != numbers.end(); ++it2) {
            if (std::abs(*it - *it2) < threshold) {
                return true;
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}

vector<string> separate_paren_groups(string paren_string) {
    vector<string> all_parens;
    string current_paren;
    int level = 0;
    for (char chr : paren_string) {
        if (chr == '(') {
            ++level;
            current_paren += chr;
        } else if (chr == ')') {
            --level;
