1. has_close_elements

Your code is not correct. The inner loop can iterate over the entire array, but it should only iterate up until the last element, not the second to last. You need to change your inner loop to:
for (j=i+1;j<numbers.size();j++)

2. separate_paren_groups

This function is fine, but you don't need to increment the level every time you encounter an open parenthesis. Instead, you can set the level to 1 when you encounter the first open parenthesis and then decrement it when you encounter a close parenthesis.

3. truncate_number

This function is fine, but it's not necessary to cast the integer part to float. You can simply return number - (int)number;

4. total_match

This function is fine, but you can make it more efficient by using a single loop to calculate the total number of characters in each list. Here's an example:
for (i=0;i<lst1.size();i++)
{
    sum1+=lst1[i].length();
}
for (i=0;i<lst2.size();i++)
{
    sum2+=lst2[i].length();
}

if (sum1<=sum2)
return lst1;
else
return lst2;
