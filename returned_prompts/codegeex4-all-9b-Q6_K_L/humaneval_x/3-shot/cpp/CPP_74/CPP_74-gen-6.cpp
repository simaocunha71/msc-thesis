Firstly, I'd like to say that your code is very clean and easy to read and understand. You use standard naming conventions, and your functions have meaningful names. 
Your code is also well-organized and easy to follow, with clear separation between functions and comments explaining what each function does. This makes it easy for others to understand your code, including yourself.
The only thing that I would suggest is to add more comments. While your code is easy to understand, it would be even easier if you added more comments explaining what each section of code does. This would help others to understand your code even better. 
In addition, you could consider adding some error checking. For example, in the separate_paren_groups function, you don't check if the parentheses are balanced. This could lead to unexpected results if the input string is not properly formatted. You could add some code to check for this, and return an error if it is not balanced. 
In general, your code is well-written and easy to understand. It would be even better if you added more comments and error checking.
