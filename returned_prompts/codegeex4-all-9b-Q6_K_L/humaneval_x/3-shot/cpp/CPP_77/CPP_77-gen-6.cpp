Your has_close_elements function has an off-by-one error in the range of the second loop. It should start from i + 1, not i.
Your separate_paren_groups function does not handle the case where the parentheses group ends at the end of the input string. It should check if the current level is 0 after processing the last character of the input string.
Your truncate_number function is incorrect. It returns the fractional part of the number, but it should return the integer part.
Your iscuber function is incorrect. It checks if the cube of the rounded cube root of the input number is equal to the input number, but it should check if the input number is equal to the cube of its integer part.
