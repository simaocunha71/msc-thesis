First, I want to say that the functions are mostly good. You've got a few minor issues and some room for improvement, but overall, your code is good.

1. You need to include <iostream> instead of <stdio.h> to use std::cout in your program.
2. You should always put your #include statements at the top of your program, before your using namespace std; statement.
3. You should always put your using namespace std; statement at the top of your program, before your function definitions.
4. You should always put your function definitions in the same order as they are called in your program.
5. Your has_close_elements function can be simplified by using the std::next function to get the next element in the vector.
6. Your separate_paren_groups function can be simplified by using a stack to keep track of the parentheses.
7. Your truncate_number function can be simplified by using the fmod function to get the remainder of the division.
8. Your any_int function can be simplified by using the std::abs function to get the absolute value of the numbers.

Here's the updated code:

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

bool has_close_elements(vector<float> numbers, float threshold){
    for (auto it = numbers.begin(); it != numbers.end(); ++it) {
        auto next = std::next(it);
        if (next != numbers.end() && abs(*it - *next) < threshold) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}

vector<string> separate_paren_groups(string paren_string){
    vector<string> all_parens;
    string current_paren;
    int level = 0;
    char chr;
    for (int i = 0; i < paren_string.length(); ++i) {
        chr = paren_string[i];
        if (chr == '(') {
            level += 1;
            current_paren += chr;
        } else if (chr == ')') {
            level -= 1;
            current_paren += chr;
            if (level == 0) {
                all_parens.push_back(current_paren);
                current_paren = "";
