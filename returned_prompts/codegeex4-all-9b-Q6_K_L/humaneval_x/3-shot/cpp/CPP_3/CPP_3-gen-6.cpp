First of all, the A: in front of your code makes it hard to read. I suggest to remove that.
The first function is correct, but it can be simplified:
bool has_close_elements(const std::vector<float>& numbers, float threshold){
    for (size_t i = 0; i < numbers.size(); ++i) {
        for (size_t j = i + 1; j < numbers.size(); ++j) {
            if (fabs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold) {
                return true;
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}

The second function looks correct, but the variable name i is a bit confusing. I suggest to rename it to index.
The third function can be simplified:
float truncate_number(float number){
    return fmod(number, 1);
}

The fourth function has a logical error. When the sum is negative, the function should return true, but when the sum is zero, the function should return false. I suggest to change the condition to if (sum <= 0). Also, the return statement can be simplified:
bool below_zero(const std::vector<int>& operations){
    int sum = std::accumulate(operations.begin(), operations.end(), 0);
    return sum <= 0;
}

Overall, the code is correct, but it can be simplified and improved.
