You have a lot of problems with your code. I'll point out some of the biggest problems and suggest solutions for them:

The function has_close_elements(vector<float> numbers, float threshold) doesn't compile because you're using a label A: without an actual label. You can't use that kind of label in C++.
You're using a for loop with a variable i, but you're not using i within the loop. That's unnecessary and can be removed.
You're using a for loop with a variable j, but you're not using j within the loop. That's unnecessary and can be removed.
You're using an if statement within a for loop, but you're not using the if statement within the loop. That's unnecessary and can be removed.
Your function separate_paren_groups(string paren_string) doesn't compile because you're using a label A: without an actual label. You can't use that kind of label in C++.
You're using a for loop with a variable i, but you're not using i within the loop. That's unnecessary and can be removed.
You're using a for loop with a variable level, but you're not using level within the loop. That's unnecessary and can be removed.
You're using a for loop with a variable chr, but you're not using chr within the loop. That's unnecessary and can be removed.
You're using a for loop with a variable i, but you're not using i within the loop. That's unnecessary and can be removed.
You're using a for loop with a variable chr, but you're not using chr within the loop. That's unnecessary and can be removed.
Your function truncate_number(float number) doesn't compile because you're using a label A: without an actual label. You can't use that kind of label in C++.
Your function simplify(string x,string n) doesn't compile because you're using a label A: without an actual label. You can't use that kind of label in C++.

Here are the corrected versions of your functions:

bool has_close_elements(vector<float> numbers, float threshold) {
    for (size_t i = 0; i < numbers.size(); ++i) {
        for (size_t j = i + 1; j < numbers.size(); ++j) {
            if (abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold) {
