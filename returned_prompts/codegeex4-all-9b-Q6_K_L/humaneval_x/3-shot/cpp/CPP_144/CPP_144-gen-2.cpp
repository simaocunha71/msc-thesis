The first problem is that you have not included the proper header for vector. You should include the <vector> header at the top of your file.
#include <vector>

The second problem is that you have not included the proper header for string. You should include the <string> header at the top of your file.
#include <string>

The third problem is that you have not included the proper header for math operations. You should include the <cmath> header at the top of your file.
#include <cmath>
