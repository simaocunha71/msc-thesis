There are multiple ways to solve these problems. Below are some general recommendations and some specific feedback on your solutions:

Use proper indenting
You have inconsistent indentation. It's important to use a consistent style to make your code easier to read. A lot of developers use an indentation of 4 or 2 spaces. I personally prefer 4 spaces, but you should choose one style and stick with it.
Use proper naming
Your function names are not descriptive. In order to be helpful to the reader, the names should describe what the function does. For example, has_close_elements is not descriptive enough. A better name would be are_any_two_numbers_close_to_each_other. This would make it clear to the reader what the function is supposed to do.
Use proper variable naming
Your variable names are not descriptive. This makes it hard for the reader to understand what the variable is supposed to represent. For example, the variable i is not descriptive enough. A better name would be index or loop_index. This would make it clear to the reader what the variable is supposed to represent.
Use proper formatting
Your formatting is not consistent. This makes it hard for the reader to understand your code. For example, you have inconsistent spacing around your operators. You should use consistent spacing around your operators. Also, you should use consistent spacing around your braces. You should use consistent spacing around your semicolons.
Use proper data structures
You are using a vector to store your numbers. This is not the best choice for this problem. A better choice would be an array or a list. This would make it easier to access the elements of the array or list.
Use proper data types
You are using a float to store
