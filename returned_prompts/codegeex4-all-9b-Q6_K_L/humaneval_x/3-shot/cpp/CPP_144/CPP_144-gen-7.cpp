This is a nice set of exercises, though it's a little hard to tell from the provided code what your exact requirements are. I'll try to give you some general advice, but feel free to ask for more specific feedback.

1. Avoid global variables
Global variables are the enemy of good programming. In this case, all your functions are free of them, which is good. However, you should be careful not to introduce any new ones.

2. Use a consistent naming convention
It's a good idea to use a consistent naming convention for your variables and functions. For example, you could use camelCase for variable names and PascalCase for function names.

3. Use descriptive variable names
Your variable names are mostly descriptive, but you could make them even better. For example, in your second function, you could use a more descriptive name for the string variable, like "parenthesesString" instead of "paren_string".

4. Use a consistent indentation style
You're using a consistent indentation style, which is good. However, you might want to consider using a tab size of 4 spaces instead of 4 tabs. This will make your code easier to read and edit.

5. Use a consistent line length
It's a good idea to use a consistent line length for your code. This will make it easier to read and edit. For example, you could limit your line length to 80 characters.

6. Use a consistent spacing style
It's a good idea to use a consistent spacing style for
