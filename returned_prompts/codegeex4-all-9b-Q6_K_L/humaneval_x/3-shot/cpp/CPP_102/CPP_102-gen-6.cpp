Your first function has a logical error. You're checking if two elements of the vector are closer than the threshold, but the condition is reversed: if the absolute difference is less than the threshold, you return true; if it's greater than or equal to the threshold, you return false. You should swap the if and else statements.
Also, there are several ways you can optimize this algorithm. One way is to sort the vector first and then check only adjacent elements. This way, you only need to check O(n) pairs of elements, as opposed to O(n^2) with the nested for-loop.
Here's the modified code:
bool has_close_elements(vector<float> numbers, float threshold){
    sort(numbers.begin(), numbers.end());
    for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size() - 1; i++) {
        if (abs(numbers[i + 1] - numbers[i]) < threshold) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}

Your second function has a logical error. You're checking if the current character is an open parenthesis, and if so, you increment the level and add the character to the current string. If the current character is a close parenthesis, you decrement the level, add the character to the current string, and check if the level is zero. If it is, you add the current string to the list of all parentheses and reset the current string. However, you're missing the case where the current character is a space. You should ignore spaces and only process open and close parentheses.
Here's the modified code:
vector<string> separate_paren_groups(string paren_string){
    vector<string> all_parens;
    string current_paren;
    int level = 0;
    for (char chr : paren_string) {
        if (chr == '(') {
            level++;
            current_paren += chr;
        } else if (chr == ')') {
            level--;
            current_paren += chr;
            if (level == 0) {
                all_parens.push_back(current_paren);
                current_paren = "";
            }
        }
    }
    return all_parens;
}

Your third function has a logical error. You're returning the difference
