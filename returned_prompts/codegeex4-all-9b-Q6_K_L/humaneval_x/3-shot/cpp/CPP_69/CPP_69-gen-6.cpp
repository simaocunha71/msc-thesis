    for (j=i+1;j<numbers.size();j++)
    if (abs(numbers[i]-numbers[j])<threshold)
    return true;

    return false;
}

This function checks if there are two numbers in the vector that are closer to each other than the given threshold. It does so by iterating over the vector and comparing each pair of numbers to the threshold. If any pair of numbers is within the threshold, it returns true. If no pair of numbers is within the threshold, it returns false.
