has_close_elements
There are a few issues with this code, in addition to being incomplete. The first is that the variable i is declared twice, which is a syntax error. The second is that the function is declared to return a boolean value, but it will not compile due to the missing return statement. Finally, the function does not do anything with the threshold parameter.
Here is a corrected version of the function:
bool has_close_elements(vector<float> numbers, float threshold){
    for (size_t i = 0; i < numbers.size(); ++i) {
        for (size_t j = i + 1; j < numbers.size(); ++j) {
            if (abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold) {
                return true;
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}

separate_paren_groups
There are a few issues with this code. The first is that the variable chr is declared twice, which is a syntax error. The second is that the variable level is not initialized to 0. Finally, the function does not do anything with the paren_string parameter.
Here is a corrected version of the function:
vector<string> separate_paren_groups(string paren_string){
    vector<string> all_parens;
    string current_paren;
    int level = 0;
    char chr;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < paren_string.length(); ++i) {
        chr = paren_string[i];
        if (chr == '(') {
            ++level;
            current_paren += chr;
        } else if (chr == ')') {
            --level;
            current_paren += chr;
            if (level == 0) {
                all_parens.push_back(current_paren);
                current_paren.clear();
            }
        }
    }
    return all_parens;
}

truncate_number
The function is incomplete, as it does not return anything. Here is a corrected version of the function:
float truncate_number(float number){
    return number
