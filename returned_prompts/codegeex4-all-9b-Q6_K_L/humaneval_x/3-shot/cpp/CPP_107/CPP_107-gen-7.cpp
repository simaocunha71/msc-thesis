has_close_elements:
Your function name is a bit misleading. The function name suggests it checks if there are two close elements. But it actually checks if there are two elements closer than the given threshold. I suggest renaming it to has_close_elements_within_threshold.

separate_paren_groups:
Your function name is a bit misleading. The function name suggests it separates groups of parentheses. But it actually separates groups of balanced parentheses. I suggest renaming it to separate_balanced_paren_groups.

truncate_number:
Your function name is a bit misleading. The function name suggests it truncates the number. But it actually returns the decimal part of the number. I suggest renaming it to get_decimal_part.

even_odd_palindrome:
Your function name is a bit misleading. The function name suggests it checks if there are even and odd palindromes. But it actually returns the number of even and odd palindromes. I suggest renaming it to count_even_odd_palindromes.
