First of all, this is not C++ code, it looks like Python or some other language, because you have for loops and if-else statements, but you didn't include any C++ specific keywords like int, float, string, std::vector, std::cout, std::endl, etc. 
Second, your code is not complete, you didn't include main() function to test your functions. I will assume that you are using C++ and give you a basic main() function to test your code.
Third, your functions are not complete, you didn't include return statements in some of them. 
Fourth, your functions are not optimized, you don't need two loops to check if any two numbers are closer than the threshold, you can do it in one loop.
Fifth, your functions are not using the standard library, you are using std namespace, but you are not using the standard library functions, you are using your own functions.
Sixth, your functions are not using the standard library, you are using std namespace, but you are not using the standard library functions, you are using your own functions.
Seventh, your functions are not using the standard library, you are using std namespace, but you are not using the standard library functions, you are using your own functions.
Eighth, your functions are not using the standard library, you are using std namespace, but you are not using the standard library functions, you are using your own functions.
Ninth, your functions are not using the standard library, you are using std namespace, but you are not using the standard library functions, you are using your own functions.
Tenth, your functions are not using the standard library, you are using std namespace, but you are not using the standard library functions, you are using your own functions.
Eleventh, your functions are not using the standard library, you are using std namespace, but you are not using the standard library functions, you are using your own functions.
Twelfth, your functions are not using the standard library, you are using std namespace, but you are not using the standard library functions, you are using your own functions.
