The first problem is that the first code does not compile. The issue is with the fact that you are using the variable i in the for loop, but also a named function i that you are declaring at the start of the function. To fix this, simply remove the i before the for loop declaration.
Second, the first code does not actually check if the numbers are within the threshold. It only checks if the numbers are not farther apart than the threshold, but that does not actually mean they are close to each other. You need to use the variable j to check if the numbers are within the threshold.
Third, the second code does not actually separate the groups of parentheses. It only creates a new string with all the parentheses. To fix this, you need to check if the level is 0 after the for loop, and if it is, you need to add the current_paren to the all_parens vector.
Fourth, the third code does not actually truncate the number. It simply returns the number minus the integer part of the number. To fix this, you need to use the fmod function to get the decimal part of the number.
Fifth, the fourth code does not actually intersperse the delimeter between the numbers. It simply adds the delimeter to the end of each number in the vector. To fix this, you need to add the delimeter between each number, not at the end of the vector.
Here is the corrected code:
#include<stdio.h>
#include<vector>
#include<math.h>
#include<string>
using namespace std;
bool has_close_elements(vector<float> numbers, float threshold){
    for (int i=0;i<numbers.size();i++)
        for (int j=i+1;j<numbers.size();j++)
            if (abs(numbers[i]-numbers[j])<threshold)
                return true;
    return false;
}

vector<string> separate_paren_groups(string paren_string){
    vector<string> all_parens;
    string current_paren;
    int level=0;
    char chr;
    int i;
    for (i=0;i<paren_string.length();i++)
    {
        chr=paren_string[i];
        if (chr=='(')
        {
            level+=1;
            current_paren
