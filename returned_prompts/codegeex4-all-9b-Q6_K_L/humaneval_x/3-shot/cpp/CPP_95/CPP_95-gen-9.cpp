Your code has a few issues that need to be fixed:
has_close_elements:
This function will not compile because you are using the C++ standard library, but you are using C++ style casts. Replace:
if (abs(numbers[i]-numbers[j])<threshold)

with
if (abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold)

separate_paren_groups:
This function does not handle the case where there are multiple groups of parentheses nested within each other. For example, the input string "((()))" will be treated as a single group, but the desired output is {"()", "(())"}. To fix this, you need to add a check to see if the current character is a closing parenthesis, and if so, add the current group to the list of groups, and reset the current group. Here is the updated function:
vector<string> separate_paren_groups(string paren_string){
    vector<string> all_parens;
    string current_paren;
    int level=0;
    char chr;
    int i;
    for (i=0;i<paren_string.length();i++)
    {
        chr=paren_string[i];
        if (chr=='(')
        {
            level+=1;
            current_paren+=chr;
        }
        if (chr==')')
        {
            level-=1;
            current_paren+=chr;
            if (level==0){
                all_parens.push_back(current_paren);
                current_paren="";
            }
        }
    }
    return all_parens;
}

truncate_number:
This function will not compile because you are using the C++ standard library, but you are using C style casts. Replace:
return number-int(number);

with
return number - static_cast<int>(number);

check_dict_case:
