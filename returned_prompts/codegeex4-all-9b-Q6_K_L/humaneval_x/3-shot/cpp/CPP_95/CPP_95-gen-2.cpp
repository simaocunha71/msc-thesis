There are a few issues with your code that we need to address. Let's go through each function one by one:

### has_close_elements
The logic in your function is mostly correct, but there is a mistake in the condition for checking if two numbers are close. You need to compare the absolute difference between the numbers to the threshold, not the absolute difference between the indices of the numbers in the vector. Here's the corrected code:
```cpp
bool has_close_elements(vector<float> numbers, float threshold) {
    for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < numbers.size(); j++) {
            if (abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold) {
                return true;
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

### separate_paren_groups
In your function, you are using a for loop to iterate through the characters of the input string. However, you are not correctly handling the case where the input string contains spaces. You need to skip over any spaces you encounter. Here's the corrected code:
```cpp
vector<string> separate_paren_groups(string paren_string) {
    vector<string> all_parens;
    string current_paren;
    int level = 0;
    char chr;
    for (int i = 0; i < paren_string.length(); i++) {
        chr = paren_string[i];
        if (chr == '(') {
            level += 1;
            current_paren += chr;
        } else if (chr == ')') {
            level -= 1;
            current_paren += chr;
            if (level == 0) {
                all_parens.push_back(current_paren);
                current_paren = "";
            }
        }
    }
    return all_parens;
}
```

### truncate_number
Your function is correct, but there is a small improvement that can be made. Instead of using the `int` function to truncate the number, you can use the `floor` function from the `<cmath>` library. Here's the corrected code:
```cpp
#include <cmath>

float truncate_number(float number) {
    return number - floor(number);
}
```
