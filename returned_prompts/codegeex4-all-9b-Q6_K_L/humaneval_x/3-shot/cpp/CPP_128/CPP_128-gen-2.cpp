A: Your function looks fine, but I would suggest using a more descriptive variable name, e.g. sum instead of prod_signs as the function calculates the sum.
Also, the name prod_signs suggests that it calculates a product, but the actual logic is summing up the absolute value of the numbers, multiplied by their sign. If you want to keep the name, you should change the function's logic to calculate the product of the absolute values of the numbers, multiplied by their sign.
