The first function looks good. There is just one thing that I would suggest. You can make the code more efficient by not using the absolute function. Instead, you can check if the difference is less than or equal to the threshold and return true. If none of the pairs satisfy this condition, return false.
Here is the modified code:
bool has_close_elements(vector<float> numbers, float threshold){
    int i,j;
    
    for (i=0;i<numbers.size();i++)
        for (j=i+1;j<numbers.size();j++)
            if (numbers[i]-numbers[j] < threshold)
                return true;

    return false;
}

The second function is good too. However, you can make the code more efficient by not using the substr function. Instead, you can use the string's built-in functions to extract the numbers. Here is the modified code:
vector<string> separate_paren_groups(string paren_string){
    vector<string> all_parens;
    string current_paren;
    int level=0;
    char chr;
    int i;
    for (i=0;i<paren_string.length();i++){
        chr=paren_string[i];
        if (chr=='('){
            level+=1;
            current_paren+=chr;
        }
        if (chr==')'){
            level-=1;
            current_paren+=chr;
            if (level==0){
                all_parens.push_back(current_paren);
                current_paren="";
            }
        }
    }
    return all_parens;
}

The third function is also good. However, you can make the code more efficient by not using the atoi function. Instead, you can use the string's built-in functions to extract the numbers. Here is the modified code:
float truncate_number(float number){
    return number - int
