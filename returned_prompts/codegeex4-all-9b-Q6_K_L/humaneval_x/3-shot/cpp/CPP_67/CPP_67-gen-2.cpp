The first question is asking you to write a function that checks if there are two numbers in the vector that are closer to each other than the threshold. You can do this by iterating through the vector and comparing each pair of numbers. If the difference between the two numbers is less than the threshold, then return true. If you get through the whole vector without finding any pairs that are closer than the threshold, then return false.
The second question is asking you to write a function that separates groups of parentheses in a string into separate strings. You can do this by iterating through the string and keeping track of the level of parentheses. When you encounter an open parenthesis, increment the level. When you encounter a close parenthesis, decrement the level. If the level is 0 (i.e., you've just closed a group of parentheses), then add the current group to the vector of groups and start a new group.
The third question is asking you to write a function that returns the decimal part of a number. You can do this by subtracting the integer part of the number from the number itself.
The fourth question is asking you to write a function that calculates the number of mango fruits in a basket given a string that represents the number of apples and oranges and an integer that represents the total number of fruits in the basket. You can do this by parsing the string to find the number of apples and oranges and then subtracting those numbers from the total number of fruits to get the number of mangoes.
