1. Naming
The functions have the prefix "has_" and "separate_". I would suggest to use "has_close_elements" and "separate_parentheses_groups", as it makes clear what the function does.
2. For has_close_elements
The for loops are nested, which makes it hard to read. I would suggest to use a while loop with an index.
3. For separate_paren_groups
I would suggest to use a while loop with an index, and to check if the current character is a space or not. If it is a space, you would continue to the next character.
4. For truncate_number
You could use the fmod function to calculate the decimal part of the number.
5. For fruit_distribution
I would suggest to use the find function to find the indices of the 'a' and 'o' characters. Then you could use the substr function to extract the numbers. Finally, you could use the atoi function to convert the string to an integer.
6. For all functions
I would suggest to add comments to explain what the function does, and to add error checking to make sure that the input is valid.
