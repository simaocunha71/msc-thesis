1. has_close_elements:

    Your for loops are not correctly nesting, they should be:
    for (i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++)
        for (j = i + 1; j < numbers.size(); j++)

    It is more idiomatic to use range-based for loops with vectors.

2. separate_paren_groups:

    You are not checking for empty strings, you should be returning an empty vector in that case.

3. truncate_number:

    You are not handling negative numbers, you should be returning 0 in that case.

4. fizz_buzz:

    Your loop is not correctly counting the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13. You should be using the modulo operator (%) to check if the number is divisible by 11 or 13, and the floor function (floor) to get the largest integer smaller than n. Your code should be:
    for (i = 1; i < floor(n); i++)
        if (i % 11 == 0 || i % 13 == 0)
