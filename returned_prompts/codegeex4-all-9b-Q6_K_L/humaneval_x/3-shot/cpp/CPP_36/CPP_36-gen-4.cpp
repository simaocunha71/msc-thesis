1. has_close_elements
Your algorithm is inefficient.  It has a time complexity of O(n^2) because for each element, you iterate over all other elements.  Instead, you can sort the elements and iterate over them once, checking the difference between each pair of adjacent elements.  This will give you a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting.
2. separate_paren_groups
Your algorithm is correct, but it could be improved by using a stack.  This would make the code more intuitive and easier to understand.
3. truncate_number
Your algorithm is correct, but it could be improved by using the fmod function instead of the int function.  This would give you more precision.
4. fizz_buzz
Your algorithm is correct, but it could be improved by using a modulo operator instead of a division operator.  This would make the code more efficient.
