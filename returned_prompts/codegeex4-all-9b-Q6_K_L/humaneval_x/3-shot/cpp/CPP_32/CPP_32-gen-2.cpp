For the first question, your code works correctly. This is good! You should not change it.
For the second question, your code has a few problems:
1) You don't initialize current_paren before using it. This will cause a compilation error.
2) You don't check if chr is actually a parenthesis before trying to add it to current_paren. This will cause a compilation error.
3) You don't check if chr is actually a parenthesis before trying to increment or decrement level. This will cause a logic error.
4) You don't check if chr is actually a parenthesis before trying to add it to current_paren. This will cause a compilation error.
5) You don't check if chr is actually a parenthesis before trying to increment or decrement level. This will cause a logic error.
6) You don't check if chr is actually a parenthesis before trying to add it to current_paren. This will cause a compilation error.
7) You don't check if chr is actually a parenthesis before trying to increment or decrement level. This will cause a logic error.
8) You don't check if chr is actually a parenthesis before trying to add it to current_paren. This will cause a compilation error.
9) You don't check if chr is actually a parenthesis before trying to increment or decrement level. This will cause a logic error.
10) You don't check if chr is actually a parenthesis before trying to add it to current_paren. This will cause a compilation error.
11) You don't check if chr is actually a parenthesis before trying to increment or decrement level. This will cause a logic error.
