has_close_elements
This function is a bit confusing because it takes a vector of floats and a float threshold, but it doesn't really make sense to compare floats with an absolute difference threshold. Floats are not exact, so you can't really say that two floats are "close" to each other if their difference is less than a certain threshold. It would be better to use a different data type for the numbers, like integers, or to use a different approach for comparing the numbers.
Also, the function name "has_close_elements" is a bit unclear. It would be better to name it something like "has_close_numbers" or "has_close_elements_within_threshold".

separate_paren_groups
This function is a bit confusing because it takes a string and returns a vector of strings. It would be better to name it something like "separate_parentheses_groups" or "separate_balanced_parentheses_groups" to make it clearer.

truncate_number
This function is a bit confusing because it takes a float and returns a float. It would be better to name it something like "get_decimal_part" or "truncate_decimal_part" to make it clearer.

string_xor
This function is a bit confusing because it takes two strings and returns a string. It would be better to name it something like
