1. Avoid using namespace std
It is considered bad practice to use using namespace std;. This is because it can cause name clashes with other libraries. It is better to use the std:: prefix for standard library names.

2. Avoid using single letter variable names
Using single letter variable names is considered bad practice as it can make the code harder to read and understand. Try to use descriptive names that explain what the variable is used for.

3. Avoid magic numbers
In the has_close_elements function, the comparison abs(numbers[i]-numbers[j])<threshold is using a magic number. Instead, it should use the threshold variable directly.

4. Avoid global variables
In the separate_paren_groups function, the variable level is used as a global variable. Instead, it should be passed as a parameter to the function.

5. Avoid using goto statements
In the separate_paren_groups function, the goto statement is used to jump to the label A:. Instead, it should be replaced with a return statement.

6. Avoid using return in a loop
In the has_close_elements function, the return statement is used inside the loop. Instead, it should be moved outside the loop.

7. Avoid using return in a function with a void return type
In the separate_paren_groups function, the return statement is used in a function with a void return type. Instead, it should be replaced with a return statement that returns a vector<string>.

8. Avoid using return in a function with a non-void return type
In the truncate_number function, the return statement is used in a function with a non-void return type. Instead, it should be replaced with a return statement that returns a float.

9. Avoid using return in a function with a non-void return type
In the reverse_delete function, the return statement is used in a function with a non-void return type. Instead, it should be replaced with a return statement that returns a vector<string>.
