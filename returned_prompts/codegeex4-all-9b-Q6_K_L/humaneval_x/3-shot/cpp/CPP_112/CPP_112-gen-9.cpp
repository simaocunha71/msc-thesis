The separate_paren_groups function could be improved by removing the level variable.  Instead, you could use a boolean flag to indicate whether you are inside a group or not.  This would simplify the logic and reduce the number of variables used.
The truncate_number function is correct, but you could use the fmod function instead of subtracting the integer part from the number.  This would be more accurate for very large numbers.
The reverse_delete function is correct, but you could use the erase-remove idiom to remove the characters from the result string.  This would be more efficient and more readable.
Overall, the code is mostly correct, but there are some improvements that could be made.
