Review of has_close_elements
The code for this function is pretty good.  The only thing that could be improved is the use of the abs function.  The standard library has a function called fabs that can be used to get the absolute value of a float.
The code is also a little bit inefficient because it uses nested loops.  This is not a problem for small vectors, but it could cause performance issues for large vectors.  One way to improve the performance of this function is to sort the vector first.  This would allow you to use a single loop to check for close elements.
Review of separate_paren_groups
The code for this function is also pretty good.  The only thing that could be improved is the use of the string concatenation operator.  This is not a big problem, but it is not very efficient.  A better solution would be to use a stringstream.
Another thing that could be improved is the use of the char data type.  This is not a big problem, but it is not very efficient.  A better solution would be to use the int data type.
Review of truncate_number
The code for this function is pretty good.  The only thing that could be improved is the use of the int function.  This is not a big problem, but it is not very efficient.  A better solution would be to use the floor function.
Review of intersection
The code for this function is pretty good.  The only thing that could be improved is the use of the if statement.  This is not a big problem, but it is not very efficient.  A better solution would be to use a switch statement.
