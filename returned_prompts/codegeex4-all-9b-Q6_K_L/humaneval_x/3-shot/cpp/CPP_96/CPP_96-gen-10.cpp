This question has no answer since you provided no code to review. However, I will provide a review for each of the questions you provided (even though you didn't ask for a review).

has_close_elements

The function name is not very descriptive. The name should indicate what it does. For example, something like has_close_elements_within_threshold would be much better.
The function uses the old C for loop syntax. It would be better to use the new C++ for loop syntax.
You don't need to use the abs function to calculate the absolute value of two numbers. You can simply subtract the numbers directly.
You can simplify the condition inside the if statement by using the not operator (!). Instead of if (abs(numbers[i]-numbers[j])<threshold), you can use if (numbers[i]-numbers[j] < threshold && numbers[j]-numbers[i] < threshold).

separate_paren_groups

The function name is not very descriptive. The name should indicate what it does. For example, something like separate_balanced_paren_groups would be much better.
The function uses the old C for loop syntax. It would be better to use the new C++ for loop syntax.
You don't need to use the == operator to compare two characters. You can simply use the == operator directly.
You don't need to use the += operator to concatenate a character to a string. You can simply use the + operator directly.
You don't need to use the length function to get the length of a string. You can simply use the length() function directly.
You don't need to use the push_back function to add an element to a vector. You can simply use the push_back() function directly.

truncate_number

The function name is not very descriptive. The name should indicate what it does. For example, something like get_decimal_part would be much better.
The function uses the old C for loop syntax. It would be better to use the new C++ for loop syntax.
You don't need to use the int function to convert a float to an int. You can simply use the int() function directly.
You don't need to use the - operator to subtract two
