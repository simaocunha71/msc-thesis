Style and readability
First of all, your code is not very readable, at least not the way it is presented here. You should format it properly, for example, with a 4 space indentation and a line length of 80 characters. This helps you and your readers to understand the code.
Also, the A: lines are not necessary and should be removed.
Secondly, your code has a lot of unnecessary comments. Comments should explain why the code does something and not what it does. For example, your function has_close_elements has a comment about the return value of the function. This is redundant because the return statement clearly states what the function returns.
Thirdly, your code is not very modular. You should try to break it down into smaller functions that do one thing and do it well. For example, your function separate_paren_groups has two nested loops. This makes it hard to understand what the function is doing. You should try to break it down into smaller functions that do one thing and do it well.
Fourthly, your code is not very efficient. For example, your function count_up_to has two nested loops. This makes it slow for large inputs. You should try to optimize your code to make it run faster.
Fifthly, your code is not very clean. For example, your function separate_paren_groups has a variable named current_paren. This is not a very descriptive name. You should try to choose names that are descriptive and make your code easier to understand.
Sixthly, your code is not very robust. For example, your function count_up_to does not handle the case where n is less than 0. You should try to make your code more robust by handling all possible inputs.
Seventhly, your code is not very well documented. For example, your function separate_paren_groups does not have a documentation string that explains what the function does. You should try to add documentation strings to your functions to make them more understandable.
Conclusion
Your code is not very readable, efficient, clean, robust, or well
