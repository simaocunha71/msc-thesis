The first problem with your has_close_elements function is that you are not using a float type for your threshold. Your function takes a float as an argument, but you are using an integer to store the threshold. This will lead to incorrect results if the threshold is not a whole number.
The second problem is that you are using an integer type for your loop variables. While this is not incorrect, it is not the best practice. It is better to use a floating point type for loop variables when you are working with floating point numbers.
The third problem with your has_close_elements function is that you are not checking if the difference between the two numbers is less than the threshold. You are checking if the absolute value of the difference between the two numbers is less than the threshold. This will cause your function to return true for numbers that are not actually close to each other.
The fourth problem with your has_close_elements function is that you are not returning false if no two numbers are close to each other. You are only returning true if two numbers are close to each other.
The fifth problem with your has_close_elements function is that you are not using a break statement in your inner loop. If two numbers are close to each other, you should return true immediately and stop checking the rest of the numbers.
Here is the corrected version of your has_close_elements function:
bool has_close_elements(vector<float> numbers, float threshold){
    for (int i=0; i<numbers.size(); i++){
        for (int j=i+1; j<numbers.size(); j++){
            if (abs(numbers[i]-numbers[j]) < threshold){
                return true;
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}

The second problem with your separate_paren_groups function is that you are not checking if the current character is a space before adding it to the current_paren string. This will cause your function to include spaces in the parentheses groups.
The third problem with your separate_paren_groups function is that you are not checking if the level is 0 before adding the current_paren string to the all_parens vector. This will cause your function to add empty strings to the all_parens vector.
Here is the corrected version of your separate_paren_groups function:
vector<string> separate_paren_groups(string paren_string){
