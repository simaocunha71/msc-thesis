The C++ standard library is the standard way to do things in C++. It is a set of classes and functions that provide the common functionality that is required in most C++ programs. Using the C++ standard library is not only more efficient, but it is also more readable and easier to maintain.
For example, instead of using the C standard library functions like printf and scanf, you should use the C++ standard library functions like std::cout and std::cin. These functions are more flexible and easier to use than the C standard library functions.
Here are some of the advantages of using the C++ standard library:

It is more efficient. The C++ standard library is designed to be as efficient as possible. It uses templates and other techniques to make the library as fast as possible.
It is more readable. The C++ standard library is designed to be as readable as possible. It uses classes and functions that have clear and concise names. This makes the code easier to read and understand.
It is easier to maintain. The C++ standard library is designed to be as easy to maintain as possible. It uses classes and functions that are well-documented and easy to understand. This makes the code easier to maintain and debug.

Here are some examples of how to use the C++ standard library:

To print a string to the console, you can use the std::cout object. For example:

std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;

To read a string from the console, you can use the std::cin object. For example:

std::string input;
std::cin >> input;

To sort a vector of integers, you can use the std::sort function. For example:

std::vector<int> numbers = {3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5};
std::sort(numbers.begin(), numbers.end());

To create a new object of a class, you can use the new keyword. For example:

MyClass* myObject = new MyClass();

To delete an object of a class, you can use the delete keyword. For
