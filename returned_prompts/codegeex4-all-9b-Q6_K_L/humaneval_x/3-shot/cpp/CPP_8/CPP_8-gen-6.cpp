Your first function has_close_elements() is a simple nested loop that iterates through all elements of the vector and checks if the absolute difference between any two numbers is smaller than threshold. If yes, it returns true, otherwise, after all iterations, it returns false.
The function separate_paren_groups() is more complicated. It first initializes a vector of strings all_parens and a string current_paren. Then it initializes a counter level to 0. It loops over every character in the input string paren_string. When it encounters an opening parenthesis, it increments level by 1 and appends the parenthesis to current_paren. When it encounters a closing parenthesis, it decrements level by 1 and appends the parenthesis to current_paren. If level becomes 0, it means a group of parentheses is completed and current_paren is appended to all_parens, and current_paren is reset to an empty string. Finally, it returns all_parens.
The function truncate_number() is straightforward. It subtracts the integer part of the input number from the number itself and returns the result.
The function sum_product() iterates through the input vector numbers and adds all elements to sum and multiplies all elements to product. It returns a vector containing sum and product.
