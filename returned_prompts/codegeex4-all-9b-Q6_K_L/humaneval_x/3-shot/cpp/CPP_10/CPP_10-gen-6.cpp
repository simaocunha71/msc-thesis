These problems are written in C++, and you seem to be using C. Here are the C++ solutions for your problems:
1. has_close_elements() problem:
You have to include std::abs() in your code. It is a function in the C++ standard library that returns the absolute value of a number. Here is the corrected code:
#include <algorithm>

// ... your code

if (std::abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold)
    return true;

// ... your code

2. separate_paren_groups() problem:
You have to include <string> in your code. Also, you have to include <algorithm> to use the std::reverse() function. Here is the corrected code:
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

// ... your code

std::reverse(current_paren.begin(), current_paren.end());

// ... your code

3. truncate_number() problem:
You have to include <cmath> in your code. Here is the corrected code:
#include <cmath>

// ... your code

return number - static_cast<int>(number);

// ... your code

4. make_palindrome() problem:
You have to include <algorithm> to use the std::reverse() function. Also, you have to include <string> to use the std::string class. Here is the corrected code:
#include <algorithm>
#include <string>

// ... your code

std::reverse(current_paren.begin(), current_paren.end());

// ... your code

Also, there is a bug in your make_palindrome() function. You should return the final string after the loop, not inside it. Here is the corrected code:
// ... your code

return final;

// ... your code

I hope these solutions help you!
