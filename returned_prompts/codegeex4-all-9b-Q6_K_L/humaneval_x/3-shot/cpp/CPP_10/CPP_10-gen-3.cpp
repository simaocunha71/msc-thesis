Your has_close_elements function is correct. I would suggest using a more descriptive name for your variables, for example i and j could be renamed to left and right.
Your separate_paren_groups function is correct.
Your truncate_number function is correct.
Your is_palindrome function is correct.
Your make_palindrome function is correct.

Overall, your code is well written and easy to understand.
