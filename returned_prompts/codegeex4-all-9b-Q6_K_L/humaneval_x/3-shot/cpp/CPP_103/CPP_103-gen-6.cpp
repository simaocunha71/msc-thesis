There are a few things to note here, though, that I didn't want to just go ahead and correct.
1.  Your comments are not very helpful.  They explain what the code is supposed to do, but not how it is supposed to do it.  This is something that you should be doing in your head.  As a developer, you should be explaining to yourself what the code is supposed to do.  You don't need to explain to others what the code is supposed to do.  You do need to explain to others what the code does, though, but that is different than what it is supposed to do.
2.  The first function has a name that is not very descriptive.  It's name is "has_close_elements", but it does not tell you what it is supposed to do.  It should be called "are_numbers_close_together", which tells you what the function is supposed to do.  Another option would be "has_two_numbers_close_together".
3.  The first function is missing a semicolon at the end of the line with the return statement.
4.  The second function is missing a semicolon at the end of the line with the return statement.
5.  The second function is not very descriptive.  It's name is "separate_paren_groups", which tells you what the function is supposed to do, but not how it is supposed to do it.  It should be called "separate_balanced_paren_groups".
6.  The second function is not very descriptive.  The return statement is returning a vector of strings.  This should be described in the return statement.
7.  The second function is not very descriptive.  The variable "all_parens" is not very descriptive.  It should be called "paren_groups".
8.  The second function is not very descriptive.  The variable "current_paren" is not very descriptive.  It should be called "current_group".
9.  The second function is not very descriptive.  The variable "level" is not very descriptive.  It should be called "nesting_level".
10. The second
