The first thing that jumps out at me is the use of a goto statement. This is a bad practice and should be avoided.
Instead of using a goto statement, you can use a label and break statement to get out of the loop. This would make the code easier to read and understand.
Here is an example of how you can modify the code:
for (i=0;i<numbers.size();i++)
    for (j=i+1;j<numbers.size();j++)
    {
        if (abs(numbers[i]-numbers[j])<threshold)
        {
            return true;
        }
    }

return false;

The second thing that jumps out at me is the use of a global namespace. This is a bad practice and should be avoided.
Instead of using a global namespace, you can use a namespace for each function. This would make the code easier to read and understand.
Here is an example of how you can modify the code:
namespace has_close_elements
{
    bool has_close_elements(vector<float> numbers, float threshold)
    {
        for (int i=0;i<numbers.size();i++)
        {
            for (int j=i+1;j<numbers.size();j++)
            {
                if (abs(numbers[i]-numbers[j])<threshold)
                {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }

        return false;
    }
}
