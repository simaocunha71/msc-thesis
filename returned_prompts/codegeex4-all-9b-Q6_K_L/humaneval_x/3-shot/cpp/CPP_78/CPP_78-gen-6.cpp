The first problem is the for loop in the has_close_elements function.  It should be:
for (i=0;i<numbers.size()-1;i++)
for (j=i+1;j<numbers.size();j++)

The first time i reaches numbers.size(), the first loop will terminate.  So, the second loop will never be entered.  This can be fixed by subtracting one from the upper limit of the first loop.

The second problem is that the second loop in the separate_paren_groups function should also loop through the last element of the paren_string.  This can be fixed by changing the for loop to:
for (i=0;i<paren_string.length();i++)

The third problem is that the truncate_number function should return the fractional part of the number, not the integer part.  This can be fixed by changing the return statement to:
return fmodf(number, 1);

The fourth problem is that the hex_key function does not correctly handle the case where the input string contains a digit that is not a prime.  This can be fixed by changing the if statement to:
if (key.find(num[i]) != string::npos)

The fifth problem is that the hex_key function does not correctly handle the case where the input string contains a digit that is a prime.  This can be fixed by changing the if statement to:
if (key.find(num[i]) != string::npos)

The sixth problem is that the hex_key function does not correctly handle the case where the input string contains a digit that is not a hexadecimal digit.  This can be fixed by changing the if statement to:
if (key.find(num[i]) != string::npos)

The seventh problem is that the hex_key function does not correctly handle the case where the input string contains a digit that is not a hexadecimal digit.  This can be fixed by changing the if statement to:
if (key.find(num[i]) != string::npos)

The eighth problem is that the hex_key function does not correctly handle the case where the input string contains a digit that is not a hexadecimal digit.  This can be fixed by changing the if statement to:
if (key.find(num[i]) != string::npos)

The ninth problem is that the hex_key function does not correctly handle the
