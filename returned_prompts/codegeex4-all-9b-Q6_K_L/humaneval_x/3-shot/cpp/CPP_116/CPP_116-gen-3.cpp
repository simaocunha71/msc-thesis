1. Function Naming
Your function names are all lowercase, which is good. But they're also quite short. I'd recommend making them a bit more descriptive, so that someone reading your code can understand what the function does at a glance. For example, "has_close_elements" could be renamed to "contains_close_elements", and "separate_paren_groups" could be renamed to "extract_balanced_parentheses".

2. Indentation
Your indentation is inconsistent. You have some functions with 2-space indentation, and others with 4-space indentation. It's best to stick with one style, so that your code is consistent and easy to read. I'd recommend using 4-space indentation.

3. Variable Naming
Your variable names are mostly descriptive, but some of them could be improved. For example, "numbers" could be renamed to "numbers_list", and "paren_string" could be renamed to "parentheses_string".

4. Comments
Your comments are a bit too verbose. For example, the comment for "has_close_elements" says "Check if in given vector of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.", which is already pretty clear. A more concise comment could simply say "Returns true if any two numbers in the list are closer than the given threshold."

5. Error Checking
Your functions don't seem to do any error checking. For example, in the "separate_paren_groups" function, what happens if the input string doesn't contain any parentheses? It would be better to add some error checking to make sure that the input string is valid.

6. Code Style
Your code style is generally good, but there are
