I don't really have time to fix all your code, but I'll do my best to point out the worst issues I see.
First, when you're using the namespace std, you don't need to prefix your std::vector and std::string with std::, so you could remove that.
Now, on to the first function. It doesn't seem to be using the given string parameter. It seems to be using a vector of floats instead. Did you mean to use a vector of floats instead of a string? If not, you should remove the string parameter and use a vector of floats.
In your second function, your function name is not very descriptive. It should be something like separate_parentheses_into_groups or separate_parentheses or something similar.
In your third function, you're using math.h for the abs() function, but you're including cmath instead. You should remove math.h and only include cmath.
In your fourth function, you're using the if statement to check if the character is a lowercase or uppercase letter, but you're using the same if statement for both. You should separate these into two different if statements.
Also, you're using the int keyword in your for loop, but you're not using the i variable in your loop. You should remove the int keyword and use the i variable in your loop.
Lastly, you're using the return false; statement in your last function, but you're not using the return true; statement in your if statement. You should use the return true; statement in your if statement.
