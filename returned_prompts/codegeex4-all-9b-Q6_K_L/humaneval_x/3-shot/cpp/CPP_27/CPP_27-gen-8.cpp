The first function you posted can be simplified considerably, by removing the need to compare all elements in the vector. For instance, you can simply loop through the vector, and keep track of the minimum and maximum element you have encountered so far. If at any point, the difference between the current element and the minimum element is less than the threshold, you can immediately return true. Otherwise, you can update the minimum and maximum, and continue. If you reach the end of the loop without returning true, you can return false. This algorithm is much more efficient than the current one, as it only requires a single pass through the vector.
Here is the revised code:
```cpp
bool has_close_elements(vector<float> numbers, float threshold) {
    if (numbers.empty()) {
        return false;
    }

    float min_val = numbers[0];
    float max_val = numbers[0];
    for (float num : numbers) {
        min_val = min(min_val, num);
        max_val = max(max_val, num);
        if (max_val - min_val < threshold) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```
The second function you posted seems to be correct, as it correctly separates the groups of parentheses into separate strings. However, you can simplify the code by using the string::find function to locate the next opening parenthesis, and the string::substr function to extract the substring between the current and next opening parenthesis. Here is the revised code:
```cpp
vector<string> separate_paren_groups(string paren_string) {
    vector<string> all_parens;
    string current_paren;
    int level = 0;
    size_t start = 0;
    size_t pos = 0;
    while ((pos = paren_string.find('(', start)) != string::npos) {
        level++;
        current_paren += paren_string.substr(start, pos - start);
        if (level == 1) {
            start = pos + 1;
        } else if (level == 0) {
            all
