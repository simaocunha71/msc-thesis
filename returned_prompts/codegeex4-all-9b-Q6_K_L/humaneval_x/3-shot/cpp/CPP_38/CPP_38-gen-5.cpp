Your code is mostly good, but there are some issues that could be improved.

has_close_elements
The function has_close_elements has a potential bug. If the input vector is empty, then the loop will not execute, and the function will return false.
Also, the function name is not very descriptive. It would be better to use a name that describes what the function is actually doing, such as "has_close_elements_within_threshold".

separate_paren_groups
The function separate_paren_groups has a potential bug. If there are two consecutive open parentheses without a closing parenthesis in between, then the function will not correctly separate the groups.
Also, the function name is not very descriptive. It would be better to use a name that describes what the function is actually doing, such as "get_parenthesis_groups".

truncate_number
The function truncate_number has a potential bug. If the input number is negative, then the function will return a positive value.
Also, the function name is not very descriptive. It would be better to use a name that describes what the function is actually doing, such as "get_decimal_part".

encode_cyclic and decode_cyclic
The functions encode_cyclic and decode_cyclic have a potential bug. If the input string has a length that is not a multiple of 3, then the function will not correctly encode or decode the string.
Also, the function names are not very descriptive. It would be better to use a name that describes what the function is actually doing, such as "cycle_characters_in_groups_of_three".

Overall, the code is mostly good, but there are some potential bugs and areas that could be improved.
