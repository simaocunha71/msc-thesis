The first question has no answer because you have not given any parameters for the function. I will assume you want to check if the vector has any two elements that are within 1 of each other. 

Your second question has a typo: paren_string.length(); should be paren_string.size();

Your third question's function name should start with a capital letter. 

Your fourth and fifth questions are fine. 

There is no need to use a goto in the second question's function. 

Your fifth question has a small bug. If the input string is of length 1 or 2, the return value is empty string. I believe you should return the original string in that case.
