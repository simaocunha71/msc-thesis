has_close_elements

This function has a common bug: the loop has a variable i and j, so when the first loop ends, the variable i is still in scope for the next loop, and it will continue to increment, so the output is wrong.
You can use a goto statement to jump out of the loop.
Also, this function is not very efficient. You can use a set to store the numbers, and then iterate through the set to find the closest pair of numbers.

separate_paren_groups

This function has a common bug: the loop has a variable i, so when the first loop ends, the variable i is still in scope for the next loop, and it will continue to increment, so the output is wrong.
You can use a goto statement to jump out of the loop.
Also, this function can be simplified. You can use a stack to store the parentheses, and then iterate through the string to find the groups.

truncate_number

This function is correct, but it can be simplified. You can use the fmod function to get the decimal part of the number.

sort_array

This function is correct, but it can be simplified. You can use the sort function to sort the array, and then use the reverse function to reverse the array if the sum is even.

Overall, these functions are not very efficient, and you can use more efficient algorithms to solve these problems.
