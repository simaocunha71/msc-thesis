1. Comment your code

Your code is well-commented, but it's a good practice to comment your code more extensively. For example, your has_close_elements function contains a comment block, but the comments are not really necessary. The code is self-explanatory. You could add comments to explain why you're doing something, but not what you're doing.

2. Use descriptive variable names

In your has_close_elements function, you're using i and j as loop variables. This is not a good practice. You should use more descriptive variable names, like left and right or index1 and index2.

3. Use the standard library's abs function

In your has_close_elements function, you're using the abs function from the math library. This is not necessary. The standard library's abs function is already defined in the math library, so you can just use it as is.

4. Use the standard library's sort function

In your sort_array function, you're using the sort function from the algorithm library. This is not necessary. The standard library's sort function is already defined in the algorithm library, so you can just use it as is.

5. Use the standard library's string class

In your separate_paren_groups function, you're using the string class from the string library. This is not necessary. The standard library's string class is already defined in the string library, so you can just use it as is.

6. Use the standard library's vector class

In your separate_paren_groups function, you're using the vector class from the vector library. This is not necessary. The standard library's vector class is already defined in the vector library, so you can just use it as is.
