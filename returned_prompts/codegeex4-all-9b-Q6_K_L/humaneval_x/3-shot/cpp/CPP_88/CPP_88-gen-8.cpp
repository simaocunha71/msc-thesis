has_close_elements
This function is correct and well-structured. It uses two nested loops to compare each pair of numbers in the vector and returns true if any pair is closer than the threshold. The use of abs() is appropriate for finding the absolute difference between two floating-point numbers.

separate_paren_groups
This function is also correct and well-structured. It iterates through the input string, building a string for each group of nested parentheses and adding it to the vector when a balanced group is found. The use of level to track the nesting level is a good approach.

truncate_number
This function is correct and straightforward. It simply subtracts the integer part of the number from the number itself to obtain the decimal part.

sort_array
This function is mostly correct, but there is a logical error in the sorting condition. The condition should check the sum of the first and last elements of the array, not the first and last elements of the array itself. The correct condition should be: if ((array[0] + array[array.size()-1]) % 2 == 0). Additionally, the function should not modify the original vector, but rather return a new sorted vector.

Here is the corrected version of the sort_array function:

```cpp
vector<int> sort_array(vector<int> array) {
    int sum = array[0] + array[array.size() - 1];
