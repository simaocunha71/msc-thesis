You have some code, and some questions, and I'm not sure what you want.  You want help understanding the code, or help writing some of it, or help with the questions?
If it's the first, I'd recommend starting by reading the comments.  Then, I'd recommend trying to understand the code yourself.  If you get stuck, or have questions, then you can come back with those.
If it's the second, I'd recommend writing the code yourself.  It's a great way to learn.  If you get stuck, then you can come back with the part you're stuck on, and I'll help you get un-stuck.
If it's the third, then I'll do my best to answer your questions.  If you don't understand the answer, then you can come back with your questions, and I'll help you understand it.
For all three, I'd recommend trying to understand what the code is supposed to do.  If you don't understand that, then you won't be able to write it, and you won't understand the code you write.
Good luck!
