A few things to consider:
1) You are using the standard namespace, which is good practice. However, it may lead to conflicts if you include other headers that also use the standard namespace. It would be better to use the scope resolution operator to define which namespace you're using. For example, instead of using namespace std;, you could use std::string instead of string.
2) In the has_close_elements function, you have an infinite loop that will only ever stop when the return statement is reached. This is because you have no break statement in your loop. You should add a break statement after the return statement to exit the loop.
3) In the separate_paren_groups function, you are using a char variable to store each character of the input string. This is not necessary. You can use a string variable to store the current paren group instead.
4) In the truncate_number function, you are using the int() function to convert the number to an integer. However, this will truncate the number, not round it. If you want to round the number, you should use the round() function instead.
5) In the longest function, you are using a string variable to store the longest string. However, you should use a reference to a string variable instead. This will allow you to modify the variable inside the loop.
Here is the corrected code:
#include<stdio.h>
#include<vector>
#include<string>
#include<math.h>
using namespace std;

bool has_close_elements(vector<float> numbers, float threshold){
    for (int i=0;i<numbers.size();i++)
        for (int j=i+1;j<numbers.size();j++)
            if (abs(numbers[i]-numbers[j])<threshold)
                return true;
    return false;
}

vector<string> separate_paren_groups(string paren_string){
    vector<string> all_parens;
    string current_paren;
    int level=0;
    for (int i=0;i<paren_string.length();i++)
    {
        char chr = paren_string[i];
        if (chr=='(')
        {
            level+=1;
            current_paren+=chr;
        }
        if (chr==')')
        {
            level-=1;
            current
