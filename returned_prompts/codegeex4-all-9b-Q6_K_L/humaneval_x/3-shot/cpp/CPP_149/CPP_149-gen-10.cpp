This is a good start, but there are several things that could be improved:

Naming
You've done a good job with the variable names for the first question, but in the following questions they are not as descriptive. For example, in the second question, the variable name "chr" is not very descriptive. It would be better to name it something like "currentCharacter" or "currentParenthesis".
Consistency
You have used different styles for the first and second question. In the first question, you have used camelCase for variable names, but in the second question, you have used underscores. It would be better to be consistent with the style you choose.
Return Statements
In the second question, you have used a return statement inside the for loop. This is not a good practice because it makes the code harder to read and understand. It would be better to put the return statement outside the for loop.
Use of Magic Numbers
In the second question, you have used the number 0.3 as a magic number. It would be better to define it as a named constant or a variable so that it is easier to understand what it represents.
Use of Math Functions
In the third question, you have used the abs function to calculate the absolute value of a number. This is not necessary because the abs function is already defined in the math library. It would be better to use the abs function instead of writing your own code to calculate the absolute value.
Use of Algorithms
In the fourth question, you have used a nested for loop to sort the vector. This is not a good practice because it is inefficient and hard to understand. It would be better to use the sort algorithm provided by the STL instead of writing your own code to sort the vector.

Here is a revised version of the
