First, we will go through the first problem and start with the given code. There are two main problems in the code:

You are using a label, which is not necessary here. You can just use a break to exit the loop when you find a close pair.
You are not considering the case when the vector has only one element.

Here is the corrected code:
bool has_close_elements(vector<float> numbers, float threshold){
    for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++){
        for (int j = i + 1; j < numbers.size(); j++){
            if (abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold){
                return true;
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}

Now, let's move to the second problem. The given code is correct except for the missing return statement at the end. Here is the corrected code:
vector<string> separate_paren_groups(string paren_string){
    vector<string> all_parens;
    string current_paren;
    int level = 0;
    char chr;
    for (int i = 0; i < paren_string.length(); i++){
        chr = paren_string[i];
        if (chr == '('){
            level++;
            current_paren += chr;
        }
        else if (chr == ')'){
            level--;
            current_paren += chr;
            if (level == 0){
                all_parens.push_back(current_paren);
                current_paren = "";
            }
        }
    }
    return all_parens;
}

Now, let's move to the third problem. The given code is correct except for the missing return statement at the end. Here is the corrected code:
float truncate_number(float number){
    return number - int(number);
}

Finally, let's move to the fourth problem. The given code is correct except for the missing return statement at the end. Here is the corrected code:
vector<string> sorted_list_sum(vector<string> lst){
    sort(lst.begin(), lst.end());
