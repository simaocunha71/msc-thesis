It's great that you're using a vector for the results of the second question. However, the first question has a bug in the logic of the for loops. You need to swap the order of the two loops. As it stands, the function will return true if the first element of the vector is within the threshold of any other element of the vector, but it won't check the rest of the elements. The second for loop should be nested within the first for loop.
Here's the corrected code for the first question:
bool has_close_elements(vector<float> numbers, float threshold) {
    for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < numbers.size(); j++) {
            if (abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold) {
                return true;
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}

For the second question, the function is mostly correct, but it doesn't handle the case where the parentheses are not balanced properly. You should add a check to make sure that the level variable is always zero when you reach the end of the string. If it's not, then the parentheses are not balanced properly and you should return an empty vector.
Here's the corrected code for the second question:
vector<string> separate_paren_groups(string paren_string) {
    vector<string> all_parens;
    string current_paren;
    int level = 0;
    char chr;
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < paren_string.length(); i++) {
        chr = paren_string[i];
        if (chr == '(') {
            level +=
