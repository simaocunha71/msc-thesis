has_close_elements

You're missing a closing brace. You also don't need a label A:, and the function can be declared inline with the closing brace.

separate_paren_groups

You're not checking if the parentheses are balanced, or if they're nested within each other.
Also, you're not checking if the input string contains any parentheses at all. If it doesn't, you're going to return an empty vector of strings.

truncate_number

You're using math.h, but you don't need to, because you're using the math function ceil(). You should also be using the floor function instead of int().
You should also be using the fmod function instead of subtracting the integer part from the number. fmod returns the remainder of the division, so it's more correct and more efficient.

sum_squares

You're using math.h, but you don't need to, because you're using the math function pow(). You should also be using the fmod function instead of subtracting the integer part from the number. fmod returns the remainder of the division, so it's more correct and more efficient.
