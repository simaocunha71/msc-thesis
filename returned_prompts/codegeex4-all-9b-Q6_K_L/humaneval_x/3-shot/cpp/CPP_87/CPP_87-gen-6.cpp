You should always provide the full context of the question. Here, you're asking about a programming assignment, but you're not really telling us anything about the requirements or constraints. You're just dumping a bunch of code without any explanation. What are you expecting from us? To point out the mistakes in your code? To provide you with a solution? To write the code for you? To review your code?
To provide you with any meaningful help, I need to know what the requirements are. What does the code need to do? What are the constraints? What are the requirements for the input? What are the requirements for the output? Are there any particular libraries that need to be used? Are there any specific features of the language that need to be used? Are there any specific algorithms that need to be used? Are there any specific data structures that need to be used? Are there any specific optimization goals that need to be met? Are there any specific performance requirements that need to be met? Are there any specific error handling requirements that need to be met? Are there any specific security requirements that need to be met?
Without any of this information, I can only guess at the requirements. And guessing at the requirements is a dangerous game. It's easy to make assumptions that are incorrect, and it's easy to misunderstand the requirements. The result is often a solution that doesn't meet the requirements, or a solution that's inefficient or insecure or buggy.
So, please, provide the full context of the question. What are the requirements? What are the constraints? What are the requirements for the input? What are the requirements for the output? Are there any particular libraries that need to be used? Are there any specific features of the language that need to be used? Are there any specific algorithms that need to be used? Are there any specific data structures that need to be used? Are there any specific optimization goals that need to be met? Are there any specific performance requirements that need to be met? Are there any specific error handling requirements that need to be met? Are there any specific security requirements that need
