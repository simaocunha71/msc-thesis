The code is fine, but there are some things you could do to improve it.

Use descriptive variable names.
For example, in has_close_elements, the variable names i and j are not descriptive at all. You could use something like num1 and num2 instead.
In separate_paren_groups, the variable name chr could be more descriptive, for example, character.
In truncate_number, the variable name number could be more descriptive, for example, number_to_truncate.
In is_multiply_prime, the variable name a could be more descriptive, for example, number_to_check.

Use const where appropriate.
For example, in separate_paren_groups, the variable paren_string should be declared as const, since it is not modified within the function.
In truncate_number, the variable number should be declared as const, since it is not modified within the function.

Use for loops where appropriate.
For example, in has_close_elements, the for loops are fine, but you could also use a for-each loop to iterate over the vector.
In separate_paren_groups, the for loop is fine, but you could also use a for-each loop to iterate over the string.
In truncate_number, the for loop is fine, but you could also use a for-each loop to iterate over the string.
In is_multiply_prime, the for loop is fine, but you could also use a for-each loop to iterate over the vector.

Use the correct return type.
For example, in has_close_elements, the return type should be bool, since the function returns true or false.
In separate_paren_groups, the return type should be vector<string>, since the function returns a vector of strings.
In truncate_number, the return type should be float, since the function returns a float.
In is_multiply_prime, the return type should be bool, since the function returns true or false.

Use the correct data type.
