This problem is a combinatorial optimization problem, and the solution is based on dynamic programming.

The idea is to use a 3D dynamic programming table dp[i][j][k], which represents the minimum path of length k starting from the cell (i, j) of the grid. In other words, dp[i][j][k] is the minimum path of length k starting from the cell (i, j) and visiting any cell of the grid.

The base case of the dynamic programming table is dp[i][j][0] = grid[i][j], which represents the minimum path of length 0 starting from the cell (i, j).

The transition of the dynamic programming table is as follows:

dp[i][j][k] = min(dp[i+1][j][k-1], dp[i-1][j][k-1], dp[i][j+1][k-1], dp[i][j-1][k-1]) + grid[i][j]
where (i+1, j), (i-1, j), (i, j+1), (i, j-1) are the four neighbor cells of the cell (i, j).

The final solution is the minimum path of length k starting from any cell of the grid, which can be computed as:

min(dp[i][j][k]) for all i, j in the grid

The following is the Python code for the solution:

```
def minPath(grid, k):
    n = len(grid)
    dp = [[[float('inf')] * (k+1) for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            dp[i][j][0] = grid[i][j]
    for l in range(1, k+1):
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                if i > 0:
                    dp[i][j][l] = min(dp[i][j][l], dp[i-1][j][l-1] + grid[i][j])
                if i < n-1:
                    dp[i][j][l] = min(dp[i][j][l], dp[i+1][j][l-1] + grid[i][j])
                if j > 0:
                    dp[i][j][l] = min(dp[i][j][l], dp[i][j-1][l-1] + grid
