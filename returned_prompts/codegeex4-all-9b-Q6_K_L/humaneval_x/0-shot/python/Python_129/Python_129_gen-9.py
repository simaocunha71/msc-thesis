This problem can be solved using Depth First Search (DFS) and Priority Queue (Min-Heap).

First, we need to create a graph from the grid. Each cell in the grid will be a node in the graph. The edges between the nodes will be the neighboring cells.

Then, we start a DFS from each node. In each step, we move to a neighboring cell and push the new path to the priority queue. The priority queue is sorted by the lexicographical order of the paths.

We continue the DFS until we reach the path of length k. If we find a path of length k, we return the path. If we exhaust all the possibilities without finding a path of length k, we return an empty list.

Here is the Python code for the solution:

```python
from heapq import heappush, heappop

def minPath(grid, k):
    n = len(grid)
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n * n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if i > 0:
                graph[grid[i][j]].append(grid[i-1][j])
            if i < n-1:
                graph[grid[i][j]].append(grid[i+1][j])
            if j > 0:
                graph[grid[i][j]].append(grid[i][j-1])
            if j < n-1:
                graph[grid[i][j]].append(grid[i][j+1])
    
    heap = []
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            heappush(heap, (grid[i][j], [grid[i][j]]))
    
    while heap:
        val, path = heappop(heap)
        if len(path) == k:
            return path
        for neighbor in graph[val]:
            if neighbor not in path:
                heappush(heap, (neighbor, path + [neighbor]))
    
    return []
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(N^2 log N) and a space complexity of O(N^2).
