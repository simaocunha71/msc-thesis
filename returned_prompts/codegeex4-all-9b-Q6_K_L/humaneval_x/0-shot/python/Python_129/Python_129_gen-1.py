The problem can be solved using a priority queue (heapq in Python). We need to keep track of the current cell, the number of steps we have taken so far, the path we have taken so far, and the values we have seen so far. We start from each cell in the grid and explore all possible paths of length k. We use a heap to keep track of the paths that we have explored so far, so that we can always explore the path with the least lexicographical order first.

Here is the Python code:

```python
import heapq

def minPath(grid, k):
    N = len(grid)
    seen = set()
    pq = []
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            heapq.heappush(pq, (grid[i][j], (i, j), 0, [grid[i][j]]))
    ans = None
    while pq:
        val, (i, j), steps, path = heapq.heappop(pq)
        if (i, j) in seen:
            continue
        seen.add((i, j))
        if steps == k:
            if ans is None or path < ans:
                ans = path
            continue
        for x, y in ((i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1)):
            if 0 <= x < N and 0 <= y < N:
                heapq.heappush(pq, (grid[x][y], (x, y), steps+1, path + [grid[x][y]]))
    return ans
```

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N^2 * k * log(N^2 * k)), where N is the size of the grid and k is the number of steps. The space complexity is O(N^2 * k), since we need to store all the paths that we have explored.
