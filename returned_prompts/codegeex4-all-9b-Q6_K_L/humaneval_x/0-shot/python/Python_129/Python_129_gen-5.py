This problem is a bit tricky, but it can be solved using dynamic programming. The key is to use a 3D array dp to store the minimum path of length i that ends at cell (x, y) in the grid. The value of dp[i][x][y] is the minimum value of the path of length i that ends at cell (x, y).

The algorithm is as follows:

1. Initialize the dp array with infinity for all values.
2. Set dp[0][x][y] = grid[x][y] for all x and y.
3. For i from 1 to k:
   - For x from 0 to N-1:
     - For y from 0 to N-1:
       - For dx from -1 to 1:
         - For dy from -1 to 1:
           - If dx != 0 or dy != 0:
             - If x+dx >= 0 and x+dx < N and y+dy >= 0 and y+dy < N:
               - dp[i][x][y] = min(dp[i][x][y], grid[x][y] + dp[i-1][x+dx][y+dy]).
4. Find the minimum value in dp[k][x][y] for all x and y, and return the corresponding path.

Here is the Python code:

def minPath(grid, k):
    N = len(grid)
    dp = [[[float('inf')] * N for _ in range(N)] for _ in range(k+1)]
    dp[0] = [[grid[x][y] for y in range(N)] for x in range(N)]

    for i in range(1, k+1):
        for x in range(N):
            for y in range(N):
                for dx in range(-1, 2):
                    for dy in range(-1, 2):
                        if dx != 0 or dy != 0:
                            if x+dx >= 0 and x+dx < N and y+dy >= 0 and y+dy < N:
                                dp[i][x][y] = min(dp[i][x][y], grid[x][y] + dp[i-1][x+dx][y+dy])

    min_val = float('inf')
    min_path = []
    for x in range(N):
        for y in range(N):
            if dp[k][x][y] < min_val:
                min
