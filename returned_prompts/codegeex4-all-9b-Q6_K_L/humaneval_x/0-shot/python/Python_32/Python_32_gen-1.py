Your function `poly` is correct. It correctly evaluates the polynomial for a given set of coefficients and a value of `x`.

Your function `find_zero` is also correct. It finds the zero of the polynomial by iteratively applying the Newton-Raphson method. This method is a root-finding algorithm that produces successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function.

Here is the code with some comments to explain the steps:

```python
import math

def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x^2 + .... xs[n] * x^n
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])


def find_zero(xs: list):
    """ xs are coefficients of a polynomial.
    find_zero find x such that poly(x) = 0.
    find_zero returns only only zero point, even if there are many.
    Moreover, find_zero only takes list xs having even number of coefficients
    and largest non zero coefficient as it guarantees
    a solution.
    >>> round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2) # f(x) = 1 + 2x
    -0.5
    >>> round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2) # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
    1.0
    """
    # Initial guess for the root
    x0 = 1.0
    # Maximum number of iterations
    max_iter = 1000
    # Tolerance for convergence
    tol = 1e-6
    
    # Apply Newton-Raphson method
    for _ in range(max_iter):
        fx = poly(xs, x0)
        if abs(fx) < tol:
            return x0
        dfx = poly([i * coeff for i, coeff in enumerate(xs[1:])], x0)
        if dfx == 0:
            raise ZeroDivisionError("Derivative is zero. No solution found.")
        x0 = x0 - fx / dfx

    raise ValueError("No solution found within the maximum number of iterations.")
