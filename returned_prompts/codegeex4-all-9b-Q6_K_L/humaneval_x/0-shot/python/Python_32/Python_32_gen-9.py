The function `find_zero` attempts to find a zero of a polynomial represented by a list of coefficients. However, the implementation of `find_zero` is incorrect and does not follow the mathematical principles to find the zero of a polynomial. 

Here is a revised implementation of `find_zero`:

```python
import numpy as np

def find_zero(xs: list):
    """ xs are coefficients of a polynomial.
    find_zero find x such that poly(x) = 0.
    find_zero returns only only zero point, even if there are many.
    Moreover, find_zero only takes list xs having even number of coefficients
    and largest non zero coefficient as it guarantees
    a solution.
    >>> round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2) # f(x) = 1 + 2x
    -0.5
    >>> round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2) # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
    1.0
    """
    # Create a polynomial object from the coefficients
    p = np.poly1d(xs)

    # Find the roots of the polynomial
    roots = np.roots(p)

    # Return the real root if it exists
    for root in roots:
        if np.isreal(root):
            return root

    # If there are no real roots, return None
    return None
```

This implementation uses the `numpy` library to create a polynomial object and find the roots of the polynomial. It then returns the first real root it finds. If there are no real roots, it returns `None`.

Note that this implementation assumes that the input `xs` is a valid list of coefficients for a polynomial. It does not handle cases where `xs` is not a list or contains invalid elements.
