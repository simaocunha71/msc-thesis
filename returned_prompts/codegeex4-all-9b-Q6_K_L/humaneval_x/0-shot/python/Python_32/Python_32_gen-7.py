The function `find_zero` is designed to find a zero of a polynomial defined by the coefficients in the list `xs`. However, the current implementation of `find_zero` does not actually perform any computation to find a zero. Instead, it simply returns the first coefficient of the list, which is not correct.

To implement `find_zero`, we can use a numerical method such as the bisection method or Newton's method. Here's an example of how to use the bisection method to find a zero of a polynomial:

```python
def bisection(f, a, b, tol=1e-6):
    """
    Find a zero of a function f in the interval [a, b] using the bisection method.
    """
    while b - a > tol:
        c = (a + b) / 2
        if f(c) == 0:
            return c
        elif f(a) * f(c) < 0:
            b = c
        else:
            a = c
    return (a + b) / 2

def find_zero(xs):
    """
    Find a zero of a polynomial defined by the coefficients in the list xs.
    """
    # Define the function to find a zero for
    def f(x):
        return poly(xs, x)

    # Find the interval [a, b] containing a zero
    a = -10
    b = 10
    while f(a) * f(b) > 0:
        a *= 2
        b *= 2

    # Use the bisection method to find a zero
    return bisection(f, a, b)
```

In this example, we first define a function `bisection` that uses the bisection method to find a zero of a function `f` in the interval `[a, b]`. Then, in the `find_zero` function, we define the function `f` as the polynomial defined by the coefficients in `xs`, and we use the `bisection` function to find a zero of `f` in the interval `[-10, 10]`. We then return the value of the zero found by the `bisection` function.

Note that this implementation of `find_zero` is not guaranteed to find a zero of the polynomial, and it may not find a zero if the polynomial has no real roots. Additionally, the interval `[a, b]` in which
