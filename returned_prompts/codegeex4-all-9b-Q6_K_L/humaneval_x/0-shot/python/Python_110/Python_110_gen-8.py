Explanation:

This function takes two lists as input: lst1 and lst2. It first removes all odd numbers from lst1 and all even numbers from lst2. Then it compares the lengths of the two lists. If the length of lst1 is less than or equal to the length of lst2, it returns "YES". Otherwise, it returns "NO".

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the longer list. The space complexity is also O(n), as we are creating new lists to store the odd and even numbers.
