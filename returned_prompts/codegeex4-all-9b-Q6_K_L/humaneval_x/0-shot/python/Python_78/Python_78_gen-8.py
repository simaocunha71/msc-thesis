def hex_key(num):
    """You have been tasked to write a function that receives 
    a hexadecimal number as a string and counts the number of hexadecimal 
    digits that are primes (prime number, or a prime, is a natural number 
    greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers).
    Hexadecimal digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F.
    Prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17,...
    So you have to determine a number of the following digits: 2, 3, 5, 7, 
    B (=decimal 11), D (=decimal 13).
    Note: you may assume the input is always correct or empty string, 
    and symbols A,B,C,D,E,F are always uppercase.
    Examples:
    For num = "AB" the output should be 1.
    For num = "1077E" the output should be 2.
    For num = "ABED1A33" the output should be 4.
    For num = "123456789ABCDEF0" the output should be 6.
    For num = "2020" the output should be 2.
    """
    primes = {'2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D'}
    return sum(1 for digit in num if digit in primes)

print(hex_key("AB")) # 1
print(hex_key("1077E")) # 2
print(hex_key("ABED1A33")) # 4
print(hex_key("123456789ABCDEF0")) # 6
print(hex_key("2020")) # 2

The function hex_key() takes a hexadecimal number as a string and counts the number of hexadecimal digits that are primes. It returns the count.

The function hex_key() uses a set primes to store the hexadecimal digits that are primes. It then uses a generator expression to iterate over each digit in the input string num and checks if the digit is in the set primes. If it is, it adds 1 to the count. Finally, it returns the count.
