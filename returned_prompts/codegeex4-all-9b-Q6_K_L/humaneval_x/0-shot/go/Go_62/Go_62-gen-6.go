The polynomial can be represented by a slice of integers, where each integer represents the coefficient of the corresponding power of x. For example, the polynomial 3x^4 + 2x^3 + 5x^2 + 4x + 1 can be represented by the slice [3, 2, 5, 4, 1].

To find the derivative of a polynomial, we can use the power rule of differentiation, which states that the derivative of x^n is nx^(n-1). Therefore, the derivative of a polynomial can be found by multiplying each coefficient by its corresponding power and then reducing the power by 1.

Here's how you can implement the Derivative function:

```go
func Derivative(xs []int) []int {
    derivative := make([]int, len(xs)-1)
    for i := 1; i < len(xs); i++ {
        derivative[i-1] = xs[i] * i
    }
    return derivative
}
```

In this implementation, we create a new slice of integers called derivative with a length of len(xs)-1, since the derivative of a polynomial of degree n is a polynomial of degree n-1. We then iterate over the coefficients of the original polynomial, starting from the second coefficient (index 1), and multiply each coefficient by its corresponding power (i) and store the result in the corresponding index of the derivative slice. Finally, we return the derivative slice.
