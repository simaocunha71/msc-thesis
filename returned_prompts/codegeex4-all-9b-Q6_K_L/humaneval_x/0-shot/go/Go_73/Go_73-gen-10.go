```go
// This is a function that finds the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array palindromic.
// It takes in an array of integers as an argument and returns an integer.
func SmallestChange(arr []int) int {
    // Initialize a variable to keep track of the number of changes needed.
    changes := 0
    
    // Loop through the array from both ends towards the center.
    for i := 0; i < len(arr)/2; i++ {
        // If the elements at the current positions are not equal, increment the changes variable and set the element at the current position to the element at the corresponding position on the other side of the array.
        if arr[i] != arr[len(arr)-1-i] {
            changes++
