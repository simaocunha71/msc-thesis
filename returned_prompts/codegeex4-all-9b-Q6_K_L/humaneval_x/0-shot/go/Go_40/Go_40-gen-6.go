// To solve the problem, we can use a combination of sorting and the two-pointer technique. The basic idea is to sort the list first and then iterate through it. For each element, we use two pointers, one starting from the next element and the other from the end of the list, to find a pair that sums to the negative of the current element. If such a pair is found, we return true. If we reach the end of the list without finding any such pairs, we return false.

Here's the solution:

```go
func TriplesSumToZero(l []int) bool {
    // Sort the list
    sort.Ints(l)

    // Iterate through the list
    for i := 0; i < len(l)-2; i++ {
        // Initialize two pointers
        left, right := i+1, len(l)-1

        // Use two-pointer technique to find a pair that sums to the negative of the current element
        for left < right {
            sum := l[i] + l[left] + l[right]

            // If the sum is zero, we found a triple
            if sum == 0 {
                return true
            }

            // If the sum is less than zero, move the left pointer to the right
            if sum < 0 {
                left++
            } else {
                // If the sum is greater than zero, move the right pointer to the left
                right--
            }
        }
    }

    // If we reach this point, no triple was found
    return false
}
```

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) because we have to iterate through the list twice (once for sorting and once for the two-pointer technique). The space complexity is O(1) because we only use a constant amount of extra space for the two pointers.
