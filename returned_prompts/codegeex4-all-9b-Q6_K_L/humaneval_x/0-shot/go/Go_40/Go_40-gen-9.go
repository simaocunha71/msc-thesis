Your implementation of `TriplesSumToZero` is correct. It sorts the input list and then uses a two-pointer approach to find three numbers that sum to zero. This approach has a time complexity of O(n^2), which is efficient for this problem.

Here is a brief explanation of how your code works:

1. `sort.Ints(l)
