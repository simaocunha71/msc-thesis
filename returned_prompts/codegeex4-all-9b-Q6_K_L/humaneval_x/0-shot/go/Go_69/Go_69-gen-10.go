You can use a map to count the frequency of each integer in the list, then iterate through the map to find the greatest integer that has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself. If no such value exists, return -1.

Here is the solution in Go:

```go
func Search(lst []int) int {
    frequency := make(map[int]int)
    for _, num := range lst {
        frequency[num]++
    }
    for num, count := range frequency {
        if num >= count {
            return num
        }
    }
    return -1
}
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the list.
