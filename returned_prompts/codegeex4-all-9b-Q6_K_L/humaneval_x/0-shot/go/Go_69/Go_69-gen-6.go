To solve this problem, we need to first count the frequency of each integer in the list. Then, we can iterate through the list again and find the greatest integer that has a frequency greater than or equal to its value. If no such integer exists, we return -1.

Here is the code:

```go
func Search(lst []int) int {
    // Count the frequency of each integer
    freq := make(map[int]int)
    for _, num := range lst {
        freq[num]++
    }

    // Find the greatest integer with frequency >= its value
    max := -1
    for num, count := range freq {
        if count >= num && num > max {
            max = num
        }
    }

    return max
}
```

This code first creates a map `freq` to count the frequency of each integer. Then, it iterates through the map and checks if the frequency of each integer is greater than or equal to its value. If it is, and the integer is greater than the current maximum, it updates the maximum. Finally, it returns the maximum or -1 if no such integer exists.
