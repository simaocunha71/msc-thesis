You can solve this problem by using a map to count the frequency of each number in the list, and then iterating over the map to find the greatest number with a frequency greater than or equal to its value. If no such number exists, you can return -1.

Here is the implementation in Go:

```go
func Search(lst []int) int {
    freq := make(map[int]int)

    // Count the frequency of each number
    for _, num := range lst {
        freq[num]++
    }

    // Find the greatest number with a frequency greater than or equal to its value
    max := -1
    for num, count := range freq {
        if count >= num && num > max {
            max = num
        }
    }

    return max
}
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the list.
