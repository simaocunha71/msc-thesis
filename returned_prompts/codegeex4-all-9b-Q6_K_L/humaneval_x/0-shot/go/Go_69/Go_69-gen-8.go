The solution is as follows:

```go
func Search(lst []int) int {
    // create a map to store the frequency of each number
    freq := make(map[int]int)
    // iterate through the list and update the frequency map
    for _, num := range lst {
        freq[num]++
    }
    // iterate through the list again and find the greatest integer with a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself
    for _, num := range lst {
        if freq[num] >= num {
            return num
        }
    }
    // if no such integer exists, return -1
    return -1
}
```

This solution uses a map to store the frequency of each number in the list. It then iterates through the list again and checks if the frequency of each number is greater than or equal to the value of the number itself. If such a number is found, it is returned. If no such number exists, -1 is returned.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the list.
