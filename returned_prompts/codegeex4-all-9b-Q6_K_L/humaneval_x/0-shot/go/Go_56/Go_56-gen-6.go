The provided solution is checking the length of the string and comparing it with the length of the string obtained after removing all '<' and '>' characters. This approach assumes that if the remaining string is empty, it means that all brackets are correctly paired. However, this logic is flawed because it doesn't account for scenarios where the brackets are out of order or nested incorrectly.

Here's an improved solution that correctly checks for balanced brackets:

```go
func CorrectBracketing(brackets string) bool {
    stack := []rune{}

    for _, c := range brackets {
        if c == '<' {
            stack = append(stack, c)
        } else if len(stack) == 0 || stack[len(stack)-1] != '<' {
            return false
        } else {
            stack = stack[:len(stack)-1]
        }
    }

    return len(stack) == 0
}
```

This solution uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets. When an opening bracket is encountered, it is pushed onto the stack. When a closing bracket is encountered, the function checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack is an opening bracket. If so, the opening bracket is popped off the stack. If not, it means the brackets are not balanced, and the function returns `false`. Finally, the function checks if the stack is empty, which would indicate that all opening brackets have been properly closed, and returns `true` if so, or `false` otherwise.
