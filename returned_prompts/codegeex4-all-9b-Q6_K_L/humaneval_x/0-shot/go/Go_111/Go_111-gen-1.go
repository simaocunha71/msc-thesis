Here is the solution in Go:

```go
func Histogram(test string) map[rune]int {
    if test == "" {
        return map[rune]int{}
    }
    hist := make(map[rune]int)
    for _, c := range test {
        hist[c]++
    }
    max := 0
    for _, v := range hist {
        if v > max {
            max = v
        }
    }
    result := make(map[rune]int)
    for k, v := range hist {
        if v == max {
            result[k] = max
        }
    }
    return result
}
```

The function `Histogram` first checks if the input string is empty. If it is, it returns an empty map.

Then it creates a map `hist` to store the frequency of each character in the string.

Next, it iterates through each character in the string and increments the corresponding count in the map.

After that, it finds the maximum count in the map.

Finally, it creates another map `result` and adds the characters with the maximum count to it.

The function returns the `result` map, which contains the characters with the most repetition and their corresponding counts.
