The provided Go code correctly implements the FizzBuzz function, which counts the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than `n` that are divisible by either 11 or 13. The function iterates from 1 to `n-1`, checking for divisibility by 11 or 13 and counting the occurrences of the digit 7 in those numbers. The function uses the `strings.Count` function from the `strings` package to count the occurrences of the digit 7 in the string representation of the number. 

Here's an explanation of the code:

1. `count := 0` initializes a counter variable `count` to 0. This variable will be used to keep track of the number of times the digit 7 appears in the integers we are considering.

2. `for i := 1; i < n; i++ {` starts a loop that iterates from 1 to `n-1`. This loop will check each integer in this range.

3. `if i%11 == 0 || i%13 == 0 {` checks if the current integer `i` is divisible by either 11 or 13. If this condition is true, the code inside the `if` block will be executed.

4. `count += strings.Count(strconv.Itoa(i), "7")` converts the current integer `i` to a string using `strconv.Itoa(i)`, then counts the occurrences of the digit 7 in that string using `strings.Count`. The result is added to the `count` variable.

5. `return count` returns the final value of the `count` variable, which is the number of times the digit 7 appears in the integers less than `n` that are divisible by either 11 or 13.

The code is correct and should produce the expected results for the given examples.
