The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where a number is found by adding up the two numbers before it. Starting with 0 and 1, the sequence goes 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so forth.

In the function `Fib(n int) int`, the base case is when `n` is either 0 or 1. If `n` is 0, the function returns 0. If `n` is 1, the function returns 1.

For any other value of `n`, the function calls itself recursively with the arguments `n-1` and `n-2`, and returns the sum of these two function calls. This is the recursive definition of the Fibonacci sequence.

The other options are incorrect because:

B: The Fibonacci sequence is not defined as the sum of the two numbers after it. It is defined as the sum of the two numbers before it.

C: The Fibonacci sequence is not defined as the difference of the two numbers before it. It is defined as the sum of the two numbers before it.

D: The Fibonacci sequence is not defined as the sum of the two numbers before the current one. It is defined as the sum
