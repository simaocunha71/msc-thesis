The Tribonacci sequence is a generalization of the Fibonacci sequence where each term is the sum of the three preceding terms. The sequence starts with 3 as the first term, and for even indices, each term is calculated as 1 plus half the index. For odd indices, each term is the sum of the three preceding terms.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize an empty slice `result` of type `[]float64` with a length of `n+1` to store the Tribonacci sequence.
2. Set the first term of `result` to 3, as per the definition of the sequence.
3. Iterate over the range `0` to `n` using a `for` loop:
   - If the index `i` is even, calculate the `i`-th term by adding 1 to half of `i` and assign it to `result[i]`.
   - If the index `i` is odd, calculate the `i`-th term by summing the `i-1`-th, `i-2`-th, and `i-3`-th terms of `result` and assign it to `result[i]`.
4. Return the `result` slice.

Here's the complete code:

```go
func Tri(n int) []float64 {
    result := make([]float64, n+1)
    result[0] = 3
    for i := 0; i <= n; i++ {
        if i%2 == 0 {
            result[i] = 1 + float64(i)/2
        } else {
            result[i] = result[i-1] + result[i-2] + result[i-3]
        }
    }
    return result
}
```

This code correctly implements the Tribonacci sequence as described in the problem statement.
