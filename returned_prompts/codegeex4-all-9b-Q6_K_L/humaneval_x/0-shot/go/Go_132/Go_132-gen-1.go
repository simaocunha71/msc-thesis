You can use a stack to solve this problem. The idea is to push all opening brackets onto the stack. When a closing bracket is encountered, check if the stack is empty. If it is empty, return false because there is no opening bracket to match the closing bracket. If the stack is not empty, pop the top element from the stack and continue checking the rest of the string. If the stack becomes empty at any point, return true because there is a nested subsequence of brackets.

Here is the modified code:

```go
func IsNested(s string) bool {
	stack := []rune{}
	for _, c := range s {
		if c == '[' {
			stack = append(stack, c)
		} else if c == ']' {
			if len(stack) == 0 {
				return false
			}
			stack = stack[:len(stack)-1]
			if len(stack) == 0 {
				return true
			}
		}
	}
	return false
}
```

This code should pass all the tests.
