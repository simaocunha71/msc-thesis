// Given two lists operator, and operand. The first list has basic algebra operations, and
// the second list is a list of integers. Use the two given lists to build the algebric
// expression and return the evaluation of this expression.
// 
// The basic algebra operations:
// Addition ( + )
// Subtraction ( - )
// Multiplication ( * )
// Floor division ( // )
// Exponentiation ( ** )
// 
// Example:
// operator['+', '*', '-']
// array = [2, 3, 4, 5]
// result = 2 + 3 * 4 - 5
// => result = 9
// 
// Note:
// The length of operator list is equal to the length of operand list minus one.
// Operand is a list of of non-negative integers.
// Operator list has at least one operator, and operand list has at least two operands.

The provided Go code snippet correctly implements a function `DoAlgebra` that takes two slices: `operator` and `operand`. These slices represent the operators (+, -, *, //, **) and operands (integers) respectively.

The function initializes the result with the first operand. Then, it iterates over the operator slice. For each operator, it performs the corresponding operation with the next operand in the operand slice. The result is updated with each operation. Finally, the function returns the result.

The code handles the basic algebra operations correctly, but there is a mistake in handling the floor division (`//`). In Go, `//` is the integer division operator, not the floor division operator. Go doesn't have a floor division operator for integers. Instead, you can use `math.Floor` to achieve floor division for floating-point numbers. However, since the operands are integers
