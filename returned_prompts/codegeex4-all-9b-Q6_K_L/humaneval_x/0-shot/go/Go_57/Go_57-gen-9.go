You can solve this problem using the following approach:

1. Initialize a variable `increasing` to `true` and `decreasing` to `true`.
2. Iterate through the list `l` using a for loop.
3. Inside the loop, check if the current element is greater than the next element. If so, set `increasing` to `false` and break the loop.
4. If the loop completes without setting `increasing` to `false`, check if the current element is less than the next element. If so, set `decreasing` to `false` and break the loop.
5. If both `increasing` and `decreasing` are still `true` at the end of the loop, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

Here's the code:

```go
func Monotonic(l []int) bool {
    increasing := true
    decreasing := true

    for i := 0; i < len(l)-1; i++ {
        if l[i] > l[i+1] {
            increasing = false
            break
        }
    }

    for i := 0; i < len(l)-1; i++ {
        if l[i] < l[i+1] {
            decreasing = false
            break
        }
    }

    return increasing || decreasing
}
```

This code will return `true` if the list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing, and `false` otherwise.
