The function Monotonic checks if the elements of a list are either monotonically increasing or decreasing.
Here is the solution:

```go
func Monotonic(l []int) bool {
    // Check if the list is empty
    if len(l) == 0 {
        return false
    }
    
    // Check if the list has only one element
    if len(l) == 1 {
        return true
    }
    
    // Check if the list is monotonically increasing
    increasing := true
    for i := 1; i < len(l); i++ {
        if l[i] < l[i-1] {
            increasing = false
            break
        }
    }
    
    // Check if the list is monotonically decreasing
    decreasing := true
    for i := 1; i < len(l); i++ {
        if l[i] > l[i-1] {
            decreasing = false
            break
        }
    }
    
    // Return true if the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing
    return increasing || decreasing
}
```

The function first checks if the list is empty or has only one element. If the list is empty or has only one element, the function returns false.

The function then checks if the list is monotonically increasing. It does this by iterating through the list and comparing each element with the previous element. If any element is smaller than the previous element, the function sets the increasing flag to false and breaks out of the loop.

The function then checks if the list is monotonically decreasing. It does this by iterating through the list and comparing each element with the previous element. If any element is larger than the previous element, the function sets the decreasing flag to false and breaks out of the loop.

Finally, the function returns true if the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing, and false otherwise.
