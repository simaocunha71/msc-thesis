The function XOrY(n, x, y int) int is not correct because the prime number check is not implemented. The function should check if n is a prime number and if it is, return x, otherwise return y.

Here's the correct code:

func XOrY(n, x, y int) int {
    for i := 2; i < n; i++ {
        if n%i == 0 {
            return y
        }
    }
    return x
}

The function checks if n is divisible by any number between 2 and n-1. If n is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not a prime number and the function returns y. If n is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is a prime number and the function returns x.

Here's an example of how to use the function:

func main() {
    fmt.Println(XOrY(7, 34, 12)) // Output: 34
    fmt.Println(XOrY(15, 8, 5))  // Output: 5
}
