The `EncodeShift` function is designed to encode a string by shifting every character by 5 positions in the alphabet. The `DecodeShift` function is intended to reverse this process, returning the original string. However, there is a mistake in the `DecodeShift` function. 

Here's the corrected version of the `DecodeShift` function:

```go
func DecodeShift(s string) string {
    runes := []rune(s)
    newRunes := make([]rune, 0)
    for _, ch := range runes {
        newRunes = append(newRunes, (ch-5-'a')%26+'a')
    }
    return string(runes)
}
```

The key mistake in the original `DecodeShift` function was that it used the same formula as `EncodeShift`, effectively shifting each character by an additional 5 positions. To decode the string, we need to shift each character back by 5 positions, which means subtracting 5 from the current character's position in the alphabet. Here's the corrected line of code:

```go
newRunes = append(newRunes, (ch-5-'a')%26+'a')
```

In this corrected line, `(ch-5-'a')` calculates the original position of the character in the alphabet, subtracts 5 to get the decoded position, and then adds `'a'` to convert it back to a rune. The `%26` ensures that the result wraps around correctly within the alphabet.

With this correction, the `DecodeShift` function will correctly reverse the encoding performed by `EncodeShift`, producing the original string.
