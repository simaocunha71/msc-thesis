// The solution for the problem is as follows:
// 
// The key observation is that for any integer x, x mod 3 can only be 0, 1, or 2.
// Therefore, a[i] mod 3 can only be 0, 1, or 2.
// We can count the number of elements in a that have each of these three values.
// Let c0 be the number of elements in a that have a value of 0 mod 3,
// c1 be the number of elements in a that have a value of 1 mod 3,
// and c2 be the number of elements in a that have a value of 2 mod 3.
// 
// Now, for any triple (a[i], a[j], a[k]) where i < j < k, the sum a[i] + a[j] + a[k]
// is a multiple of 3 if and only if the sum of the values of i, j, and k mod 3 is 0.
// This means that i, j, and k must all have the same value mod 3.
// 
// There are three cases to consider:
// 
// Case 1: All three elements have a value of 0 mod 3.
// In this case, the sum of the values of i, j, and k mod 3 is 0,
// so the triple is valid.
// The number of such triples is c0 * (c0 - 1) * (c0 - 2) / 6,
// since we need to choose three elements from c0 elements.
// 
// Case 2: All three elements have a value of 1 mod 3.
// In this case, the sum of the values of i, j, and k mod 3 is 0,
// so the triple is valid.
// The number of such triples is c1 * (c1 - 1) * (c1 - 2) / 6,
// since we need to choose three elements from c1 elements.
// 
// Case 3: All three elements have a value of 2 mod 3.
// In this case, the sum of the values of i, j, and k mod 3 is 0,
// so the triple is valid.
// The number of such triples is c2 * (c2 - 1) * (c2 - 2) / 6,
// since we
