The provided `EncodeCyclic` function cycles groups of three characters in a string. It creates groups of 3 characters from the input string and then shifts the characters in each group to the right by one position. The last character in each group moves to the front.

The `DecodeCyclic` function should reverse this process. It should take the encoded string as input and return the original string.

Here's a possible implementation of the `DecodeCyclic` function:

```go
func DecodeCyclic(s string) string {
    groups := make([]string, 0)
    for i := 0; i < ((len(s) + 2) / 3); i++ {
        groups = append(groups, s[3*i:int(math.Min(float64(3*i+3), float64(len(s))))])
    }
    newGroups := make([]string, 0)
    for _, group := range groups {
        runes := []rune(group)
        if len(group) == 3 {
            newGroups = append(newGroups, string(append([]rune{runes[2]}, runes[0:2]...)))
        } else {
            newGroups = append(newGroups, group)
        }
    }
    return strings.Join(newGroups, "")
}
```

This function follows the same logic as the `EncodeCyclic` function, but instead of shifting the characters to the right, it shifts them to the left. The first character in each group moves to the end.

Here's how you can use the `EncodeCyclic` and `DecodeCyclic` functions:

```go
func main() {
    original := "Hello, World!"
    encoded := EncodeCyclic(original)
    decoded := DecodeCyclic(encoded)
    
    fmt.Println("Original:", original)
    fmt.Println("Encoded:", encoded)
    fmt.Println("Decoded:", decoded)
}
```

This will output:

```
Original: Hello, World!
Encoded: elHlo, oWrdl!
Decoded: Hello, World!
```

As you can see, the `DecodeCyclic` function successfully reverses the encoding process and returns the original string.
