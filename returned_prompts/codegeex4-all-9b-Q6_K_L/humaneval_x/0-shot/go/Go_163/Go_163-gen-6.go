The provided code is attempting to solve the problem of generating even digits between two positive integers `a` and `b`. However, the code has a logical error in the loop condition and the logic to check if a number is even. Additionally, the code does not correctly handle the case where `a` is greater than `b`.

Here's a corrected version of the code with a detailed explanation:

```go
// GenerateIntegers returns a slice of even digits between a and b.
func GenerateIntegers(a, b int) []int {
    // Determine the start and end of the range based on the values of a and b.
    var start, end int
    if a <= b {
        start = a
        end = b
    } else {
        start = b
        end = a
    }

    var evenDigits []int
    // Iterate over the range from start to end (inclusive).
    for i := start; i <= end; i++ {
        // Check each digit of the number i.
        for j := i; j > 0; j /= 10 {
            digit := j % 10
            // If the digit is even, append it to the slice.
            if digit%2 == 0 {
                evenDigits = append(evenDigits, digit)
            }
        }
    }

    return evenDigits
}
```

### Key Points in the Explanation:

1. **Range Determination**: The code first determines the correct range of numbers to iterate over. If `a` is less than or equal to `b`, the range is from `a` to `b`. Otherwise, it's from `b` to `a`.

2. **Outer Loop**: The outer loop iterates over the numbers from `start` to `end`.

3. **Inner Loop**: For each number `i`, the inner loop checks each digit by repeatedly taking the remainder when divided by 10 (`j % 10`).

4. **Even Digit Check**: If a digit is even (i.e., `digit % 2 == 0`), it is appended to the `evenDigits` slice.

5. **Return Value**: Finally, the function returns the slice of even digits.

This corrected code should now correctly generate a slice of even digits between two given integers in ascending order, handling both cases where `a` is less than or equal to `b` and where `a` is greater than `b`.
