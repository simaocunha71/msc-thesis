```go
func SortEven(l []int) []int {
    odd := l[1::2]
    even := l[0::2]
    sort.Ints(even)
    ans := make([]int, len(l))
    for i := range ans {
        if i%2 == 0 {
            ans[i] = even[i/2]
        } else {
            ans[i] = odd[(i-1)/2]
        }
    }
    return ans
}
```

The provided solution is correct. It separates the odd and even indexed elements, sorts the even indexed elements, and then constructs a new slice where the even indexed elements are the sorted even indexed elements from the original slice and the odd indexed elements are the odd indexed elements from the original slice. The indices are calculated based on the original index modulo 2. 

The function `SortEven` takes a slice of integers `l` as input and returns a new slice of integers. The new slice has the same length as the input slice and the same odd indexed elements as the input slice. The even indexed elements of the new slice are the even indexed elements of the input slice sorted in ascending order. 

Here's a detailed explanation of the code:

1. `odd := l[1::2]` - This line creates a new slice `odd` that contains all the odd indexed elements of the input slice `l`. The slice notation `l[1::2]` means "start at index 1, take every second element until the end".

2. `even := l[0::2]` - This line creates a new slice `even` that contains all the even indexed elements of the input slice `l`. The slice notation `l[0::2]` means "start at index 0, take every second element until the end".

3. `sort.Ints(even)` - This line sorts the `even` slice in ascending order.

4. `ans := make([]int, len(l))` - This line creates a new slice `ans` with the same length as the input slice `l`.

5. The `for` loop iterates over the indices of the `ans` slice. For each index `i`, if `i` is even, the corresponding element in `ans` is set to the element at index `i/2` in the `even` slice. If `i` is odd, the corresponding element in `ans` is set to the element
