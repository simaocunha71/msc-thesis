You are correct that the code you provided has an error. The issue is with the condition in the for loop. You are checking if the index is even, but you should be checking if the index is odd and if the element at that index is odd as well. Here is the corrected code:

```go
func Solution(lst []int) int {
    sum := 0
    for i, v := range lst {
        if i%2 == 1 && v%2 == 1 {
            sum += v
        }
    }
    return sum
}
```

This code iterates over the list of integers and checks if the index is odd and the element at that index is odd as well. If both conditions are true, it adds the element to the sum. Finally, it returns the sum of all the odd elements that are in even positions.
