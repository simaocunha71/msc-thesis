The function `FindZero` is supposed to find a zero of the polynomial represented by the coefficients in the list `xs`. The polynomial is evaluated using the `Poly` function. However, there are a few issues with the implementation of `FindZero`:

1. **Bisection Method**: The implementation of `FindZero` uses a bisection method to find a zero. However, the bisection method requires two initial guesses, `a` and `b`, such that `Poly(a) * Poly(b) < 0`. The implementation does not provide these initial guesses, which means that the function may not always find a zero.

2. **Precision**: The implementation uses a fixed precision of `0.000001` to determine when a zero has been found. This may not be sufficient for all polynomials, especially those with very small or very large coefficients.

3. **Even Number of Coefficients**: The implementation only works for lists `xs` with an even number of coefficients. This is because the function assumes that the largest non-zero coefficient is at the end of the list, which is only true for polynomials with an even number of coefficients.

4. **Largest Non-Zero Coefficient**: The implementation assumes that the largest non-zero coefficient is at the end of the list `xs`. This is not always true, especially for polynomials with negative coefficients.

Here is a revised implementation of `FindZero` that addresses these issues:

```go
import (
    "math"
)

// Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
// return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x^2 + .... xs[n] * x^n
func Poly(xs []int, x float64) float64 {
    sum := 0.0
    for i, coeff := range xs {
        sum += float64(coeff) * math.Pow(x, float64(i))
    }
    return sum
}

// FindZero finds a zero of the polynomial represented by the coefficients in the list xs.
// FindZero returns only one zero point, even if there are many.
func FindZero(xs []int) float64 {
    // Find the largest non-zero coefficient.
    maxCoeff := 0
    for _, coeff := range xs {
        if coeff != 0 && abs(coeff) > abs(maxCoeff) {
            maxCoeff = coeff
        }
    }

    // Set initial guesses for the bisection method.
    a := -
