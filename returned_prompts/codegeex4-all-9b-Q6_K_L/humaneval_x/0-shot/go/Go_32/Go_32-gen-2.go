The function `FindZero` is trying to find a zero of a polynomial defined by a list of coefficients `xs`. However, the implementation is incorrect because it does not actually solve the polynomial equation. Instead, it just returns the first element of the list, which is not necessarily a zero of the polynomial. 

Here's a corrected version of the `FindZero` function that uses the `Poly` function to find a zero of the polynomial:

```go
import (
    "math"
)

// Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
// return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x^2 + .... xs[n] * x^n
func Poly(xs []int, x float64) float64 {
    sum := 0.0
    for i, coeff := range xs {
        sum += float64(coeff) * math.Pow(x, float64(i))
    }
    return sum
}

// FindZero finds a zero of the polynomial defined by the coefficients in xs.
func FindZero(xs []int) float64 {
    // Initialize the left and right bounds for the bisection method
    left := -10.0
    right := 10.0

    // Iterate until the difference between left and right is small enough
    for right-left > 1e-6 {
        // Find the midpoint of the current interval
        mid := (left + right) / 2

        // Evaluate the polynomial at the midpoint
        value := Poly(xs, mid)

        // If the value is close enough to zero, return the midpoint
        if math.Abs(value) < 1e-6 {
            return mid
        }

        // If the value is positive, move the left bound to the midpoint
        if value > 0 {
            left = mid
        } else {
            // Otherwise, move the right bound to the midpoint
            right = mid
        }
    }

    // Return the midpoint as an approximation of the zero
    return (left + right) / 2
}
```

This version of `FindZero` uses the bisection method to find a zero of the polynomial. The bisection method is a simple and effective root-finding algorithm that works by repeatedly dividing an interval in half and checking which half contains a zero of the polynomial. The algorithm continues until the difference between the left and right bounds is small enough, which means that the zero has been found to a desired accuracy
