The code is trying to solve the problem of detecting if the balance of an account falls below zero at any point in time. However, the code is not working as expected because it does not properly track the balance of the account.

Here's a corrected version of the code:

```go
func BelowZero(operations []int) bool {
    balance := 0
    for _, op := range operations {
        balance += op
        if balance < 0 {
            return true
        }
    }
    return false
}
```

This version of the code initializes a variable `balance` to 0, and then iterates over the `operations` slice. For each operation, it adds the value of the operation to the `balance`. If the `balance` becomes negative, it returns `true` immediately. If the loop completes without the `balance` becoming negative, it returns `false` at the end.
