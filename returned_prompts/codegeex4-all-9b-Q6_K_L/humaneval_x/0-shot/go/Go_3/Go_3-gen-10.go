The problem you're asking about is a common algorithmic challenge in programming. It involves iterating through a list of operations (either deposits or withdrawals) and keeping track of the balance. The goal is to determine if at any point the balance becomes negative, indicating an overdraft situation.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how you can solve this problem:

1. Initialize a variable `balance` to 0. This will keep track of the current balance after each operation.
2. Iterate through the `operations` list.
3. For each operation, add the value to `balance` if it's a deposit (positive number), or subtract the value if it's a withdrawal (negative number).
4. After updating the `balance` for each operation, check if `balance` is less than 0.
5. If it is, return `true` immediately, indicating that the account balance has gone below zero at some point.
6. If the loop completes without finding a negative balance, return `false`, indicating that the account never overdrafts.

Here's how you can implement this logic in Go:

```go
func BelowZero(operations []int) bool {
    balance := 0
    for _, op := range operations {
        balance += op
        if balance < 0 {
            return true
        }
    }
    return false
}
```

In this code:

- `balance` is initialized to 0.
- We loop through each `op` in the `operations` slice.
- For each operation, we add or subtract its value from `balance`.
- If at any point `balance` becomes negative, we return `true` immediately.
- If we finish iterating through all operations without `balance` going negative, we return `false`.

This function efficiently checks for a negative balance after a series of operations and returns the appropriate result.
