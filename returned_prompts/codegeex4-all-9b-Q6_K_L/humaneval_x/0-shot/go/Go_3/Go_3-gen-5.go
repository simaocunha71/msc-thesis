You can iterate through the operations and keep track of the balance. If the balance falls below zero at any point, return true. Otherwise, return false.

Here's an example implementation:

```
func BelowZero(operations []int) bool {
    balance := 0
    for _, op := range operations {
        balance += op
        if balance < 0 {
            return true
        }
    }
    return false
}
```

This implementation starts with a balance of 0 and iterates through the operations. For each operation, it adds or subtracts the value from the balance. If the balance falls below zero at any point, it returns true. If the loop completes without the balance falling below zero, it returns false.
