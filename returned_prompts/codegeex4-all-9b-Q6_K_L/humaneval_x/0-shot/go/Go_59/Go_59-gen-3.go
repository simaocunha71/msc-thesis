The largest prime factor of a number is the largest prime number that divides it evenly. In other words, it is the largest number that can divide the number without leaving a remainder.

To find the largest prime factor of a number, we can start by dividing the number by 2 (since 2 is the smallest prime number). If the number is divisible by 2, we divide it by 2 and repeat the process. If the number is not divisible by 2, we move on to the next prime number (which is 3) and repeat the process.

We continue this process until we find the largest prime number that divides the number evenly. This prime number is the largest prime factor of the number.

Here is the code for the function LargestPrimeFactor:

```
func LargestPrimeFactor(n int) int {
    for i := 2; i <= n; i++ {
        if n%i == 0 {
            n /= i
            i--
        }
    }
    return n
}
```

This function takes an integer n as input and returns the largest prime factor of n. The function uses a for loop to iterate over all integers from 2 to n. If n is divisible by i, n is divided by i and i is decremented by 1. This ensures that we only check prime numbers. Once we find the largest prime number that divides n evenly, we return it as the largest prime factor of n.
