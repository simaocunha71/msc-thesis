This function returns the largest prime factor of a given number n. It uses a loop to divide n by each number starting from 2 until n is no longer divisible by that number. If n is divisible by that number, it updates the largest prime factor and sets n to the remainder of the division. If n is not divisible by that number, it increments the number and continues the loop. Once the loop is finished, the function returns the largest prime factor.

The function also checks if n is a prime number by dividing it by each number starting from 2 until the square root of n. If n is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not a prime number and the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns n.

Here is the corrected code:

```
func LargestPrimeFactor(n int) int {
    largestPrime := 0
    for i := 2; i <= n; i++ {
        for n%i == 0 {
            largestPrime = i
            n = n / i
        }
    }
    return largestPrime
}
```
