The formula for the area of a triangle is A = 1/2 * base * height. In this case, the base is the length of the side, and the height is the given height. So, the area of the triangle is 1/2 * a * h. Here is the complete code:

```go
func TriangleArea(a float64, h float64) float64 {
    return 0.5 * a * h
}
```

This code takes two float64 arguments, a and h, and returns the area of a triangle with a base of a and height of h.
