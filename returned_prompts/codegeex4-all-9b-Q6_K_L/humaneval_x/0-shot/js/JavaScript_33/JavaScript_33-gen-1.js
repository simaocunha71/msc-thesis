You can use the following JavaScript code to solve the problem:

```javascript
const sortThird = (l) => {
  // Create an array to store the values at indices that are divisible by three
  let valuesAtThree = [];
  
  // Iterate through the array and add the values at indices that are divisible by three to the valuesAtThree array
  for (let i = 0; i < l.length; i++) {
    if (i % 3 === 0) {
      valuesAtThree.push(l[i]);
    }
  }
  
  // Sort the valuesAtThree array
  valuesAtThree.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  
  // Iterate through the array again and replace the values at indices that are divisible by three with the sorted values
  for (let i = 0; i < l.length; i++) {
    if (i % 3 === 0) {
      l[i] = valuesAtThree.shift();
    }
  }
  
  // Return the modified array
  return l;
}
```

This code works by first creating an array to store the values at indices that are divisible by three. It then iterates through the array and adds the values at indices that are divisible by three to the valuesAtThree array. After that, it sorts the valuesAtThree array and replaces the values at indices that are divisible by three with the sorted values. Finally, it returns the modified array.
