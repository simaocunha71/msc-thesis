The provided JavaScript function, `sortThird`, takes an array `l` as input and returns a new array `l'` that has the same elements as `l` in all indices that are not divisible by three. However, the elements at indices that are divisible by three are sorted in ascending order. Here's a breakdown of how the function works:

1. **Filtering Indices for Sorting**: The function uses the `filter` method to select indices of `l` that are divisible by three (i.e., indices 3, 6, 9, etc.). The `filter` method creates a new array of indices that meet the condition `i % 3 === 0`.

2. **Sorting the Filtered Values**: The selected indices are then used to access the corresponding elements of `l` using the `map` method. These elements are placed into a new array `filteredValues`.

3. **Sorting the Values**: The `filteredValues` array is sorted in ascending order using the `sort` method.

4. **Reconstructing the Result Array**: The function then reconstructs the new array `l'` by iterating over the original array `l` with the `reduce` method. If the index `i` is divisible by three, the function appends the sorted value from `filteredValues` at the corresponding position. Otherwise, it appends the original value from `l`.

Here is the complete function with detailed comments:

```javascript
const sortThird = (l) => {
  // Filter indices that are divisible by three
  const indicesToSort = l.filter((_, i) => i % 3 === 0);
  
  // Map those indices to their corresponding values in l
  const filteredValues = indicesToSort.map(i => l[i]);
  
  // Sort the filtered values in ascending order
  const sortedValues = filteredValues.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  
  // Reconstruct the array by replacing values at indices divisible by three
  return l.reduce((acc, val, i) => {
    if (i % 3 === 0) {
      // Replace the value at the current index with the sorted value
      acc.push(sortedValues.shift());
    } else {
      // Keep the original value
      acc.push(val);
    }
    return acc;
  }, []);
};
```

This function correctly implements the described behavior and can be tested with the provided examples:

```javascript
console.log(sortThird([1,
