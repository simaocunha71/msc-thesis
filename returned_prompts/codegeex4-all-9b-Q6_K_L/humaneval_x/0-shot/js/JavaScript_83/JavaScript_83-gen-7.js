The problem requires us to find the count of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1. Here is a possible solution using JavaScript:

```javascript
const startsOneEnds = (n) => {
  if (n === 1) return 2; // base case: for n = 1, there are two numbers: 1 and 1
  let count = 9 * Math.pow(10, n - 2); // count of numbers not starting or ending with 1
  count += 2 * Math.pow(10, n - 1); // count of numbers starting or ending with 1
  return count;
}
```

Let's break down the solution:

1. If n is 1, the only two possible numbers are 1 and 1. So, we return 2.
2. For n greater than 1, we calculate the count of numbers that do not start or end with 1. This can be calculated as 9 * 10^(n-2), where 9 is the number of choices for the first digit (since it cannot be 0 or 1) and 10^(n-2) is the number of choices for the remaining digits.
3. To this count, we add the count of numbers that start or end with 1. This can be calculated as 2 * 10^(n-1), where 2 is the number of choices for the first digit (since it can be either 1 or 10) and 10^(n-1) is the number of choices for the remaining digits.
4. Finally, we return the total count.

This solution has a time complexity of O(1) since it performs a constant number of operations regardless of the value of n.
