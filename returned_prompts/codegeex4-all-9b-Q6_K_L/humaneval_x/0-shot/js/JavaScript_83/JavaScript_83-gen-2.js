The problem is asking to count the number of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1. 

Firstly, we need to understand that if a number starts or ends with 1, then the remaining digits can be anything from 0 to 9. Therefore, for each digit place after the first or last digit, there are 10 possibilities.

For an n-digit number:
- If the first digit is 1, then the remaining (n-1) digits can be anything from 0 to 9, which gives us 9^(n-1) possibilities.
- If the last digit is 1, then the first (n-1) digits can be anything from 0 to 9, which gives us 9^(n-1) possibilities.

Therefore, the total count would be 2 * 9^(n-1).

Here's the JavaScript implementation of this logic:

```javascript
const startsOneEnds = (n) => {
    return 2 * Math.pow(9, n - 1);
};
```

This function takes an integer n as input and returns the count of the numbers of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1.
