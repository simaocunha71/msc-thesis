To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number \( n \) can be expressed as the sum of exactly four positive even numbers. 

The sum of four even numbers can be represented as:
\[ 2a + 2b + 2c + 2d \]
where \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \) are positive integers. 

Simplifying the equation, we get:
\[ 4(a + b + c + d) \]
This shows that \( n \) must be a multiple of 4 for the equation to hold true.

Now, let's write the function `isEqualToSumEven` to check if \( n \) is a multiple of 4.
```javascript
const isEqualToSumEven = (n) => {
  // Check if n is a multiple of 4
  return n % 4 === 0;
}
```

Let's test the function with the provided examples:
```javascript
console.log(isEqualToSumEven(4)); // false
console.log(isEqualToSumEven(6)); // false
console.log(isEqualToSumEven(8)); // true
```

The function correctly evaluates whether the given number \( n \) can be written as the sum of exactly four positive even numbers.
