To determine if a given number \( n \) can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers, we need to consider the properties of even numbers. An even number is divisible by 2, and the smallest even number is 2. The sum of four even numbers would be \( 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8 \), which is the smallest sum that can be achieved with four even numbers. Therefore, if \( n \) is less than 8, it cannot be written as the sum of four even numbers.

For \( n \geq 8 \), we need to check if the difference between \( n \) and 8 is also even. If it is, then we can find a set of four even numbers that sum to \( n \). If the difference is odd, then \( n \) cannot be written as the sum of four even numbers.

Here is the corrected function:

```javascript
const isEqualToSumEven = (n) => {
  // If n is less than 8, it cannot be written as the sum of four even numbers
  if (n < 8) {
    return false;
  }
  // Calculate the difference between n and 8
  const difference = n - 8;
  // If the difference is even, n can be written as the sum of four even numbers
  return difference % 2 === 0;
};
```

Let's test the function with the provided examples:

```javascript
console.log(isEqualToSumEven(4)); // false
console.log(isEqualToSumEven(6)); // false
console.log(isEqualToSumEven(8)); // true
```

The function should return the expected results for these test cases.
