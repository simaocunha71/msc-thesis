To solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make an array palindromic, we can use a two-pointer approach. Here's how we can implement the `smallestChange` function:

```javascript
const smallestChange = (arr) => {
  let left = 0;
  let right = arr.length - 1;
  let changes = 0;

  while (left < right) {
    if (arr[left] !== arr[right]) {
      changes++;
    }
    left++;
    right--;
  }

  return changes;
};
```

In this function, we initialize two pointers: `left` and `right`, to the start and end of the array, respectively. We also initialize a variable `changes` to keep track of the number of changes needed.

We then enter a loop that continues until the `left` pointer is less than the `right` pointer. In each iteration, we compare the elements at the `left` and `right` pointers. If they are not equal, it means we need to change one of them to make the array palindromic, so we increment the `changes` variable.

After each comparison, we move the `left` pointer one step to the right and the `right` pointer one step to the left. This way, we gradually move towards the middle of the array.

Once the loop ends, we return the value of `changes`, which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array palindromic.

Here are some examples to demonstrate the usage of the `smallestChange` function:

```javascript
console.log(smallestChange([1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 9, 6])); // Output: 4
console.log(smallestChange([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2])); // Output: 1
console.log(smallestChange([1, 2, 3, 2, 1])); // Output: 0
```

The first example requires 4 changes to make the array palindromic, and the last example requires 0 changes because the array is already palindromic.
