The problem is asking to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers, a and b. The GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder.

There are several algorithms to find the GCD of two numbers, but one of the most common and efficient algorithms is the Euclidean algorithm.

The Euclidean algorithm works on the principle that the greatest common divisor of two numbers does not change if the larger number is replaced by its difference with the smaller number. For example, GCD(48, 18) is the same as GCD(18, 30), and GCD(18, 30) is the same as GCD(30, 12), and so on, until the two numbers become equal. When they are equal, that number is the GCD.

Here's a simple implementation of the Euclidean algorithm in JavaScript:

```javascript
const greatestCommonDivisor = (a, b) => {
  while (b !== 0) {
    let temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp % b;
  }
  return a;
}
```

This function takes two arguments, a and b, and repeatedly replaces a with b and b with the remainder of a divided by b until b is 0. At that point, a is the GCD of the original a and b.

For example, if you call `greatestCommonDivisor(3, 5)`, the function will return 1, because 1 is the greatest number that divides both 3 and 5 without leaving a remainder.

If you call `greatestCommonDivisor(25, 15)`, the function will return 5, because 5 is the greatest number that divides both 25 and 15 without leaving a remainder.
