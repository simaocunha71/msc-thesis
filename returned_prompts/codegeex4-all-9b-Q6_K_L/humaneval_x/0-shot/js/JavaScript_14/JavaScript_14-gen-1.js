The task is to generate all possible prefixes of a given string, starting from the shortest one to the longest. A prefix of a string is a substring that starts at the beginning of the original string. 

Here is one way to implement the `allPrefixes` function in JavaScript:

```javascript
const allPrefixes = (string) => {
  let prefixes = [];
  for (let i = 1; i <= string.length; i++) {
    prefixes.push(string.substring(0, i));
  }
  return prefixes;
};
```

This function works by iterating over the indices of the string from 1 to its length. For each index `i`, it uses the `substring` method to extract the substring from the start of the string to the `i`-th character and adds it to the `prefixes` array. The `substring` method is used here instead of `slice` because `substring` handles negative indices as starting from the end of the string, which is not desired in this case.
