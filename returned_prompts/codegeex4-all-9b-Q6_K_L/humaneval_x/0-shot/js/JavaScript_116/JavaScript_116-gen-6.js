To solve this problem, you need to count the number of ones in the binary representation of each number and then sort the array based on these counts. If two numbers have the same count of ones, they should be sorted based on their decimal value. Here's how you can implement the `sortArray` function in JavaScript:

```javascript
const sortArray = (arr) => {
  return arr.sort((a, b) => {
    // Count the number of ones in the binary representation of a and b
    const countA = a.toString(2).replace(/0/g, '').length;
    const countB = b.toString(2).replace(/0/g, '').length;

    // If the counts are different, sort based on the count
    if (countA !== countB) {
      return countA - countB;
    }

    // If the counts are the same, sort based on the decimal value
    return a - b;
  });
};

console.log(sortArray([1, 5, 2, 3, 4]));  // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
console.log(sortArray([-2, -3, -4, -5, -6]));  // [-6, -5, -4, -3, -2]
console.log(sortArray([1, 0, 2, 3, 4]));  // [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

Explanation:
1. The `sortArray` function takes an array of integers as input.
2. The array is sorted using the `sort` method.
3. The `sort` method takes a comparison function that compares two elements, `a` and `b`.
4. The comparison function counts the number of ones in the binary representation of `a` and `b` using the `toString(2)` method to convert the numbers to binary strings and then replacing all zeros with an empty string to count the number of ones.
5. If the counts are different, the function returns the difference between the counts, which sorts the numbers based on the count of ones.
6. If the counts are the same, the function returns the difference between the decimal values of `a` and `b`, which sorts the numbers based on their decimal value.
7. The sorted array is returned.
