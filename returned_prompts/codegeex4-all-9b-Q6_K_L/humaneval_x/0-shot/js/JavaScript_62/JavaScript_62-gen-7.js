```js
const derivative = (xs) => {
  // Check if xs is an array and has at least one element
  if (!Array.isArray(xs) || xs.length === 0) {
    throw new Error('Input must be a non-empty array');
  }

  // Calculate the derivative of the polynomial
  return xs.map((coefficient, index) => coefficient * index).slice(1);
};
```

The `derivative` function calculates the derivative of a polynomial represented by the array `xs`. The derivative of a polynomial `f(x) = a_n * x^n + a_{n-1} * x^{n-1} + ... + a_1 * x + a_0` is given by `f'(x) = n * a_n * x^{n-1} + (n-1) * a_{n-1} * x^{n-2} + ... + 1 * a_1 * x^0`.

The function first checks if `xs` is a non-empty array. If not, it throws an error. Then, it uses the `map` function to create a new array where each element is the product of the coefficient and its corresponding index (which represents the power of `x`). Finally, it slices the resulting array from the second element (index 1) onwards, as the first element (index 0) becomes 0 when taking the derivative of a polynomial.
