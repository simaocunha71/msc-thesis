The task requires summing the squares of the numbers in the given list, where each number first needs to be rounded to the nearest integer. This can be achieved using the `Math.ceil()` method to round each number up to the nearest whole number, and then squaring and summing the results.

Here is the complete solution:

```javascript
const sumSquares = (lst) => {
  // Initialize sum to 0
  let sum = 0;
  // Iterate over each element in the list
  for (let i = 0; i < lst.length; i++) {
    // Round each element to the nearest integer using Math.ceil()
    // Square the rounded number and add it to the sum
    sum += Math.ceil(lst[i]) ** 2;
  }
  // Return the final sum of squares
  return sum;
}
```

This function will correctly compute the sum of the squares of the ceiling-rounded numbers in the input list.
