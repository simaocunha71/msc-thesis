You can use the built-in `length` property of JavaScript strings to get the length of a string. Here is the modified function:

```javascript
const strlen = (string) => {
  return string.length;
}
```

The `length` property of a string returns the number of characters in a string. For example, `'abc'.length` will return `3`.
