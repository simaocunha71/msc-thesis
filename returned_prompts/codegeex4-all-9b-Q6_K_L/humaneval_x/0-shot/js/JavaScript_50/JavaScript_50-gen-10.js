The task is to create a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string where each character is shifted by 5 positions in the alphabet. The function should handle both uppercase and lowercase letters. 

Here is a possible solution:

```python
def encode_string(s):
    result = ""
    for char in s:
        if char.isalpha():
            if char.isupper():
                result += chr((ord(char) - 65 + 5) % 26 + 65)
            else:
                result += chr((ord(char) - 97 + 5) % 26 + 97)
        else:
            result += char
    return result
```

The function `encode_string` takes a string `s` as input. It initializes an empty string `result` to store the encoded string. 

Then, it iterates over each character `char` in the input string `s`. 

If the character is an alphabet letter, it checks if it is uppercase or lowercase. 

If it is uppercase, it calculates the new position of the character by subtracting 65 (the ASCII value of 'A'), adding 5, taking the modulus 26 to wrap around the alphabet, and adding 65 to get the ASCII value of the new character. 

If it is lowercase, it calculates the new position in a similar way, but subtracting 97 (the ASCII value of 'a') instead. 

If the character is not an alphabet letter, it adds it directly to the result string. 

Finally, it returns the encoded string `result`.
