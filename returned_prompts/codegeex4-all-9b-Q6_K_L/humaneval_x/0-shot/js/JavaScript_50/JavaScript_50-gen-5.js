The task is to create an algorithm that can encode and decode strings by shifting each character in the alphabet by a certain number of places. The encoding function `encodeShift` takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string where each character is shifted by 5 places in the alphabet. The decoding function `decodeShift` takes the encoded string as input and returns the original string by shifting each character back by 5 places in the alphabet.

Here is the complete code:

```javascript
/*
  returns encoded string by shifting every character by 5 in the alphabet.
  */
const encodeShift = (s) => {
  return s.split("").map(ch => String.fromCharCode(
    ((ch.charCodeAt(0) + 5 - "a".charCodeAt(0)) % 26) + "a".charCodeAt(0)
  )).join("");
}

/*
  takes as input string encoded with encode_shift function. Returns decoded string.
  */
const decodeShift = (s) => {
  return s.split("").map(ch => String.fromCharCode(
    ((ch.charCodeAt(0) - 5 + 26 - "a".charCodeAt(0)) % 26) + "a".charCodeAt(0)
  )).join("");
}
```

The `encodeShift` function works by taking each character in the input string `s`, converting it to its ASCII code using `charCodeAt(0)`, adding 5 to the ASCII code, and then converting it back to a character using `String.fromCharCode`. The result is then joined together into a new string.

The `decodeShift` function works similarly, but instead of adding 5 to the ASCII code, it subtracts 5. This effectively reverses the encoding process and returns the original string.
