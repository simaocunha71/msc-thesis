The problem can be solved using Depth-First Search (DFS) and Priority Queue (Min Heap). 

The idea is to start from each cell and perform a DFS to find the shortest path of length k. 

We use a priority queue to keep track of the paths we have found. Each path is represented as a list of cells and its length. 

When we explore a cell, we have two options: 
1. Move to a neighboring cell and continue the path. 
2. Stop the path and add it to the priority queue.

We repeat this process until the priority queue is empty or we have found a path of length k. 

The output is the path with the smallest lexicographical order.

Here is the Python code for the problem:

```python
import heapq

def minPath(grid, k):
    n = len(grid)
    directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
    pq = []
    visited = set()

    def dfs(i, j, path):
        if len(path) == k:
            heapq.heappush(pq, (path[:], i, j))
            return
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = i + dx, j + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and (nx, ny) not in visited:
                visited.add((nx, ny))
                dfs(nx, ny, path + [grid[nx][ny]])
                visited.remove((nx, ny))

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            visited.add((i, j))
            dfs(i, j, [grid[i][j]])
            visited.remove((i, j))

    while pq:
        path, i, j = heapq.heappop(pq)
        if len(path) == k:
            return path
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = i + dx, j + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and (nx, ny) not in visited:
                visited.add((nx, ny))
                dfs(nx, ny, path + [grid[nx][ny]])
                visited.remove((nx, ny))

    return []
```

We start by initializing the priority queue, the set of visited cells, and the directions we can move in the grid. 

Then we define a recursive function dfs that performs a Depth-
