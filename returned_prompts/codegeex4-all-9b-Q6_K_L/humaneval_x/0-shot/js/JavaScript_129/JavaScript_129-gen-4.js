To solve this problem, you can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. The idea is to start from each cell in the grid and explore all possible paths of length k. For each cell, you can move to its adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) and add the value of the cell to the current path. Keep track of the minimum path found so far.

Here is the step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize a queue and enqueue all cells in the grid.
2. While the queue is not empty:
   - Dequeue a cell from the queue.
   - If the current path length is equal to k, return the path.
   - Otherwise, explore all adjacent cells:
     - If the adjacent cell is within the grid and not visited before, enqueue it to the queue and add its value to the current path.
     - Backtrack by removing the last cell from the current path.
3. If no path of length k is found, return an empty list.

Here is the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
const minPath = (grid, k) => {
  const n = grid.length;
  const directions = [[-1, 0], [1, 0], [0, -1], [0, 1]];
  const queue = [];
  let result = [];

  // Helper function to enqueue a cell
  const enqueue = (cell, path) => {
    queue.push({ cell, path });
  };

  // Helper function to dequeue a cell
  const dequeue = () => {
    return queue.shift();
  };

  // Helper function to check if a cell is within the grid
  const isValid = (row, col) => {
    return row >= 0 && row < n && col >= 0 && col < n;
  };

  // Initialize the queue with all cells
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      enqueue([i, j], [grid[i][j]]);
    }
  }

  // BFS
  while (queue.length > 0) {
    const { cell, path } = dequeue();
    const [row, col] = cell;

    // If the current path length is equal to k, return the path
    if (path.length === k) {
      result = path;
      break;
    }

    // Explore all adjacent cells
    for (const [
