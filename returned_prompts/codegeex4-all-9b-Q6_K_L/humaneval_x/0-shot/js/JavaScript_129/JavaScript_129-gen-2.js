To solve this problem, we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. We start from each cell in the grid and explore all possible paths of length k. We keep track of the minimum path found so far.

Here is the step-by-step algorithm:

1. Initialize a queue and enqueue all cells in the grid.
2. While the queue is not empty, do the following:
   a. Dequeue a cell from the queue.
   b. If the length of the current path is equal to k, add the values on the cells of the current path to the result list and return it.
   c. Otherwise, for each neighbor cell of the current cell, enqueue the neighbor cell and the current path with the neighbor cell added.
3. If the queue becomes empty without finding a path of length k, return an empty list.

Here is the implementation of the above algorithm in JavaScript:

```javascript
const minPath = (grid, k) => {
  const n = grid.length;
  const directions = [[1, 0], [-1, 0], [0, 1], [0, -1]];
  const queue = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      queue.push([[grid[i][j]], i, j]);
    }
  }

  while (queue.length > 0) {
    const [path, x, y] = queue.shift();
    if (path.length === k) {
      return path;
    }
    for (const [dx, dy] of directions) {
      const newX = x + dx;
      const newY = y + dy;
      if (newX >= 0 && newX < n && newY >= 0 && newY < n) {
        queue.push([path.concat(grid[newX][newY]), newX, newY]);
      }
    }
  }

  return [];
};
```

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(N^2 * k) and a space complexity of O(N^2 * k), where N is the size of the grid.
