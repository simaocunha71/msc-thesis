To solve this problem, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. We will start from each cell in the grid and explore all possible paths of length k. We will keep track of the minimum path found so far and return it as the result.

Here is the step-by-step algorithm:

1. Initialize a queue and a set. The queue will store the cells to be explored and the set will store the cells that have already been visited.
2. For each cell in the grid, add it to the queue and the set.
3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:
   a. Dequeue a cell from the queue.
   b. If the number of cells visited so far is equal to k, return the current path.
   c. For each neighbor of the current cell that has not been visited yet, add it to the queue and the set.
4. If no path of length k is found, return an empty list.

Here is the implementation of the algorithm in JavaScript:

```javascript
const minPath = (grid, k) => {
  const n = grid.length;
  const queue = [];
  const visited = new Set();

  // Initialize the queue and the set
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      queue.push([i, j]);
      visited.add(`${i},${j}`);
    }
  }

  // BFS
  while (queue.length > 0) {
    const [x, y] = queue.shift();

    // If the number of cells visited so far is equal to k, return the current path
    if (visited.size === k) {
      return grid[x][y];
    }

    // Explore the neighbors of the current cell
    const neighbors = [[x - 1, y], [x + 1, y], [x, y - 1], [x, y + 1]];
    for (const [nx, ny] of neighbors) {
      if (nx >= 0 && nx < n && ny >= 0 && ny < n && !visited.has(`${nx},${ny}`)) {
        queue.push([nx, ny]);
        visited.add(`${nx},${ny}`);
      }
    }
  }

  // If no path of length k is found, return an empty list
  return [];
};
```

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(N^2) and
