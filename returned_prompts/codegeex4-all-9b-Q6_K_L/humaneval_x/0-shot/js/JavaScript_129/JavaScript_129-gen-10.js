To solve the problem of finding the minimum path of length `k` in a grid, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. The BFS will help us explore all possible paths of length `k` and find the lexicographically smallest path. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the approach:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - Create a priority queue (or min-heap) to store paths along with their lengths. The paths will be stored as arrays of cell values.
   - Initialize a queue to perform the BFS. Each element in the queue will be a tuple containing the current path, the current cell coordinates, and the current length of the path.
   - Create a set to keep track of visited cells to avoid revisiting them.

2. **BFS Execution**:
   - Dequeue an element (current path, current cell, current length).
   - If the current length equals `k`, add the current path to the priority queue.
   - For each valid neighboring cell:
     - If the neighboring cell has not been visited, mark it as visited.
     - Enqueue the new path formed by appending the value of the neighboring cell to the current path.

3. **Extract the Result**:
   - Once the BFS is complete, the priority queue will contain the lexicographically smallest path of length `k`.
   - Extract the path from the priority queue and return it.

Here is the complete code:

```javascript
const PriorityQueue = require('@datastructures-js/priority-queue');

const minPath = (grid, k) => {
  const n = grid.length;
  const queue = [];
  const visited = new Set();
  const directions = [[0, 1], [0, -1], [1, 0], [-1, 0]];

  // Helper function to check if a cell is within the grid boundaries
  const isValid = (x, y) => x >= 0 && x < n && y >= 0 && y < n;

  // Initialize the BFS queue with all cells and their initial values
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      queue.push([[grid[i][j]], i, j, 1]);
      visited.add(`${i},${j}`);
    }
  }

  const pq = new PriorityQueue({ compare: (a, b) => a[0].localeCompare(b[0]) });
