The code you provided has an error. The `Math.abs` function is used to calculate the absolute difference between two numbers. However, it is not used correctly in the code. The `Math.abs` function should be used to calculate the absolute difference between two numbers, not between the current number and the smallest number found so far. Additionally, the `Math.abs` function is used to calculate the absolute difference between two numbers, not between the current number and the smallest number found so far.

Here is the corrected code:

```javascript
const findClosestElements = (numbers) => {
  if (numbers.length < 2) {
    throw new Error('Input must have at least two numbers');
  }

  let closestPair = [numbers[0], numbers[1]];
  let smallestDifference = Math.abs(numbers[0] - numbers[1]);

  for (let i = 2; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
      const difference = Math.abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]);
      if (difference < smallestDifference) {
        smallestDifference = difference;
        closestPair = [numbers[j], numbers[i]];
      }
    }
  }

  return closestPair;
};
```

The corrected code works as follows:

1. It checks if the input array has at least two numbers. If not, it throws an error.
2. It initializes the `closestPair` variable with the first two numbers in the array and the `smallestDifference` variable with the absolute difference between the first two numbers.
3. It iterates over the remaining numbers in the array.
4. For each number, it iterates over the previous numbers in the array.
5. It calculates the absolute difference between the current number and each previous number.
6. If the absolute difference is smaller than the smallest difference found so far, it updates the `smallestDifference` and `closestPair` variables.
7. Finally, it returns the `closestPair` variable, which contains the two numbers that are closest to each other.
