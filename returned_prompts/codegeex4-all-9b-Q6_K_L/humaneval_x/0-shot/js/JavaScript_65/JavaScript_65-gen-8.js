To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Convert the integer `x` to a string `xStr`.
2. If `shift` is greater than the length of `xStr`, reverse `xStr`.
3. Otherwise, slice `xStr` at the index `shift` and concatenate it with the remaining part.
4. Return the result.

Here's the updated code:

```javascript
const circularShift = (x, shift) => {
  let xStr = x.toString();
  if (shift > xStr.length) {
    return xStr.split('').reverse().join('');
  } else {
    return xStr.slice(shift) + xStr.slice(0, shift);
  }
};

// Example usage:
console.log(circularShift(12, 1)); // Output: "21"
console.log(circularShift(12, 2)); // Output: "12"
```

This solution first converts the integer `x` to a string `xStr`. Then, it checks if `shift` is greater than the length of `xStr`. If it is, the digits are reversed by splitting `xStr` into an array of characters, reversing the array, and joining it back into a string. Otherwise, the digits are shifted by slicing `xStr` at the index `shift` and concatenating it with the remaining part. Finally, the result is returned.
