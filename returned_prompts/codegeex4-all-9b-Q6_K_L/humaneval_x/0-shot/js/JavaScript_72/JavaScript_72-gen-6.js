To determine if the object q will fly, we need to check two conditions:
1. The object q should be a palindrome, meaning it reads the same forwards and backwards.
2. The sum of its elements should be less than or equal to the maximum possible weight w.

Here's the step-by-step approach to solve this problem:
1. Check if the object q is a palindrome by comparing it with its reversed version.
2. If it is a palindrome, calculate the sum of its elements.
3. If the sum is less than or equal to w, return true; otherwise, return false.

Here is the updated function:

```javascript
const willItFly = (q, w) => {
  // Check if q is a palindrome
  if (JSON.stringify(q) !== JSON.stringify(q.reverse())) {
    return false;
  }
  
  // Calculate the sum of elements in q
  const sum = q.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);
  
  // Check if the sum is less than or equal to w
  return sum <= w;
}
```

Let's test the function with the given examples:

```javascript
console.log(willItFly([1, 2], 5)); // false
console.log(willItFly([3, 2, 3], 1)); // false
console.log(willItFly([3, 2, 3], 9)); // true
console.log(willItFly([3], 5)); // true
```

The function will return the expected results for the given examples.
