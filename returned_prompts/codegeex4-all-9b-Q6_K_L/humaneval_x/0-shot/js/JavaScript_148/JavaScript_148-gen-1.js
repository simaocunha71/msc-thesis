The problem is asking to create a function that takes two planet names as strings, and then returns a tuple of all the planets that are in between the two planets in the solar system, sorted by their proximity to the sun. If either of the planets is not a valid planet name, the function should return an empty tuple.

Here is a possible solution in Python:

```python
def bf(planet1, planet2):
    planets = ["Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus", "Neptune"]
    
    # Check if the planets are in the list
    if planet1 not in planets or planet2 not in planets:
        return ()
    
    # Find the indices of the planets in the list
    index1 = planets.index(planet1)
    index2 = planets.index(planet2)
    
    # If planet1 is after planet2 in the list, swap their indices
    if index1 > index2:
        index1, index2 = index2, index1
    
    # Return a tuple of all the planets in between the two planets
    return tuple(planets[index1+1:index2])
```

And here is the solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
const bf = (planet1, planet2) => {
    const planets = ["Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus", "Neptune"];
    
    // Check if the planets are in the list
    if (!planets.includes(planet1) || !planets.includes(planet2)) {
        return [];
    }
    
    // Find the indices of the planets in the list
    const index1 = planets.indexOf(planet1);
    const index2 = planets.indexOf(planet2);
    
    // If planet1 is after planet2 in the list, swap their indices
    if (index1 > index2) {
        [index1, index2] = [index2, index1];
    }
    
    // Return an array of all the planets in between the two planets
    return planets.slice(index1 + 1, index2);
}
```

Both of these solutions first create a list of all the planets in the solar system. Then, it checks if both planets are in the list. If not, it returns an empty tuple or array. If they are in the list, it finds the indices of the
