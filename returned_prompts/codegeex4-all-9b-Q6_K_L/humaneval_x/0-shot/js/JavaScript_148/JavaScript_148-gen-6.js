To solve this problem, we can start by defining an array of planet names in the order of their distance from the Sun. Then, we can find the indices of the given planets in this array. If either of the planets is not found in the array, we can return an empty tuple.

Next, we can determine the range of indices between the two planets, taking into account the order of the planets. If planet1 is located before planet2, we can keep the indices as they are. Otherwise, we need to reverse the order of the indices.

Finally, we can use the range of indices to extract the corresponding planets from the array and return them as a tuple. Here's the implementation of the bf function:

```javascript
const bf = (planet1, planet2) => {
  const planets = ["Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus", "Neptune"];
  const index1 = planets.indexOf(planet1);
  const index2 = planets.indexOf(planet2);

  if (index1 === -1 || index2 === -1) {
    return [];
  }

  let start = Math.min(index1, index2);
  let end = Math.max(index1, index2);

  return planets.slice(start + 1, end).map((planet) => [planet]);
};

console.log(bf("Jupiter", "Neptune")); // Output: ["Saturn", "Uranus"]
console.log(bf("Earth", "Mercury")); // Output: ["Venus"]
console.log(bf("Mercury", "Uranus")); // Output: ["Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn"]
```
