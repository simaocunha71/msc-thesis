The `stringSequence` function can be implemented by creating a loop that iterates from 0 to `n` and concatenates each number to a string with a space in between. Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
const stringSequence = (n) => {
  let result = '';
  for (let i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
    result += i + ' ';
  }
  // Remove the trailing space
  return result.trim();
};
```

This function initializes an empty string `result` and then uses a `for` loop to iterate from `0` to `n`, adding each number followed by a space to the `result` string. After the loop, the `trim()` method is called on the `result` string to remove the trailing space before returning the final string.
