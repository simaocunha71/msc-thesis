You can solve this problem by using a frequency map to count the occurrences of each number, then iterating through the map to find the number with the maximum frequency that is greater than or equal to the value of the number itself. Here is the solution:

```javascript
const search = (lst) => {
  let frequencyMap = {};
  let maxFrequency = -1;
  let result = -1;

  // Count the frequency of each number
  for (let num of lst) {
    frequencyMap[num] = (frequencyMap[num] || 0) + 1;
    maxFrequency = Math.max(maxFrequency, frequencyMap[num]);
  }

  // Find the number with the maximum frequency that is greater than or equal to the value of the number itself
  for (let num in frequencyMap) {
    if (frequencyMap[num] >= num && frequencyMap[num] > maxFrequency) {
      result = num;
      maxFrequency = frequencyMap[num];
    }
  }

  return result;
}
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list.
