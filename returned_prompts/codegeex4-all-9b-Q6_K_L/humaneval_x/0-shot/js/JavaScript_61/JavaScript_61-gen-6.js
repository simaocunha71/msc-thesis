The provided solution is an iterative approach that uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. Initialize an empty stack to store the opening brackets.
2. Iterate through each character in the input string `brackets`.
3. If the character is an opening bracket, push it onto the stack.
4. If the character is a closing bracket, check if the stack is empty. If it is, return `false` because there is no corresponding opening bracket. If the top of the stack is the matching opening bracket, pop it from the stack. Otherwise, return `false`.
5. After iterating through all the characters, check if the stack is empty. If it is, return `true` because all opening brackets have been matched with closing brackets. If the stack is not empty, return `false`.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because each character in the string is processed exactly once.

The space complexity of this solution is O(n) in the worst case, where n is the length of the input string. This is because the stack can potentially store all the opening brackets in the case where the input string is a single opening bracket followed by n-1 closing brackets.

Here is the corrected code:

```javascript
const correctBracketing = (brackets) => {
  const stack = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < brackets.length; i++) {
    const char = brackets[i];
    if (char === "(") {
      stack.push(char);
    } else if (char === ")") {
      if (stack.length === 0) {
        return false;
      } else if (stack[stack.length - 1] === "(") {
        stack.pop();
      } else {
        return false;
      }
    }
  }
  return stack.length === 0;
};
```

Let's test the code with the provided examples:

```javascript
console.log(correctBracketing("("));  // false
console.log(correctBracketing("()"));  // true
console.log(correctBracketing("(()())"));  // true
console.log(correctBracketing(")(()"));  // false
```

The output should be:

```
false
true
true
false
```
