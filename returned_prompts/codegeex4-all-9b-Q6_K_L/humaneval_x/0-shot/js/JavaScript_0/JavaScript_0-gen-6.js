You can use a double loop to compare each pair of numbers and check if their difference is less than the threshold. If you find a pair of numbers that satisfy this condition, you can return true immediately. If you finish checking all pairs without finding any pair that satisfies the condition, you can return false.

Here's the implementation:

```javascript
const hasCloseElements = (numbers, threshold) => {
  for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    for (let j = i + 1; j < numbers.length; j++) {
      if (Math.abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold) {
        return true;
      }
    }
  }
  return false;
};
```

This function checks every pair of numbers in the input array. If it finds a pair whose absolute difference is less than the threshold, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.
