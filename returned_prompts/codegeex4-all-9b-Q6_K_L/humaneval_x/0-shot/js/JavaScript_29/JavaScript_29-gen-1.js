The function `filterByPrefix` takes two arguments: `strings`, which is an array of strings, and `prefix`, which is a string. The function iterates over each string in the `strings` array and checks if it starts with the given `prefix`. If it does, the string is added to a new array. This new array is then returned as the result.

Here is the implementation of the `filterByPrefix` function in JavaScript:

```javascript
const filterByPrefix = (strings, prefix) => {
  let result = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < strings.length; i++) {
    if (strings[i].startsWith(prefix)) {
      result.push(strings[i]);
    }
  }
  return result;
}
```

The `startsWith` method is used to check if a string starts with a given prefix. It returns `true` if the string starts with the prefix, and `false` otherwise. The `push` method is used to add the string to the `result` array.

Note that the `startsWith` method is case-sensitive. If you want to perform a case-insensitive comparison, you can convert both the string and the prefix to lowercase or uppercase before checking if they start with each other.
