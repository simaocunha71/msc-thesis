The question is asking us to create a function that takes a string representing a number and returns the closest integer to it. If the number is equidistant from two integers, we should round it away from zero. 

Here's one possible solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
const closestInteger = (value) => {
  // Convert the string to a number
  const num = parseFloat(value);
  
  // Round the number to the nearest integer
  const rounded = Math.round(num);
  
  // If the number is equidistant from two integers, round it away from zero
  if (num - rounded === 0.5) {
    return rounded + (num > 0 ? 1 : -1);
  }
  
  return rounded;
}
```

This solution first converts the input string to a number using the `parseFloat` function. Then it rounds the number to the nearest integer using the `Math.round` function. If the number is equidistant from two integers, the solution checks if the difference between the number and the rounded number is 0.5. If it is, the solution adds 1 to the rounded number if the number is positive, and subtracts 1 if it is negative. Finally, the solution returns the closest integer.
