The question asks for the largest index of an element which is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. 

To solve this problem, we can iterate through the array from the end to the beginning. If we find an element which is greater than the element immediately following it, we return the current index. If we finish the loop without finding any such element, we return -1.

Here is the solution:

```javascript
const canArrange = (arr) => {
  for (let i = arr.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
    if (arr[i] < arr[i - 1]) {
      return i - 1;
    }
  }
  return -1;
}
```

In this solution, we start iterating from the end of the array (`i = arr.length - 1`) and go backwards (`i--`). If we find an element (`arr[i]`) which is less than the element immediately following it (`arr[i - 1]`), we return the index of the element immediately following it (`i - 1`). If we finish the loop without finding any such element, we return -1.
