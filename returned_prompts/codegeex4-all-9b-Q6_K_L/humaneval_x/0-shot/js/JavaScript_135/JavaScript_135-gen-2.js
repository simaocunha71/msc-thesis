The problem is asking for the largest index of an element which is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. If no such element exists then return -1. This means that we are looking for the last element in the array that is smaller than the element before it.

Here is the solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
const canArrange = (arr) => {
  for(let i = arr.length - 1; i > 0; i--){
    if(arr[i] < arr[i - 1]){
      return i;
    }
  }
  return -1;
}
```

This function iterates over the array from the end to the beginning, and returns the index of the first element that is smaller than the element before it. If no such element exists, it returns -1. This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array.
