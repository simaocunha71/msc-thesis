The problem requires us to find the largest index `i` of an element in the array such that `arr[i]` is not greater than or equal to `arr[i-1]`. If no such element exists, we should return `-1`.

Here is a possible solution in JavaScript:

```js
const canArrange = (arr) => {
  let maxIndex = -1;
  for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] < arr[i - 1]) {
      maxIndex = i;
    }
  }
  return maxIndex;
}
```

This function iterates over the array starting from the second element (index 1). For each element, it checks if it is smaller than the previous element. If it is, it updates the `maxIndex` to the current index. At the end of the loop, it returns the `maxIndex`.

If no element is found that is smaller than its predecessor, the function will return `-1` as required.
