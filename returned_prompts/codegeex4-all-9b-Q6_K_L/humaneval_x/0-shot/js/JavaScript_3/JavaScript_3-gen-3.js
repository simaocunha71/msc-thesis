The problem is asking to check if at any point, the balance of the account falls below zero. We can solve this problem by iterating over the operations array and keeping track of the balance.

Here is the solution using JavaScript:

```javascript
const belowZero = (operations) => {
  let balance = 0;
  for(let i = 0; i < operations.length; i++) {
    balance += operations[i];
    if(balance < 0) {
      return true;
    }
  }
  return false;
}
```

In this code, we initialize the balance to zero and then iterate over the operations array. For each operation, we add it to the balance. If at any point the balance is less than zero, we return true. If we finish iterating over the array without the balance going below zero, we return false.
