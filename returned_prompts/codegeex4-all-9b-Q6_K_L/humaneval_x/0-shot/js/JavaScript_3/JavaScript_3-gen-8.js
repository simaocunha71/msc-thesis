The belowZero function is a JavaScript function that takes an array of deposit and withdrawal operations as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the balance of the account falls below zero at any point.

Here is the implementation of the belowZero function:

```javascript
const belowZero = (operations) => {
  let balance = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < operations.length; i++) {
    balance += operations[i];
    if (balance < 0) {
      return true;
    }
  }
  return false;
}
```

Explanation:
1. The function starts by initializing a variable balance to 0, which represents the current balance of the account.
2. It then iterates through each operation in the operations array using a for loop.
3. For each operation, it adds the value of the operation to the balance.
4. If the balance becomes negative at any point during the iteration, the function immediately returns true.
5. If the loop completes without the balance becoming negative, the function returns false.

The function can be used as follows:

```javascript
console.log(belowZero([1, 2, 3])); // Output: false
console.log(belowZero([1, 2, -4, 5])); // Output: true
```

In the first example, the balance never falls below zero, so the function returns false. In the second example, the balance falls below zero after the third operation, so the function returns true.
