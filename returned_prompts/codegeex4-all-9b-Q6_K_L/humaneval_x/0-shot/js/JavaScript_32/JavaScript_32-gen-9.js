The function `poly` calculates the value of a polynomial at a given point `x`. It takes in two arguments: `xs`, which is an array of coefficients for the polynomial, and `x`, which is the point at which to evaluate the polynomial.

The function uses the `reduce` method to iterate over the array `xs` and calculate the value of the polynomial at `x`. It does this by multiplying each coefficient `item` in `xs` by `x` raised to the power of its index `index`, and then adding this value to the previous value `prev`.

The `findZero` function is intended to find a zero of a polynomial. It takes in an array `xs` of coefficients for the polynomial. The function first checks that `xs` has an even number of coefficients and that the largest non-zero coefficient is in the first half of the array. If these conditions are not met, the function throws an error.

If the conditions are met, the function sets up an array `ys` of length `2n` where `n` is half the length of `xs`. It then sets the first `n` elements of `ys` to the first `n` elements of `xs` and the last `n` elements of `ys` to the negative of the last `n` elements of `xs`.

The function then iterates over the elements of `ys` and calculates the value of `poly` at `x` for each element. If the value of `poly` at `x` is less than or equal to `0.00001`, the function returns `x`.

If the function has not returned after iterating over all the elements of `ys`, it throws an error.
