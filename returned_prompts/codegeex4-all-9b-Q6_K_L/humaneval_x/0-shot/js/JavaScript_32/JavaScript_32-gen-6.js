To solve the problem, you can use the Newton-Raphson method, which is an iterative method for finding roots of a real-valued function.

The Newton-Raphson method starts with an initial guess for the root and then iteratively refines this guess until it reaches a desired level of accuracy. At each iteration, the method uses the derivative of the function to estimate the next guess.

Here's the implementation of the `findZero` function using the Newton-Raphson method:

```javascript
const findZero = (xs, maxIterations = 100, tolerance = 1e-6) => {
  let x = 0; // initial guess
  for (let i = 0; i < maxIterations; i++) {
    const f = poly(xs, x);
    const df = poly(xs.slice(1), x); // derivative of the polynomial
    const xNew = x - f / df;
    if (Math.abs(xNew - x) < tolerance) {
      return xNew;
    }
    x = xNew;
  }
  throw new Error('Failed to find a zero within the given tolerance');
}
```

The `findZero` function takes three parameters:

- `xs`: an array of coefficients of the polynomial.
- `maxIterations`: the maximum number of iterations to perform (default: 100).
- `tolerance`: the desired level of accuracy (default: 1e-6).

The function starts with an initial guess for the root, which is set to 0. Then, it iterates up to `maxIterations` times, refining the guess at each iteration.

At each iteration, the function calculates the value of the polynomial `f` and its derivative `df` at the current guess `x`. It then updates the guess to `x - f / df`, which is the next guess according to the Newton-Raphson method.

If the absolute difference between the current guess and the new guess is smaller than the `tolerance`, the function returns the current guess as the solution. Otherwise, it updates the guess and continues the iteration.

If the function reaches the maximum number of iterations without finding a solution within the desired tolerance, it throws an error.

Here's an example usage of the `findZero` function:

```javascript
console.log(findZero([1, 2])); // f(x) = 1 + 2x
console.log(findZero([-6, 11, -6, 1])); // (x
