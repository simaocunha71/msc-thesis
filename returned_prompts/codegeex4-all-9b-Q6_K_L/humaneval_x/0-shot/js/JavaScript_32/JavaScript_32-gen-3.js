Explanation:
The `findZero` function is based on the Newton-Raphson method, which is a root-finding algorithm. The algorithm starts with an initial guess for the root and then iteratively improves the guess until it converges to a root.

In this case, the `findZero` function takes a list of coefficients `xs` and finds the root of the polynomial defined by those coefficients. The function uses the Newton-Raphson method to find the root of the polynomial.

The `poly` function is used to evaluate the polynomial at a given point `x`. It takes a list of coefficients `xs` and a point `x` and returns the value of the polynomial at that point.

The `findZero` function starts by initializing the coefficients `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` based on the input list `xs`. It then uses the Newton-Raphson method to find the root of the polynomial.

The function first calculates the initial guess `x` for the root. It then evaluates the polynomial at that point `fx`. If `fx` is zero, then `x` is the root of the polynomial and the function returns `x`.

If `fx` is not zero, then the function calculates two new guesses for the root using the Newton-Raphson method. It then evaluates the polynomial at these two new guesses `x
