You can use a regular expression to count the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13. Here's an example implementation:

```javascript
const fizzBuzz = (n) => {
  let count = 0;
  for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    if (i % 11 === 0 || i % 13 === 0) {
      count += (i.toString().match(/7/g) || []).length;
    }
  }
  return count;
};
```

In this implementation, we iterate from 1 to n-1 and check if each number is divisible by 11 or 13. If it is, we convert the number to a string and use the `match` method with a regular expression to find all occurrences of the digit 7. We then add the length of the resulting array to our count.

This implementation assumes that the input n is a positive integer. If you need to handle other types of input or add additional validation, you may need to modify the implementation accordingly.
