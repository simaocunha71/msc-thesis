The problem requires us to count the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than a given number `n` that are divisible by either 11 or 13.

To solve this problem, we can iterate through all numbers from 1 to `n-1` that are divisible by either 11 or 13, and for each such number, count the occurrences of the digit 7.

Here's the solution:

```javascript
const fizzBuzz = (n) => {
  let count = 0;
  for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    if (i % 11 === 0 || i % 13 === 0) {
      let str = i.toString();
      for (let j = 0; j < str.length; j++) {
        if (str[j] === '7') {
          count++;
        }
      }
    }
  }
  return count;
}
```

Explanation:
1. Initialize a count variable to keep track of the number of times the digit 7 appears.
2. Iterate through all numbers from 1 to `n-1`.
3. Check if the current number is divisible by either 11 or 13 using the modulo operator `%`.
4. If the number is divisible, convert it to a string and iterate through each digit.
5. If the digit is 7, increment the count variable.
6. After the loop, return the count variable.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n*m), where n is the input number and m is the average number of digits in the numbers divisible by 11 or 13.
