The function `carRaceCollision` is designed to calculate the number of collisions between cars moving in opposite directions on an infinitely long straight road. Given `n` cars, each moving at the same speed, the function returns the total number of collisions that will occur.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the function works:

1. **Parameter**: The function takes a single parameter `n`, which represents the number of cars in each direction (left-to-right and right-to-left).

2. **Collision Count**: Since each car in one direction will collide with each car in the opposite direction, the total number of collisions is simply the square of `n`. This is because each car in the left-to-right direction will encounter `n` cars in the right-to-left direction, and each car in the right-to-left direction will encounter `n` cars in the left-to-right direction.

3. **Return**: The function returns the result of `n * n`, which is the total number of collisions.

Here is the complete function:

```javascript
const carRaceCollision = (n) => {
  // Calculate the total number of collisions
  const totalCollisions = n * n;
  
  // Return the total number of collisions
  return totalCollisions;
}
```

This function is straightforward and efficient, as it directly computes the total number of collisions using a simple mathematical operation. It assumes that all cars are moving at the same speed and that the road is infinitely long, which simplifies the problem to a straightforward calculation of combinations.
