To solve this problem, we need to determine the intersection of the two intervals and then check if the length of that intersection is a prime number. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Calculate the start and end of the intersection of the two intervals:
   - Start of intersection: maximum of the start values of the two intervals
   - End of intersection: minimum of the end values of the two intervals

2. Check if the start of the intersection is less than or equal to the end of the intersection. If not, the intervals don't intersect, and we return "NO".

3. Calculate the length of the intersection:
   - Length of intersection: end of intersection - start of intersection + 1

4. Check if the length of the intersection is a prime number:
   - If the length is less than 2, it's not a prime number.
   - If the length is 2, it's a prime number.
   - For other lengths, check if the length is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of the length. If it is, it's not a prime number.

5. Return "YES" if the length of the intersection is a prime number, otherwise return "NO".

Here's the updated code:

```javascript
const intersection = (interval1, interval2) => {
  // Calculate the start and end of the intersection
  const start = Math.max(interval1[0], interval2[0]);
  const end = Math.min(interval1[1], interval2[1]);

  // Check if the intervals intersect
  if (start > end) {
    return "NO";
  }

  // Calculate the length of the intersection
  const length = end - start + 1;

  // Check if the length is a prime number
  if (length < 2) {
    return "NO";
  } else if (length === 2) {
    return "YES";
  } else {
    for (let i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(length); i++) {
      if (length % i === 0) {
        return "NO";
      }
    }
    return "YES";
  }
};
```

This code should now correctly determine whether the length of the intersection of the two intervals is a prime number.
