To solve this problem, we need to calculate the mean (average) of the given list of numbers, then compute the absolute difference between each number and the mean, and finally find the average of these differences. Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
const meanAbsoluteDeviation = (numbers) => {
  // Calculate the mean of the numbers
  const mean = numbers.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0) / numbers.length;

  // Calculate the absolute differences between each number and the mean
  const absoluteDifferences = numbers.map(num => Math.abs(num - mean));

  // Calculate the average of these absolute differences
  const mad = absoluteDifferences.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0) / absoluteDifferences.length;

  return mad;
};
```

Now, let's test the function with the provided example:

```javascript
console.log(meanAbsoluteDeviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])); // Should return 1.0
```

This function should return the correct Mean Absolute Deviation for the given list of numbers.
