The question is asking you to find the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of a given list of numbers. MAD is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values. It is the average of the absolute differences between each number and the mean of the set.

Here is a solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
const meanAbsoluteDeviation = (numbers) => {
  // Calculate the mean of the numbers
  const mean = numbers.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0) / numbers.length;

  // Calculate the absolute differences between each number and the mean
  const differences = numbers.map(num => Math.abs(num - mean));

  // Calculate the mean of these absolute differences
  const mad = differences.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0) / differences.length;

  return mad;
}
```

This function first calculates the mean of the numbers using the `reduce` method, then calculates the absolute differences between each number and the mean using the `map` method. Finally, it calculates the mean of these absolute differences and returns it.
