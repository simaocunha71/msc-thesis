To calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) around the mean of a dataset, you can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the mean (average) of the dataset.
2. For each number in the dataset, calculate the absolute difference between that number and the mean.
3. Sum up all the absolute differences.
4. Divide the sum by the number of elements in the dataset to get the average absolute difference, which is the Mean Absolute Deviation.

Here's how you can implement the `meanAbsoluteDeviation` function in JavaScript:

```javascript
const meanAbsoluteDeviation = (numbers) => {
  // Calculate the mean of the numbers
  const mean = numbers.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0) / numbers.length;

  // Calculate the absolute differences and find their sum
  const sumOfAbsoluteDifferences = numbers.reduce((acc, num) => acc + Math.abs(num - mean), 0);

  // Calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation
  const mad = sumOfAbsoluteDifferences / numbers.length;

  return mad;
};
```

This function takes an array of numbers as input and returns the Mean Absolute Deviation around the mean of the dataset. It uses the `reduce` method to sum up the numbers, and the `Math.abs` function to get the absolute value of the differences. The final MAD is calculated by dividing the sum of the absolute differences by the number of elements in the dataset.
