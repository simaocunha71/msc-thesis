You can use the `split` method to split the string into sentences based on the delimiters ('.', '?', '!'), and then use the `filter` method to count the number of sentences that start with the word "I". Here's the updated solution:

```javascript
const isBored = (S) => {
  // Split the string into sentences based on the delimiters
  const sentences = S.split(/\.|\?|\!/);

  // Count the number of sentences that start with the word "I"
  const boredoms = sentences.filter(sentence => sentence.trim().startsWith("I")).length;

  return boredoms;
}
```

Here's an example usage of the `isBored` function:

```javascript
console.log(isBored("Hello world")); // 0
console.log(isBored("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather")); // 1
```
