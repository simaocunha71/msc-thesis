To decode a string that has been encoded with the `encodeCyclic` function, you need to reverse the process. Here's how you can implement the `decodeCyclic` function:

```javascript
const decodeCyclic = (s) => {
  var groups = [], groups2 = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < Math.floor((s.length + 2) / 3); i++) {
    groups.push(s.slice(3 * i, Math.min((3 * i + 3), s.length)));
  }
  for (const group of groups) {
    if (group.length == 3)
      groups2.push(group[group.length - 1] + group.slice(0, group.length - 1));
    else
      groups2.push(group);
  }
  return groups2.join('');
}
```

In this implementation, we follow the same steps as in the `encodeCyclic` function to split the input string into groups of three characters. Then, for each group, we shift all characters to the right by one position, except for the last character, which moves to the first position. Finally, we join the groups back together to form the decoded string.
