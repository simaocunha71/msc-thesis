Here is the solution for the problem:

```javascript
const encodeCyclic = (s) => {
  var groups = [], groups2 = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < Math.floor((s.length + 2) / 3); i++) {
    groups.push(s.slice(3 * i, Math.min((3 * i + 3), s.length)));
  }
  for (const group of groups) {
    if (group.length == 3)
      groups2.push(group.slice(1) + group[0]);
    else
      groups2.push(group);
  }
  return groups2.join('');
}

const decodeCyclic = (s) => {
  var groups = [], groups2 = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < Math.floor((s.length + 2) / 3); i++) {
    groups.push(s.slice(3 * i, Math.min((3 * i + 3), s.length)));
  }
  for (const group of groups) {
    if (group.length == 3)
      groups2.push(group.slice(-1) + group.slice(0, -1));
    else
      groups2.push(group);
  }
  return groups2.join('');
}
```

The `encodeCyclic` function takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string with each group of three characters shifted by one position to the right. If a group has fewer than three characters, it is left unchanged.

The `decodeCyclic` function takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string with each group of three characters shifted by one position to the left. If a group has fewer than three characters, it is left unchanged.
