To decode a string encoded with the `encodeCyclic` function, we need to reverse the encoding process. That means we need to take each group of three characters, cycle the characters to the left, and then concatenate them back into a single string.

Here's the implementation of the `decodeCyclic` function:

```javascript
const decodeCyclic = (s) => {
  var groups = [], groups2 = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < Math.floor((s.length + 2) / 3); i++) {
    groups.push(s.slice(3 * i, Math.min((3 * i + 3), s.length)));
  }
  for (const group of groups) {
    if (group.length == 3)
      groups2.push(group[2] + group.slice(0, 2));
    else
      groups2.push(group);
  }
  return groups2.join('');
}
```

In this function, we first split the input string into groups of three characters using the same logic as in the `encodeCyclic` function. Then, for each group, we check its length. If it's three characters long, we cycle the characters to the left by moving the last character to the first position. If it's less than three characters long, we leave it as is. Finally, we concatenate all the groups back into a single string and return it.
