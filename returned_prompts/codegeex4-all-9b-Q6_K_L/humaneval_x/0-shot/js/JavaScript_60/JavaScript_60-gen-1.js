The sum of numbers from 1 to n can be calculated using the formula n*(n+1)/2. Here's how you could implement the sumToN function:

```javascript
const sumToN = (n) => {
  return n * (n + 1) / 2;
}
```

The function takes a single argument `n` and returns the sum of all numbers from 1 to `n`. The formula `n * (n + 1) / 2` is used to calculate the sum, where `n` is the number up to which the sum is calculated.
