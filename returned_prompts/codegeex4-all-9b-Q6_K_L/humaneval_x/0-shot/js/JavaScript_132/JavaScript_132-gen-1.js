Here is the JavaScript solution for the problem:

```javascript
const isNested = (string) => {
  let count = 0;
  let maxCount = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < string.length; i++) {
    if (string[i] == '[') {
      count++;
    } else if (string[i] == ']') {
      count--;
    }
    if (count > maxCount) {
      maxCount = count;
    }
  }
  return maxCount > 0;
}
```

This function works by iterating over the string and counting the number of open brackets. If the count is ever greater than the maximum count seen so far, we update the maximum count. At the end, if the maximum count is greater than zero, it means there is a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket in the subsequence is nested.
