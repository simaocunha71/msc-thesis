```
  const collatzSeq = [];
  let current = n;
  while (current !== 1) {
    if (current % 2 === 0) {
      collatzSeq.push(current);
      current = current / 2;
    } else {
      collatzSeq.push(current);
      current = current * 3 + 1;
    }
  }
  collatzSeq.push(1);
  return collatzSeq.filter((num) => num % 2 !== 0).sort((a, b) => a - b);
};
```
The above solution is correct and efficient. It generates the Collatz sequence for a given integer `n` and then filters out the odd numbers from the sequence, sorting them in ascending order before returning them. The time complexity of the solution is O(log(n)) due to the halving of `n` in each iteration of the while loop. The space complexity is also O(log(n)) as we are storing the Collatz sequence in an array.
