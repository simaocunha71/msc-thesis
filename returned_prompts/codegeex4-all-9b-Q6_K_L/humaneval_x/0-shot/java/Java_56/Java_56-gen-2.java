Here is a simple Java solution using a stack:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public boolean correctBracketing(String brackets) {
        Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();
        
        for (char c : brackets.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == '<') {
                stack.push(c);
            } else if (c == '>') {
                if (stack.isEmpty() || stack.pop() != '<') {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return stack.isEmpty();
    }
}
```

This solution works by iterating over each character in the input string. If the character is '<', it is pushed onto the stack. If the character is '>', the stack is checked to see if it is empty or if the top of the stack is not '<'. If either of these conditions is true, the function returns false. Otherwise, the top of the stack is popped. At the end of the function, if the stack is empty, the function returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

This solution is correct because it checks that every '<' has a corresponding '>' and vice versa. It does this by pushing '<' onto the stack and popping '>' off the stack, which ensures that every '>' has a corresponding '<' and vice versa. If the stack is empty at the end of the function, it means that every '<' has a corresponding '>' and vice versa, so the function returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.
