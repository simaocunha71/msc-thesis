Here is a simple solution in Java:

```java
public int carRaceCollision(int n) {
    return n * n;
}
```

This solution works because when two sets of `n` cars are driving in opposite directions, there will always be `n * n` collisions, as each car in one set will collide with every car in the other set.

This solution assumes that no car is allowed to pass another car, and that each car only collides once. If the problem statement is different, the solution might need to be adjusted.
