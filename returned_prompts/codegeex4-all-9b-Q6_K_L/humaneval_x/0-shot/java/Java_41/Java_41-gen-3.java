Here is a Java solution for the problem. The solution assumes that the cars are driving at the same speed and start from the same position but on opposite sides of the road. The cars moving left to right and right to left will collide when they are at the same position at the same time. Therefore, the number of collisions is equal to the number of cars driving in each direction.

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    /**
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from
    each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    This function outputs the number of such collisions.
     */
    public int carRaceCollision(int n) {
        return n;
    }
}
```
The function `carRaceCollision` takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of cars driving in each direction. It returns the number of collisions, which is also `n`.
