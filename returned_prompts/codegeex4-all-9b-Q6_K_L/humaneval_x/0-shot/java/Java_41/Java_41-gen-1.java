To solve this problem, we can use a simple mathematical approach. Since the cars move in the same speed and the road is infinitely long, the number of collisions is equal to the number of cars moving in both directions. Therefore, the number of collisions is equal to n.

Here is the updated code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    public int carRaceCollision(int n) {
        return n;
    }
}
```

This code will return the correct number of collisions for any given value of n.
