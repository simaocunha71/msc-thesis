```java
public int fib(int n) {
    if(n == 0) return 0;
    if(n == 1) return 1;
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
}
```
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. That is, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so forth. In mathematical terms, the sequence Fn of Fibonacci numbers is defined by the recurrence relation

Fn = Fn−1 + Fn−2

with initial conditions F0 = 0 and F1 = 1.

The function `fib` calculates the nth Fibonacci number. If n is 0 or 1, it simply returns n. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself to calculate the sum of the (n-1)th and (n-2)th Fibonacci numbers.
