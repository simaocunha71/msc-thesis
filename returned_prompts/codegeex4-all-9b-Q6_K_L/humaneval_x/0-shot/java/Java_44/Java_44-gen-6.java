To solve this problem, you need to understand how to convert a number from one base to another. The given function `changeBase` takes two arguments: `x`, the number to be converted, and `base`, the base to which `x` is to be converted. The function should return the string representation of the converted number.

Here is a step-by-step approach to solve this problem:

1. Initialize an empty string `result` to store the converted number.
2. While `x` is not zero:
    a. Compute the remainder of `x` divided by `base` using the modulus operator `%`. This gives the last digit of the converted number.
    b. Append this digit to `result` as a string.
    c. Update `x` by dividing it by `base` using integer division `//`. This removes the last digit from `x`.
3. Reverse the string `result` to get the correct order of digits.
4. Return the final string `result`.

Here is the updated code:

```java
public String changeBase(int x, int base) {
    String result = "";
    while (x != 0) {
        int digit = x % base;
        result = digit + result;
        x = x / base;
    }
    return result;
}
```

This code correctly converts a number `x` from base 10 to any base `base` less than 10.
