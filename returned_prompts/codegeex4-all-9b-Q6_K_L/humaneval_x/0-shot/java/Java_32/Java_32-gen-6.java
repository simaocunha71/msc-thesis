To solve the problem, you can use the Newton-Raphson method, which is an iterative method for finding roots of a real-valued function. Here is the updated code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    /**
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x^2 + .... xs[n] * x^n
     */
    public double poly(List<Double> xs, double x) {
        double result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < xs.size(); i++) {
            result += xs.get(i) * Math.pow(x, i);
        }
        return result;
    }
    
    /**
    xs are coefficients of a polynomial.
    findZero find x such that poly(x) = 0.
    findZero returns only only zero point, even if there are many.
    Moreover, findZero only takes list xs having even number of coefficients
    and largest non zero coefficient as it guarantees
    a solution.
    >>> findZero(Arrays.asList(1, 2)) // f(x) = 1 + 2x
    -0.5
    >>> findZero(Arrays.asList(-6, 11, -6, 1)) // (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
    1.0
     */
    public double findZero(List<Double> xs) {
        double x = 0; // Initial guess
        double epsilon = 0.00001; // Tolerance
        while (Math.abs(poly(xs, x)) > epsilon) {
            x = x - poly(xs, x) / (Math.pow(x, 2) * xs.get(2) + xs.get(1));
        }
        return x;
    }
}
```

In this code, we use the Newton-Raphson method to iteratively find the root of the polynomial. We start with an initial guess `x = 0` and a tolerance `epsilon = 0.00001`. In each iteration, we update `x` using the formula `x = x - poly(xs, x) / (Math.pow(x, 2) * xs.get(2) + xs.get(1))`, which is derived from the Newton-Raphson method.
