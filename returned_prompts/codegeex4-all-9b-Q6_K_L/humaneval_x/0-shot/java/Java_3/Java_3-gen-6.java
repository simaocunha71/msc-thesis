You can use a loop to iterate through the list of operations and keep track of the current balance. If the balance falls below zero at any point, you can return true. If the loop completes without the balance falling below zero, you can return false.

Here is an example implementation:

```java
public boolean belowZero(List<Integer> operations) {
    int balance = 0;
    for (int operation : operations) {
        balance += operation;
        if (balance < 0) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

This implementation starts with a balance of zero and adds each operation to the balance. If the balance falls below zero at any point, the function immediately returns true. If the loop completes without the balance falling below zero, the function returns false.
