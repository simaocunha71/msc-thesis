Here is a simple Java solution using a for-each loop to iterate through the list of operations. The balance is updated at each operation and checked if it falls below zero. If it does, the function immediately returns true. If the loop finishes without finding a negative balance, the function returns false.

```java
public boolean belowZero(List<Integer> operations) {
    int balance = 0;
    for (Integer operation : operations) {
        balance += operation;
        if (balance < 0) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```
This function assumes that the input list is not null. If the list can be null, you should add a null check at the start of the function.
