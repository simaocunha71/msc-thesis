Here is the Java solution for the problem:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    /**
    For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    >>> meanAbsoluteDeviation(Arrays.asList(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0))
    1.0
     */
    public double meanAbsoluteDeviation(List<Double> numbers) {

        // Calculate the mean of the numbers
        double sum = 0;
        for (double num : numbers) {
            sum += num;
        }
        double mean = sum / numbers.size();

        // Calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation
        double mad = 0;
        for (double num : numbers) {
            mad += Math.abs(num - mean);
        }
        mad /= numbers.size();

        return mad;
    }
}
```
This solution first calculates the mean of the numbers, then calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation by summing the absolute differences between each number and the mean, and finally dividing by the number of numbers to get the average.
