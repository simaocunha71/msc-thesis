I have implemented the `oddCount` method in the `Solution` class. This method takes a list of strings as input and returns a list of strings. For each string in the input list, the method calculates the number of odd digits in the string and constructs a new string using the calculated number. The new string is then added to the result list. Finally, the method returns the result list.

The `oddCount` method uses a nested loop structure. The outer loop iterates over each string in the input list. The inner loop iterates over each character in the current string. If the character is an odd digit (i.e., it is not divisible by 2), the `oddCount` variable is incremented. After the inner loop finishes, the constructed string is added to the result list. This process is repeated for all strings in the input list.
