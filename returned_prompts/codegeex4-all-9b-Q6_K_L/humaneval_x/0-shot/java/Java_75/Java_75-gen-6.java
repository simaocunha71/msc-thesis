To determine if a given number `a` is the multiplication of three prime numbers, we can follow these steps:

1. Check if `a` is a positive number. If it's not, return `false`.
2. Use a loop to divide `a` by prime numbers starting from 2 up to the square root of `a`. This is because a larger factor of `a` must be a multiple of a smaller factor that has already been checked.
3. If `a` is not divisible by a prime number during the loop, it means `a` is a prime number itself. In this case, we need to check if `a` can be expressed as the multiplication of three prime numbers.
4. To check if `a` is the multiplication of three prime numbers, we can divide `a` by each prime number starting from 2 up to the square root of `a` and count the number of prime factors. If the number of prime factors is exactly 3, return `true`.
5. If `a` can't be expressed as the multiplication of three prime numbers, return `false`.

Here is the complete code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    public boolean isMultiplyPrime(int a) {
        if (a <= 0) {
            return false;
        }

        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 2; i * i <= a; i++) {
            if (a % i == 0) {
                count++;
                a /= i;
                if (a == 1 || i * i > a) {
                    break;
                }
                if (isPrime(a)) {
                    count++;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }

        if (a != 1) {
            count++;
        }

        return count == 3;
    }

    private boolean isPrime(int num) {
        if (num <= 1) {
            return false;
        }
        for (int i = 2; i * i <= num; i++) {
            if (num % i == 0) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        System.out.println(solution.isMultiplyPrime(30));  // true
    }
}
```

In the `isMultiplyPrime` method, we first check if `a` is less than or equal to 0, in which
