To decode the string, we need to reverse the process that was used to encode it. This involves cycling the characters in each group of three back to their original positions. We can achieve this by reversing the steps taken in the `encodeCyclic` method.

Here is the updated `decodeCyclic` method:

```java
public String decodeCyclic(String s) {
    // Split string to groups. Each of length 3.
    List<String> groups = new ArrayList<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i += 3) {
        groups.add(s.substring(i, Math.min(i + 3, s.length())));
    }

    // Cycle elements in each group back to their original positions. Unless group has fewer elements than 3.
    for (int i = 0; i < groups.size(); i++) {
        if (groups.get(i).length() == 3) {
            groups.set(i, groups.get(i).charAt(2) + groups.get(i).substring(0, 2));
        }
    }

    return String.join("", groups);
}
```

This method will take the encoded string as input and return the decoded string. The `decodeCyclic` method reverses the `encodeCyclic` method by moving the first character of each group of three to the end of the group.
