Here is the Java solution for the problem:

```java
public boolean isEqualToSumEven(int n) {
    return n >= 8 && n % 2 == 0;
}
```

Explanation:
The sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers will always be an even number, so if `n` is not even or less than 8, it cannot be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. Hence, the function will return `false` in these cases.

If `n` is an even number and is greater than or equal to 8, it can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. Hence, the function will return `true` in this case.
