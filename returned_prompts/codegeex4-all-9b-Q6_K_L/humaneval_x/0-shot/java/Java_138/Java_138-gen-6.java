To solve this problem, we first check if the number is even. If it is not, we return false because the sum of four positive even numbers will always be even.

If the number is even, we then check if it is divisible by 4. If it is not, we return false because the sum of four even numbers cannot be a number that is not divisible by 4.

If the number is divisible by 4, we return true because it can be written as the sum of four positive even numbers. Otherwise, we return false.
Here is the complete code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    public boolean isEqualToSumEven(int n) {
        if (n % 2 != 0) {
            return false;
        }
        if (n % 4 != 0) {
            return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
