To calculate the special factorial of an integer, we need to calculate the factorial of each number from n down to 1, and then multiply all these factorials together.

Here is the Python code to solve this problem:

```python
def special_factorial(n):
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("n must be a non-negative integer")
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        factorial = 1
        for j in range(1, i + 1):
            factorial *= j
        result *= factorial
    return result
```

And here is the Java code to solve this problem:

```java
public class Solution {
    public static long specialFactorial(int n) {
        if (n < 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("n must be a non-negative integer");
        }
        if (n == 0) {
            return 1;
        }
        long result = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            long factorial = 1;
            for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
                factorial *= j;
            }
            result *= factorial;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

Both these solutions have a time complexity of O(n^2) because we need to calculate the factorial of each number from n down to 1. However, the space complexity is O(1) because we only need a constant amount of space to store the result.
