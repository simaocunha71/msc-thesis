To decode a string that has been encoded using the `encodeShift` method, you need to shift each character back by 5 positions in the alphabet. The `decodeShift` method should be similar to the `encodeShift` method, but with the shift amount reversed. Here's how you can implement the `decodeShift` method:

```java
public String decodeShift(String s) {
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
        sb.append((char) ('a' + ((ch + 21 - 'a') % 26))); // Shift back by 5 positions
    }
    return sb.toString();
}
```

In this implementation, `(char) ('a' + ((ch + 21 - 'a') % 26))` effectively shifts each character back by 5 positions in the alphabet. The expression `ch + 21` adjusts for the original shift of 5 (since 5 + 5 = 10, and 10 + 10 = 20, so 21 effectively reverses the shift). The modulo operation `% 26` ensures that the result wraps around within the range of the alphabet.
