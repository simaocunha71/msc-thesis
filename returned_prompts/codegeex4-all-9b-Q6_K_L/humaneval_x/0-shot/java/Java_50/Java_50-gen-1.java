To decode a string that was encoded with the `encodeShift` function, you need to reverse the encoding process. You can achieve this by shifting each character back by 5 positions in the alphabet. Here is the complete code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    /**
    returns encoded string by shifting every character by 5 in the alphabet.
     */
    public String encodeShift(String s) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            sb.append((char) ('a' + ((ch + 5 - 'a') % 26)));
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }

    /**
    takes as input string encoded with encodeShift function. Returns decoded string.
     */
    public String decodeShift(String s) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            sb.append((char) ('a' + ((ch - 5 + 26 - 'a') % 26)));
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```

In the `decodeShift` method, we shift each character back by 5 positions in the alphabet. We use the modulo operator `%` to handle the wrap-around of characters when they go past 'z' or before 'a'. The expression `(ch - 5 + 26 - 'a') % 26` ensures that the result is always a valid character code in the range of 'a' to 'z'.
