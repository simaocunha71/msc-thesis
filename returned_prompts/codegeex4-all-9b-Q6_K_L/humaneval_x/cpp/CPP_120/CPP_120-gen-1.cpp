The problem with this code is that it sorts the entire array and then returns the first `k` elements. However, this approach is not efficient as it sorts the entire array when we only need the top `k` elements. 

A better approach would be to use a max heap of size `k` to keep track of the top `k` elements. We can iterate over the array and for each element, we push it into the heap. If the size of the heap exceeds `k`, we pop the smallest element from the heap. Finally, we convert the heap into a sorted vector and return it.

Here is the corrected code:

```cpp
#include<stdio.h>
#include<vector>
#include<queue>
using namespace std;

vector<int> maximum(vector<int> arr,int k){
    priority_queue<int> pq; //max heap
    for(int i=0;i<arr.size();i++){
        pq.push(arr[i]);
        if(pq.size()>k){
            pq.pop
