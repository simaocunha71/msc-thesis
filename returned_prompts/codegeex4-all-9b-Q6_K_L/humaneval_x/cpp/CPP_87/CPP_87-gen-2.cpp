/*
You are given a 2 dimensional data, as a nested vectors,
which is similar to matrix, however, unlike matrices,
each row may contain a different number of columns.
Given lst, and integer x, find integers x in the vector,
and return vector of vectors, {{x1, y1}, {x2, y2} ...} such that
each vector is a coordinate - {row, columns}, starting with 0.
Sort coordinates initially by rows in ascending order.
Also, sort coordinates of the row by columns in descending order.

Examples:
get_row({
  {1,2,3,4,5,6},
  {1,2,3,4,1,6},
  {1,2,3,4,5,1}
}, 1) == {{0, 0}, {1, 4}, {1, 0}, {2, 5}, {2, 0}}
get_row({}, 1) == {}
get_row({{}, {1}, {1, 2, 3}}, 3) == {{2, 2}}
