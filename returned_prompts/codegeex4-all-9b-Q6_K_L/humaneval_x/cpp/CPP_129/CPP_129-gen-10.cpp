Given an array with N integers (1 <= N <= 10^5), each integer in the array
appears exactly once. You have to find the lexicographically smallest
subarray with length k (1 <= k <= N). Return an ordered vector with the
integers in the subarray.

Examples:

    Output: {1, 3, 3}

    Input: arr = {1, 3, 3, 2, 4, 1, 7}, k = 2

You are given two strings S and T, each of length N. You have to
construct a string U of length N from S and T such that U is a
subsequence of both S and T. In other words, U is a string which can be
obtained from S and T by deleting some characters without changing the
order of the remaining characters. You have to find the lexicographically
