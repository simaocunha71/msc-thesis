This solution is incorrect because the `+=` operator is used to concatenate the strings. However, this operator is not used for strings in C++. Instead, the `append` function should be used.

C:
This solution is incorrect because the `c_str()` function is used to get a pointer to the null-terminated string representation of the string object. However, this pointer is not a string and cannot be concatenated with the `+=` operator.

D:
This solution is incorrect because the `append` function is used to concatenate the strings, but the `c_str()` function is used to get a pointer to the null-terminated string representation of the string object. This pointer is not a string and cannot be concatenated
