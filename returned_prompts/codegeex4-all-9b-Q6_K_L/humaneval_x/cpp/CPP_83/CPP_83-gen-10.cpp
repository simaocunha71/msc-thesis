/*
Given an array arr of length n, we define the value of arr to be the sum of the
elements in arr that are in the subarray arr[0], arr[1], ..., arr[i], for all i
such that 0 <= i < n.
For example, if arr = [1, 2, 3], then the value of arr is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
Find the maximum value of the value of arr among all possible arrays arr of
length n.
