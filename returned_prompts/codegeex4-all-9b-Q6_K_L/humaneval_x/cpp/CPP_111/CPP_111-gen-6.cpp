You're right, the letter 'c' does not repeat in the string "a b c a b", so it should not be in the output. However, your code is adding it to the output because you're checking the count of each character in the string, and 'c' is the last character in the string, so it gets added to the output.

Here's the corrected code:

```cpp
#include<stdio.h>
#include<string>
#include<map>
using namespace std;

map<char,int> histogram(string test){
    map<char,int> letterCount;
    if(test == ""){
        return letterCount;
    }
    for(int i =
