The code you provided is a correct solution to the problem. Here's a brief explanation of how it works:

1. It defines a function `sum_squares` that takes a vector of floats as input and returns an integer.

2. Inside the function, it initializes a variable `sum` to 0. This variable will be used to store the sum of squared numbers.

3. It then loops through each element in the input vector using a for loop.

4. For each element, it rounds it up to the nearest integer using the `ceil` function from the math library.

5. It then squares the rounded number using the `pow` function and adds it to the `sum` variable.

6. After the loop, it returns the `sum` variable as the output of the function.

This code correctly solves the problem by rounding each element in the input vector to the nearest integer, squaring the rounded numbers, and summing them up. The output is an integer representing the sum of squared numbers in the input vector.
