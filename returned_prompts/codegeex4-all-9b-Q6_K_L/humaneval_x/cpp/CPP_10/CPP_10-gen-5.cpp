The code provided is an implementation of a function `make_palindrome` that takes a string as input and returns the shortest palindrome that begins with the given string. 

The function works by first finding the longest postfix of the input string that is a palindrome. Then, it appends to the end of the string the reverse of the prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix. 

The function `is_palindrome` is used to check if a given string is a palindrome. It compares the string with its reverse and returns true if they are equal, and false otherwise. 

The code is correct and should work as expected.
