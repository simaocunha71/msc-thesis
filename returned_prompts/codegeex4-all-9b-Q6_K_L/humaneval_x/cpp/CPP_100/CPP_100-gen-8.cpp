Given a positive integer n, you have to make a pile of n levels of stones.
The first level has n stones.
The number of stones in the next level is:
    - the next odd number if n is odd.
    - the next even number if n is even.
Return the number of stones in each level in a vector, where element at index
i represents the number of stones in the level (i+1).
