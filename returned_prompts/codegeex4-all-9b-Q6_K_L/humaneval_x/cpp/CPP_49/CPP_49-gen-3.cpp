请根据题目要求，选择正确的代码：

A
B
C
D
E

G
H

The correct code is:

E: `def modp(n, p): return 2**n % p`

This code uses the pow function from the math module to calculate 2^n % p, which is the remainder when 2^n is divided by p. This is exactly what the problem statement is asking for. 

The other options do not correctly implement the problem statement. For example, option A uses the pow function, but it does not take p as the third argument, which is necessary for this problem. Option B uses the ** operator, but it does not use the modulo operator, which is necessary for this problem. Option C uses the ** operator, but it does not use the modulo operator, which is necessary for this problem. Option D uses the ** operator, but it uses the modulo operator on the exponent, which is not what the problem statement is asking for. Option F uses the pow function, but it does not use the modulo operator, which is necessary for this problem. Option G uses the pow function, but it uses 2**n as the first argument, which is not what the problem statement is asking for. Option H uses the ** operator, but it uses the modulo operator on the exponent, which is not what the problem statement is asking for.
