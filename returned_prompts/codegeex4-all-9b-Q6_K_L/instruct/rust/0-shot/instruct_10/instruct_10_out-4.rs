    for cmd in commands {

            .arg(cmd)
            .output()

                }
            },
            Err(e) => {
                error.push(cmd.to_string());
            }
        }
    }

    Err(error)
}

fn main() {
    let path = env::args().nth(1).unwrap_or(String::from("README.md"));
    match open_file(path) {
        Ok(cmd) => {
            println!("Command to open file: {}", cmd);
        },
        Err(error) => {
            println!("Error: {:?}", error);
        }
    }
}
```

The code is a simple implementation of the problem statement. It first tries to find the `$BROWSER` command and if it is not found, it tries the other commands in the order given. If none of the commands are found, it returns an error containing the list of attempted commands.

The code uses the `std::process::Command` module to execute the commands and the `std::env::args` module to get the command line arguments. The `open_file` function takes a path as a string argument and returns a `Result` type. If the command is found, it returns an `Ok` variant containing the name of the command. If the command is not found, it returns an `Err` variant containing the list of attempted commands.

The `main` function gets the path from the command line arguments and calls the `open_file` function. If the function returns an `Ok` variant, it prints the name of the command. If the function returns an `Err` variant, it prints the list of attempted commands.

The code can be tested by running it with a path to a file. For example, if the path is `README.md`, the output should be `xdg-open`. If the path is `does_not_exist.txt`, the output should be a list containing the names of the attempted commands.
