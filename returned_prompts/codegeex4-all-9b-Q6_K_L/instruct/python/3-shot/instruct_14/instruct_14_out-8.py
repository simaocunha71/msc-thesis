Here is a Python function that tests API endpoints for retrieving and deleting asset types, using standard library functions and JSON serialization/deserialization, and logs relevant information to a logger:

```python
import json
import logging
import requests

def test_asset_types_api(logger):
    url = "http://example.com/api/asset_types"
    headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}
    
    # Test retrieving asset types
    logger.info("Testing retrieving asset types")
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        logger.info("Successfully retrieved asset types")
        asset_types = json.loads(response.text)
        logger.info(f"Retrieved {len(asset_types)} asset types")
    else:
        logger.error(f"Failed to retrieve asset types: {response.status_code}")
    
    # Test deleting asset types
    logger.info("Testing deleting asset types")
    response = requests.delete(url, headers=headers)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        logger.info("Successfully deleted asset types")
    else:
        logger.error(f"Failed to delete asset types: {response.status_code}")
```

In this function, we first define the URL and headers for the API endpoints. Then, we test retrieving asset types by making a GET request to the API endpoint. If the response status code is 200, we log a success message and deserialize the response text into a list of asset types. We also log the number of asset types retrieved. If the response status code is not 200, we log an error message.

Next, we test deleting asset types by making a DELETE request to the API endpoint. If the response status code is 200, we log a success message. Otherwise, we log an error message.

Note that you will need to replace the URL with the actual API endpoint you are testing.
