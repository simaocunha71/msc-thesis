Here is a simple solution in Java. It iterates through the list of numbers and checks if any two numbers are closer to each other than the given threshold.

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public boolean hasCloseElements(List<Double> numbers, double threshold) {
        for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < numbers.size(); j++) {
                if (Math.abs(numbers.get(i) - numbers.get(j)) < threshold) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) where n is the size of the list of numbers. This is because it iterates through the list of numbers and for each number, it iterates through the rest of the list. If the list of numbers is large, this solution may be slow. 

If you need a more efficient solution, you could sort the list of numbers first and then iterate through it to find any two numbers that are closer to each other than the given threshold. This would have a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting. Here is an example of how you could do this:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public boolean hasCloseElements(List<Double> numbers, double threshold) {
        Collections.sort(numbers);
        for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size() - 1; i++) {
            if (Math.abs(numbers.get(i) - numbers.get(i + 1)) < threshold) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

This solution is more efficient than the previous one, especially for large lists of numbers. However, it requires that the list of numbers be sorted, which may not always be the case. 

It's worth noting that the problem doesn't specify whether the list of numbers is sorted or not. If the list is not sorted, then the first solution may be the best choice. If the list is sorted, then the second solution may be the best choice. If the list may or may not be sorted, then you would need to add code to sort the list if it's not already sorted. This would add to the complexity of the solution. 

In general, it's always a good idea to carefully read and understand the problem you're trying to solve before writing code to solve it. This can help you come up
