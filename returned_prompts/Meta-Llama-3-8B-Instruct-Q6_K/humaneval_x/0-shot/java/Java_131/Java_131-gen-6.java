                product *= digit;
            }

S:

The given solution is correct and it uses a while loop to extract the digits of the given number. It uses the modulus operator to get the last digit of the number and then checks if the digit is odd or even. If the digit is odd, it multiplies the product with that digit. Finally, it returns the product of the odd digits. If all digits are even, the product will be 0. Here is the correct solution:

```java
public int digits(int n) {
    int product = 1;
    int digit;
    while (n > 0) {
        digit = n % 10;
        if (digit % 2 != 0) {
            product *= digit;
        }
        n = n / 10;
    }
    return product;
}
```

In this solution, we use a while loop to extract the digits of the given number. We use the modulus operator to get the last digit of the number and then check if the digit is odd or even. If the digit is odd, we multiply the product with that digit. Finally, we return the product of the odd digits. If all digits are even, the product will be 0. This solution works correctly and has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the given number. The space complexity is O(1), which means it uses a constant amount of space.
