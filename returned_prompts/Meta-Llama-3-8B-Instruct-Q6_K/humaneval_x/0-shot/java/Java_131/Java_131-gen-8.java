        int product = 1;
        while (n > 0) {
            int digit = n % 10;
            if (digit % 2 != 0) {
                product *= digit;
            }
            n /= 10;
        }
        return product;
    }
}

S:
The problem is asking to find the product of all odd digits in a given positive integer. If there are no odd digits, the product should be 0.

We can solve this problem by using a while loop to iterate through each digit of the number, checking if the digit is odd or even. If the digit is odd, we multiply it with our product. At the end of the loop, we return the product.

Here is the solution in Java:

```java
public int digits(int n) {
    int product = 1;
    while (n > 0) {
        int digit = n % 10;
        if (digit % 2 != 0) {
            product *= digit;
        }
        n /= 10;
    }
    return product;
}
```

In this solution, we use the modulus operator `%` to get the last digit of the number. We then check if the digit is odd by using the condition `digit % 2 != 0`. If the digit is odd, we multiply it with our product. We then move on to the next digit by using the division operator `/`. We repeat this process until there are no more digits left in the number. Finally, we return the product. If all digits are even, the product will be 0.
