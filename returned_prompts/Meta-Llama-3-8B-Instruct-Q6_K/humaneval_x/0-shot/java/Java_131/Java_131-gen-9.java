        int product = 1;
        while(n > 0) {
            int digit = n % 10;
            if(digit % 2 != 0) {
                product *= digit;
            }
            n /= 10;
        }
        return product;
    }
}

Explanation:
The problem is asking to find the product of all the odd digits in a given positive integer. If all the digits are even, the function should return 0.

The solution uses a while loop to iterate through each digit of the input integer. For each digit, it checks if the digit is odd by using the modulus operator (%). If the digit is odd, it multiplies the product variable with the digit. Finally, the function returns the product.

For example, if the input is 235, the function will iterate through each digit: 2 (even), 3 (odd), 5 (odd). The product will be 3 * 5 = 15, which is the result returned by the function. If the input is 4, the function will return 0 because all the digits are even.
