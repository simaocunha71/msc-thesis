The task is to find the string with the maximum number of unique characters. If there are multiple strings with the same maximum number of unique characters, return the one that comes first in lexicographical order.

Here is the Java solution for the problem:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public String findMax(List<String> words) {
        if (words == null || words.isEmpty()) {
            return "";
        }
        String result = words.get(0);
        int maxUnique = 0;
        for (String word : words) {
            Set<Character> set = new HashSet<>();
            for (char c : word.toCharArray()) {
                set.add(c);
            }
            if (set.size() > maxUnique) {
                maxUnique = set.size();
                result = word;
            } else if (set.size() == maxUnique) {
                result = result.compareTo(word) < 0 ? result : word;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
The solution iterates through each word in the list. For each word, it converts the word into a set of unique characters. It then checks if the size of the set is greater than the current maximum unique count. If it is, it updates the maximum unique count and the result string. If the size of the set is equal to the maximum unique count, it compares the current word with the result string lexicographically and updates the result string if the current word is smaller.

The solution returns the result string which is the word with the maximum number of unique characters. If there are multiple words with the same maximum number of unique characters, it returns the one that comes first in lexicographical order.
