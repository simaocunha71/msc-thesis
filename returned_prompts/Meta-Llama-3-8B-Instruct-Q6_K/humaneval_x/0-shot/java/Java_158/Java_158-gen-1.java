The problem is asking to find the word with the maximum number of unique characters in a given list of words. If there are multiple words with the maximum number of unique characters, return the one that comes first in lexicographical order.

Here is a Java solution using a HashMap to count the unique characters in each word and then selecting the word with the maximum count:

```java
public String findMax(List<String> words) {
    String maxWord = "";
    int maxCount = 0;
    for (String word : words) {
        Map<Character, Integer> charCount = new HashMap<>();
        for (char c : word.toCharArray()) {
            charCount.put(c, charCount.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
        }
        int count = charCount.size();
        if (count > maxCount) {
            maxCount = count;
            maxWord = word;
        } else if (count == maxCount) {
            if (word.compareTo(maxWord) < 0) {
                maxWord = word;
            }
        }
    }
    return maxWord;
}
```

This solution iterates through each word in the list, counts the unique characters using a HashMap, and updates the maximum count and the corresponding word if necessary. If there are multiple words with the maximum count, it selects the one that comes first in lexicographical order. Finally, it returns the selected word.
