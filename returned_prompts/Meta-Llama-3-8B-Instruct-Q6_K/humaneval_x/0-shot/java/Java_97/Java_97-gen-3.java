    return (a % 10) * (b % 10);
}

Explanation:
The problem asks to create a function that takes two integers and returns the product of their unit digits. The unit digit of a number is the last digit of the number. For example, the unit digit of 148 is 8, and the unit digit of 412 is 2.

The function `multiply(a, b)` does exactly this. It uses the modulus operator `%` to get the unit digit of each number. The unit digit of a number `n` can be obtained by `n % 10`. The function then multiplies the unit digits of `a` and `b` and returns the result.

For example, if `a` is 148 and `b` is 412, the function will return `(148 % 10) * (412 % 10) = 8 * 2 = 16`. If `a` is 19 and `b` is 28, the function will return `(19 % 10) * (28 % 10) = 9 * 8 = 72`. If `a` is 2020 and `b` is 1851, the function will return `(2020 % 10) * (1851 % 10) = 0 * 1 = 0`. If `a` is 14 and `b` is -15, the function will return `(14 % 10) * (-15 % 10) = 4 * (-5) = 20`. 

This solution is simple and efficient, as it only requires a single line of code to calculate the product of the unit digits. It does not require any loops or complex calculations, making it a good solution for this problem.
