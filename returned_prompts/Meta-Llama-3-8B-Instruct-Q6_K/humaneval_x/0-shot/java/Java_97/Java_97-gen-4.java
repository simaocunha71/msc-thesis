        return (a % 10) * (b % 10);  // Return the product of the unit digits of a and b.
    }

Explanation:
This problem is asking to create a function that takes two integers and returns the product of their unit digits. The unit digits are the last digits of the numbers, which can be obtained by taking the modulus of the number with 10.

In the given solution, we are using the modulus operator (%) to get the last digits of the numbers. We are multiplying these last digits and returning the result.

For example, if we call the function with the arguments 148 and 412, the function will return the product of the last digits of 148 (8) and 412 (2), which is 16. Similarly, if we call the function with the arguments 19 and 28, the function will return the product of the last digits of 19 (9) and 28 (8), which is 72. If we call the function with the arguments 2020 and 1851, the function will return the product of the last digits of 2020 (0) and 1851 (1), which is 0. If we call the function with the arguments 14 and -15, the function will return the product of the last digits of 14 (4) and -15 (-5), which is 20.
