Explanation:
In this problem, we need to find the product of the unit digits of two given integers. The unit digit of a number is the remainder when the number is divided by 10. 

We can achieve this by using the modulus operator (%) to get the remainder when the number is divided by 10. The remainder will be the unit digit of the number.

For example, the unit digit of the number 148 is 8 (since 148 % 10 = 8). Similarly, the unit digit of the number 412 is 2 (since 412 % 10 = 2).

Once we have the unit digits, we can simply multiply them together to get the product of the unit digits.

In the given code, we are using the modulus operator to get the unit digits of the given numbers and then multiplying them together to get the product of the unit digits. The function `multiply(int a, int b)` returns the product of the unit digits of the numbers `a` and `b`. 

For example, if we call the function `multiply(148, 412)`, it will return `8 * 2 = 16`, which is the product of the unit digits of the numbers 148 and 412. Similarly, if we call the function `multiply(19, 28)`, it will return `9 * 8 = 72`, which is the product of the unit digits of the numbers 19 and 28. 

The function `multiply(int a, int b)` works correctly for all valid inputs and returns the correct product of the unit digits. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(1) because it uses a constant amount of time to calculate the product of the unit digits, regardless of the size of the input numbers. The space complexity is also O(1) because it uses a constant amount of space to store the unit digits and the product.
