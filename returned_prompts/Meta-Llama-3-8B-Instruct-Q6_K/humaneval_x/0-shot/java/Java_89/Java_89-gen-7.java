```java
public String encrypt(String s) {
    StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
    for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
        if (Character.isLetter(c)) {
            char base = Character.isUpperCase(c) ? 'A' : 'a';
            result.append((char) ((c - base + 4 * 2) % 26 + base));
        } else {
            result.append(c);
        }
    }
    return result.toString();
}
```

Explanation:
This code uses a StringBuilder to efficiently build the encrypted string. It iterates over each character in the input string, and for each character, it checks if it's a letter. If it is, it calculates the new character by shifting the original character down by 4 positions (2 * 2) in the alphabet, wrapping around to the beginning of the alphabet if necessary. If the character is not a letter, it simply appends the original character to the result. Finally, it returns the encrypted string as a string.
