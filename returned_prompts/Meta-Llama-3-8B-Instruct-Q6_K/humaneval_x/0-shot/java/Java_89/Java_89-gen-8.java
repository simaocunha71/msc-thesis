```java
public String encrypt(String s) {
    StringBuilder encrypted = new StringBuilder();
    for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
        if (Character.isLetter(c)) {
            char base = Character.isUpperCase(c) ? 'A' : 'a';
            encrypted.append((char) ((c - base + 8) % 26 + base));
        } else {
            encrypted.append(c);
        }
    }
    return encrypted.toString();
}
```

Explanation:
The problem asks to create a function `encrypt` that takes a string as an argument and returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being rotated. The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters shift down by two multiplied to two places.

In the solution, we iterate over each character in the input string. If the character is a letter, we calculate the new character by subtracting the ASCII value of the base character (either 'A' or 'a' depending on whether the original character is uppercase or lowercase), adding 8, taking the modulus with 26 (the number of letters in the alphabet), and then adding the base character back. This effectively rotates the alphabet by 8 positions.

If the character is not a letter (e.g., a space or punctuation mark), we simply append it to the encrypted string as is.

Finally, we return the encrypted string as a `String` object. The `StringBuilder` class is used to efficiently build the encrypted string. The `toCharArray()` method is used to convert the input string to an array of characters, which can be iterated over. The `append()` method is used to add characters to the `StringBuilder` object. The `toString()` method is used to convert the `StringBuilder` object to a `String` object.
