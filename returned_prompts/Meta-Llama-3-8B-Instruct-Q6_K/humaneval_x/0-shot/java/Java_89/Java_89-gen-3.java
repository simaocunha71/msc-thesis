```java
public String encrypt(String s) {
    StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
    for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
        if (Character.isLetter(c)) {
            char base = Character.isUpperCase(c) ? 'A' : 'a';
            result.append((char) ((c - base + 8) % 26 + base));
        } else {
            result.append(c);
        }
    }
    return result.toString();
}
```

Explanation:
The problem is asking to create a function that encrypts a given string by shifting the alphabet down by 8 places. This means that 'a' becomes 'i', 'b' becomes 'j', 'c' becomes 'k', and so on. If the character is not a letter (like a space or punctuation), it should be left unchanged.

Here's how the solution works:
1. Iterate over each character in the input string.
2. Check if the character is a letter. If it is, calculate the new character by subtracting the base character ('A' or 'a') from the character, adding 8, and then taking the result modulo 26. This effectively shifts the alphabet down by 8 places.
3. If the character is not a letter, simply append it to the result string as is.
4. Finally, return the encrypted string.

Note that the base character is chosen based on whether the original character is uppercase or lowercase. This ensures that the encryption works correctly for both uppercase and lowercase letters.
