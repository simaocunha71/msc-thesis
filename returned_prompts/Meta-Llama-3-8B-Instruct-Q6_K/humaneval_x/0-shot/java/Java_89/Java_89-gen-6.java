The given problem is about creating a function that encrypts a given string by rotating the alphabet. The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters shift down by two multiplied to two places. This means that 'a' becomes 'l', 'b' becomes 'm', and so on.

Here's the solution in Java:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public String encrypt(String s) {
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (Character.isLetter(c)) {
                char base = Character.isUpperCase(c) ? 'A' : 'a';
                result.append((char) ((c - base + 2 * 2) % 26 + base));
            } else {
                result.append(c);
            }
        }
        return result.toString();
    }
}
```

In this solution, we use a `StringBuilder` to build the result string. We iterate over each character in the input string. If the character is a letter, we calculate the new character by shifting it down by two multiplied to two places. We use the modulus operator (`%`) to ensure that the result is within the range of the alphabet (0-25). We use the `Character.isUpperCase` method to determine whether the original character was uppercase or lowercase, and adjust the base character accordingly. If the character is not a letter, we simply append it to the result string. Finally, we return the result string.
