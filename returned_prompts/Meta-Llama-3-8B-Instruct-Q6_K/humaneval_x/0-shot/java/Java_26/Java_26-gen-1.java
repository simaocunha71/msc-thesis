Explanation:
This code uses the Java Stream API to remove duplicates from a list of integers. It uses the `distinct()` function to remove duplicates, and `collect(Collectors.toList())` to collect the result into a new list.

The `distinct()` function works by using a hash set to keep track of the elements it has seen so far. It then returns a new stream that contains only the elements that are not in the set. This effectively removes all duplicates from the stream.

The `collect(Collectors.toList())` function is used to collect the result of the `distinct()` function into a new list. This list contains only the unique elements from the original stream, in the same order as they appeared in the original stream.

The `removeDuplicates()` method takes a list of integers as input, and returns a new list that contains only the unique elements from the input list. The order of the elements in the output list is the same as the order in which they appeared in the input list.

For example, if you call `removeDuplicates(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 2, 4))`, the output will be `[1, 3, 4]`, which are the unique elements from the input list in the same order.
