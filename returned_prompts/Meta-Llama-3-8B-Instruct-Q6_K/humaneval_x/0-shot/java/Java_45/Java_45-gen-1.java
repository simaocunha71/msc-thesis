    return 0.5 * a * h;
}

Explanation:
The area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula `0.5 * a * h`, where `a` is the length of the side and `h` is the height of the triangle. This formula is widely used in geometry and is applicable to most types of triangles. In this problem, we are given the length of the side `a` and the height `h`, and we need to calculate the area of the triangle. The `triangleArea` function takes two arguments, `a` and `h`, and returns the calculated area as a double value. The function is implemented in the `Solution` class, which is a common practice in Java programming. The `>>>` symbol is used to represent the expected output of the function, which is `7.5` in this case.
