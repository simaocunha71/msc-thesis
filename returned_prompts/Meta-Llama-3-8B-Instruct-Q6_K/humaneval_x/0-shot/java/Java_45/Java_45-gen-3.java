Explanation:
The problem is asking to calculate the area of a triangle given the length of one side (a) and the height (h) of the triangle. The formula for the area of a triangle is 0.5 * base * height, where the base is the length of one side and the height is the height of the triangle.

In this solution, we define a method `triangleArea` that takes two parameters, `a` and `h`, which represent the length of one side and the height of the triangle, respectively. The method returns the area of the triangle, which is calculated using the formula 0.5 * a * h.

For example, if you call the method with `a = 5` and `h = 3`, it will return `7.5`, which is the area of the triangle with a base of 5 units and a height of 3 units.
