        return (a * h) / 2;
    }
}

Explanation:
The problem is asking for the area of a triangle given the length of one side (a) and the height (h) of the triangle. The formula to calculate the area of a triangle is (base * height) / 2, where the base is the length of the side and the height is the height of the triangle.

The Java code provided uses this formula to calculate the area of the triangle. The method `triangleArea` takes two parameters, `a` and `h`, which are the length of the side and the height of the triangle, respectively. The method returns the calculated area of the triangle.

The unit test `>>> triangleArea(5, 3)` is used to test the method with the values a = 5 and h = 3, which should return the area 7.5.
