Explanation:
The problem is asking to calculate the area of a triangle given the length of a side (a) and the height (h). The formula for the area of a triangle is (0.5 * a * h).

The provided solution is correct. It defines a method `triangleArea` that takes two parameters, `a` and `h`, and returns the area of the triangle calculated using the formula.

In the main part, an instance of the `Solution` class is created, and the `triangleArea` method is called with the arguments 5 and 3. The result is then printed to the console, which is 7.5 in this case.
