        return 0.5 * a * h; // 0.5 * a * h is the formula for the area of a triangle
    }
}

Explanation:
The problem is asking to calculate the area of a triangle given the length of its base (a) and its height (h). The formula for the area of a triangle is 0.5 * base * height, which is implemented in the provided Java code. The function `triangleArea` takes two parameters, `a` and `h`, and returns the calculated area as a double value. The unit test in the docstring checks if the function returns the correct area for a triangle with base 5 and height 3, which is indeed 7.5.
