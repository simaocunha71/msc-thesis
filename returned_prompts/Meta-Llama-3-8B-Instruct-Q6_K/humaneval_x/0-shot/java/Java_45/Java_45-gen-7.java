Explanation:
This Java program is a simple implementation of the formula for the area of a triangle, given the length of a side (a) and the height (h). The formula is:

A = 0.5 * a * h

Where A is the area of the triangle, a is the length of the side, and h is the height.

The `triangleArea` method takes two parameters, `a` and `h`, and returns the calculated area. The method uses the formula to calculate the area, and the result is returned as a double value.

The unit test `>>> triangleArea(5, 3)` demonstrates how to use the method, by calculating the area of a triangle with a side length of 5 and a height of 3. The expected result is 7.5.
