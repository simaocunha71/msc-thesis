The problem is asking to rescale a list of numbers to the unit interval [0, 1], where the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1. This is a linear transformation, which can be done by subtracting the smallest number and dividing by the range of the numbers.

Here is the solution in Java:
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<Double> rescaleToUnit(List<Double> numbers) {
        if (numbers.size() < 2) {
            throw new RuntimeException("List must have at least two elements");
        }
        double min = Collections.min(numbers);
        double max = Collections.max(numbers);
        List<Double> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (double num : numbers) {
            result.add((num - min) / (max - min));
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
Here's an explanation of the code:

1. First, we check if the list has at least two elements. If not, we throw a `RuntimeException`.
2. We find the minimum and maximum values in the list using `Collections.min()` and `Collections.max()`.
3. We create a new list `result` to store the rescaled values.
4. We iterate over the original list and for each value, we subtract the minimum value and divide by the range (max - min). This gives us a value in the range [0, 1].
5. We add each rescaled value to the `result` list.
6. Finally, we return the `result` list.

You can test this method with the example input `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]` to see that it produces the expected output `[0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]`.
