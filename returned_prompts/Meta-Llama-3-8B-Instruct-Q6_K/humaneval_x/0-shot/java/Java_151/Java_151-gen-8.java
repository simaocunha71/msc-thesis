Explanation:
The provided Java code defines a method called `doubleTheDifference` that takes a list of objects as an input parameter. The method iterates through the list and checks each object to see if it's an instance of the `Integer` class and if its value is positive. If the object meets these conditions, the method adds the square of the object's value to a running total. Finally, the method returns the total sum.

The method handles edge cases by checking if the input list is empty, and if so, returns 0. It also ignores negative numbers and non-integer values in the list.

The provided test cases demonstrate the method's functionality, including handling empty lists, lists with only positive numbers, and lists with a mix of positive and negative numbers. The method correctly calculates the sum of squares of the odd numbers in the list and ignores the rest.
