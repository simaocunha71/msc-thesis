    public int doubleTheDifference(List<Object> lst) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (Object obj : lst) {
            if (obj instanceof Integer && (int) obj > 0) {
                sum += (int) obj * (int) obj;

This solution iterates over the list and checks if each element is an integer and is positive. If it is, it squares the integer and adds it to the sum. The sum is then returned as the result. The instanceof operator is used to check if the object is an instance of the Integer class, and the (int) cast is used to convert the object to an integer. The condition (int) obj > 0 is used to check if the integer is positive. If the input list is empty, the method will return 0 because the sum is initialized to 0. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the size of the input list, because it iterates over the list once. The space complexity is O(1), because it uses a constant amount of space to store the sum.
