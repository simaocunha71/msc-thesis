Explanation:
The problem asks to calculate the sum of squares of odd positive integers in the list. We iterate through the list and for each object, we check if it's an integer and if it's greater than 0. If it is, we square it and add it to the sum. Finally, we return the sum. 

Note that we use `instanceof` operator to check if the object is an integer and `(Integer) obj` to cast the object to an integer. We also use the ternary operator `obj > 0` to check if the integer is positive. 

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list, because we iterate through the list once. The space complexity is O(1), because we only use a constant amount of space to store the sum.
