Here is a Java solution that iterates through the list and keeps track of the maximum frequency and the corresponding integer.

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int search(List<Integer> lst) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> frequencyMap = new HashMap<>();
        int maxFrequency = 0;
        int result = -1;

        for (int num : lst) {
            frequencyMap.put(num, frequencyMap.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
            if (frequencyMap.get(num) >= num) {
                if (frequencyMap.get(num) > maxFrequency) {
                    maxFrequency = frequencyMap.get(num);
                    result = num;
                }
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

The solution uses a HashMap to store the frequency of each integer in the list. It then iterates through the list and updates the frequency map. If the frequency of an integer is greater than or equal to the integer itself, it checks if this is the maximum frequency seen so far, and updates the result accordingly. Finally, it returns the result.

For example, if the input list is [4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1], the frequency map would be {4: 1, 1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 2}. The maximum frequency is 2, and the corresponding integer is 2, so the result is 2.

If no such integer exists, the result is -1. For example, if the input list is [5, 5, 4, 4, 4], the frequency map would be {5: 2, 4: 3}. The maximum frequency is 3, but there is no integer with a frequency greater than or equal to 3, so the result is -1.
