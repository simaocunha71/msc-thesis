Explanation:
The function f takes an integer n as a parameter and returns a list of size n. The value of the element at index i is the factorial of i if i is even or the sum of numbers from 1 to i otherwise. For example, f(5) returns [1, 2, 6, 24, 15]. The program in the solution implements this function and prints the result for f(5). The output is [1, 2, 6, 24, 15].S:

This solution calculates the factorial and sum of numbers for each index i in the range [1, n]. If i is even, it calculates the factorial by multiplying numbers from 1 to i, and if i is odd, it calculates the sum by adding numbers from 1 to i. The results are stored in a list and returned. The main function tests the f function with n = 5 and prints the result. The output is [1, 2, 6, 24, 15], which is the expected result. The solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n) due to the use of a list to store the results. It is an efficient solution for calculating the factorial and sum of numbers for each index in the range [1, n].E:

Note: This solution assumes that the input n is a non-negative integer. If n is negative, the function will throw an exception. You may want to add error handling to
