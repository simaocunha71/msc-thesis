The task is to create a method that takes an integer as input and returns a list of prime numbers less than or equal to that number.

Here is the solution in Java:
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<Integer> countUpTo(int n) {
        List<Integer> primes = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
            if (isPrime(i)) {
                primes.add(i);
            }
        }
        return primes;
    }

    public boolean isPrime(int num) {
        if (num <= 1) {
            return false;
        }
        for (int i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(num); i++) {
            if (num % i == 0) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
This solution uses a helper method `isPrime` to check if a number is prime. It iterates from 2 to `n-1` and checks if each number is prime using the `isPrime` method. If a number is prime, it is added to the `primes` list.

The `isPrime` method checks if a number is prime by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number and checking if the number is divisible by any of these values. If it is, the method returns `false`. If the number is not divisible by any of these values, the method returns `true`.

The `countUpTo` method returns the `primes` list at the end. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the method returns an empty list.

You can test this solution with different inputs to see that it returns the correct list of prime numbers. For example, `countUpTo(5)` should return `[2, 3]`, and `countUpTo(20)` should return `[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]`.
