Explanation:
This problem is asking to calculate the sum of absolute values of all numbers in the array and multiply it with the product of signs of all numbers in the array. The sign of a number is 1 if it is positive, -1 if it is negative, and 0 if it is zero.

The solution provided is a Java method named `prodSigns` that takes a list of integers as input and returns an `Optional` integer. The method first checks if the input list is empty. If it is, the method returns an empty `Optional`.

Then, the method initializes two variables: `signProduct` to store the product of signs and `sumMagnitude` to store the sum of absolute values. It iterates over the input list. For each number, it checks if the number is zero. If it is, the method returns an empty `Optional` because the product of signs is undefined for an array containing zero.

If the number is not zero, the method updates `signProduct` by multiplying it with the sign of the number (1 if the number is positive, -1 if the number is negative) and updates `sumMagnitude` by adding the absolute value of the number.

Finally, the method returns an `Optional` integer that contains the product of signs and the sum of absolute values. If the input list is empty, the method returns an empty `Optional`. If the input list contains zero, the method returns an empty `Optional`. Otherwise, the method returns an `Optional` integer that contains the result.  1

Note: The problem statement is not entirely clear, but based on the examples provided, it seems that the product of signs is undefined for an array containing zero. Therefore, the method returns an empty `Optional` in this case.  1

Also, the problem statement does not specify what to do if the input list is null. In this solution, the method will throw a `NullPointerException` if the input list is null
