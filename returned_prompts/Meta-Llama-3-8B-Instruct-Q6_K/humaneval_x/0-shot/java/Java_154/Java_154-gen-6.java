The task is to check whether the second word or any of its rotations is a substring in the first word. Here is a Java solution for this problem:

```java
public boolean cycpatternCheck(String a, String b) {
    int lenA = a.length();
    int lenB = b.length();
    for (int i = 0; i < lenA; i++) {
        a = a.substring(i) + a.substring(0, i);
        if (a.contains(b)) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

In this solution, we first get the lengths of the two strings. Then we iterate over the first string and rotate it by one character each time. If any of the rotations of the first string contains the second string, we return true. If none of the rotations contain the second string, we return false. 

For example, if the input is "abcd" and "abd", the function will rotate the string "abcd" to "bcd a" and "dcba", and then check if any of these strings contains "abd". Since "abcd" contains "abd", the function will return true. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the contains method, where n is the length of the first string. If the first string is very long, this solution may be slow. 

A more efficient solution can be achieved by using the KMP algorithm, which has a time complexity of O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the two strings. However, the KMP algorithm is more complex and may be harder to understand for beginners. 

Here is an example of how you could implement the KMP algorithm in Java:

```java
public boolean cycpatternCheck(String a, String b) {
    int[] lps = new int[b.length()];
    int len = 0;
    int i = 1;
    lps[0] = 0;
    while (i < b.length()) {
        if (b.charAt(i) == b.charAt(len)) {
            len++;
            lps[i] = len;
            i++;
        } else {
            if (len != 0) {
                len = lps[len - 1];
            } else {
                lps[i] = 0;
                i++;
            }
        }
    }
    int j = 0;
    i = 0;
    while (i < a.length()) {
        if (a
