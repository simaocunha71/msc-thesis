```java

    if (a.length() < b.length()) {
        return false;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < a.length() - b.length() + 1; i++) {
        if (a.substring(i, i + b.length()).equals(b) || a.substring(i, i + b.length()).equals(b + b.substring(0, i))) {

Explanation:
The function checks if the second word (`b`) or any of its rotations is a substring in the first word (`a`). It does this by iterating through the first word and checking if the current substring of length equal to the second word is equal to the second word or its rotation.

The rotation of a string `s` is a string that can be obtained by moving the characters of `s` to the right by `k` positions, where `k` is the length of the string. For example, the rotations of the string "abc" are "abc", "bca", "cab".

The function first checks if the length of the first word is less than the length of the second word. If it is, the function returns `false` because it is not possible for the second word to be a substring of the first word.

Then, the function iterates through the first word, starting from the first character and ending at the last character minus the length of the second word plus one. For each position `i` in the first word, the function checks if the substring of length equal to the second word starting at position `i` is equal to the second word or its rotation. The rotation of the second word is obtained by concatenating the second word with the first `i` characters of the second word.

If the function finds a match, it returns `true`. If it does not find a match after checking all positions, it returns `false`.
