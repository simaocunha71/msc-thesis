The problem is asking to find the minimum number of times you need to lower the buckets to empty the wells. The buckets have a fixed capacity, and you need to fill the buckets as much as possible before lowering them.

Here is a possible solution in Java:
```
public int maxFill(List<List<Integer>> grid, int capacity) {
    int rows = grid.size();
    int cols = grid.get(0).size();
    int totalWater = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            totalWater += grid.get(i).get(j);
        }
    }
    int bucketsFilled = 0;
    while (totalWater > 0) {
        int waterFilled = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
                if (grid.get(i).get(j) > 0) {
                    int water = Math.min(capacity, grid.get(i).get(j));
                    grid.get(i).set(j, grid.get(i).get(j) - water);
                    waterFilled += water;
                }
            }
        }
        bucketsFilled++;
        totalWater -= waterFilled;
    }
    return bucketsFilled;
}
```
This solution works by first calculating the total amount of water in all the wells. Then, it iterates through the wells, filling the buckets as much as possible before lowering them. The number of times the buckets are lowered is the minimum number of times needed to empty the wells.

For example, in the first example, the total amount of water is 3. The first bucket is filled with 1 unit of water, leaving 2 units of water. The second bucket is filled with 1 unit of water, leaving 1 unit of water. The third bucket is filled with 1 unit of water, leaving 0 units of water. So, the minimum number of times needed to empty the wells is 3.

In the second example, the total amount of water is 6. The first bucket is filled with 2 units of water, leaving 4 units of water. The second bucket is filled with 2 units of water, leaving 2 units of water. The third bucket is filled with 2 units of water, leaving 0 units of water. So, the minimum number of times needed to empty the wells is
