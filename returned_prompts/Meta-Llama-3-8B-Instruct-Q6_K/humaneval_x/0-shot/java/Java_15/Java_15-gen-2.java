        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            sb.append(i).append(" ");
        }
        return sb.toString().trim();
    }
}

Explanation:
The provided Java code defines a method called `stringSequence` that generates a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 up to the given number `n` inclusive.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the method works:

1. A `StringBuilder` object `sb` is created to efficiently build the resulting string.
2. A `for` loop is used to iterate from 0 to `n` (inclusive).
3. Inside the loop, the current number `i` is appended to the `StringBuilder` object `sb` followed by a space character using the `append` method.
4. After the loop, the `toString` method is called on the `StringBuilder` object to convert it into a string.
5. Finally, the `trim` method is used to remove any trailing spaces from the resulting string.

You can test this method with different values of `n` to generate the desired output. For example, calling `stringSequence(0)` would return the string `"0"`, and calling `stringSequence(5)` would return the string `"0 1 2 3 4 5"`.
