        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            sb.append(i).append(" ");
        }
        return sb.toString().trim();
    }
}

Explanation:
The problem is asking to create a function that generates a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 up to a given number n inclusive. For example, if n is 5, the function should return the string "0 1 2 3 4 5".

The solution uses a StringBuilder to efficiently build the string. A for loop is used to iterate from 0 to n, and in each iteration, the current number is appended to the StringBuilder followed by a space. After the loop, the toString method of the StringBuilder is called to get the resulting string, and then the trim method is called to remove the trailing space.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the input number, because it iterates over the range from 0 to n. The space complexity is also O(n), because in the worst case, the resulting string can contain n+1 characters (the numbers from 0 to n, and a space between each number).  // Start writing your code here

Solution:
```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    /**
    Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.
    >>> stringSequence(0)
    "0"
    >>> stringSequence(5)
    "0 1 2 3 4 5"
     */
    public String stringSequence(int n) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            sb.append(i).append(" ");
        }
        return sb.toString().trim();
    }
}
```
