        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            sb.append(i).append(" ");
        }
        return sb.toString().trim();
    }
}

Explanation:
In this problem, we need to create a function that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 up to `n` inclusive. For example, if `n` is 5, the function should return the string "0 1 2 3 4 5".

To solve this problem, we can use a `StringBuilder` to construct the output string. We start a loop from 0 to `n`, and in each iteration, we append the current number to the `StringBuilder` followed by a space. After the loop, we use the `trim` method to remove the trailing space from the `StringBuilder` and return the resulting string.

Here is the Java code that implements this solution:
```java
public String stringSequence(int n) {
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        sb.append(i).append(" ");
    }
    return sb.toString().trim();
}
```
This code uses a `StringBuilder` to construct the output string, and the `trim` method to remove the trailing space. The `for` loop iterates from 0 to `n`, and in each iteration, it appends the current number to the `StringBuilder` followed by a space. The `toString` method is used to convert the `StringBuilder` to a string, and the `trim` method is used to remove the trailing space. The resulting string is then returned as the output.
