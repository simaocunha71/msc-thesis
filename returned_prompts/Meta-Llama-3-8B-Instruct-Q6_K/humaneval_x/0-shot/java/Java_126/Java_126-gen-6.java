The provided code is attempting to determine whether a given list of integers is sorted in ascending order. Additionally, it should return false if there are more than one duplicate of the same number in the list. Here's a possible implementation in Java:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public boolean isSorted(List<Integer> lst) {
        for (int i = 0; i < lst.size() - 1; i++) {
            if (lst.get(i) >= lst.get(i + 1)) {
                if (Collections.frequency(lst, lst.get(i)) > 1) {
                    return false;
                }
            } else {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

This solution iterates through the list, checking if each element is less than or equal to the next one. If it finds a pair where the current element is greater than or equal to the next one, it immediately returns false because the list is not sorted.

Additionally, it checks the frequency of each element in the list using the `Collections.frequency()` method. If it finds an element that appears more than once, it returns false because the list contains duplicates.

If the function completes the iteration without finding any unsorted elements or duplicates, it returns true, indicating that the list is sorted and contains no duplicates.
