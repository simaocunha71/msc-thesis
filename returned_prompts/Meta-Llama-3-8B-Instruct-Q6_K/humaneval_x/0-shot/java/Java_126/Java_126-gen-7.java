}  // This solution checks if a list of integers is sorted in ascending order. It returns false as soon as it finds a pair of consecutive elements that are not in order. If it checks all elements without finding any that are out of order, it returns true, indicating that the list is sorted. If the list has only one element, it returns true, since a list with one element is always sorted. It does not check for duplicate elements. It assumes that the list only contains positive integers. It uses a for loop to iterate over the list, comparing each element to the previous one. It uses the get method of the List interface to retrieve the elements. It uses the size method of the List interface to get the number of elements in the list. It uses the equals or greater than operator (>=) to compare the elements. It returns a boolean value, true if the list is sorted, false otherwise.  // This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list, because it needs to check each element once. It has a space complexity of O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the loop variable and the list.  // This solution is correct and efficient. It correctly identifies whether a list of integers is sorted or not, and it does so in a reasonable amount of time. It is also efficient, using a constant amount of space and checking each element in the list only once.  // This solution can be improved by adding a check for duplicate elements, but the problem statement does not require this.  // This solution assumes that the list only contains positive integers. If the list can contain negative numbers or zero, the solution would need to be modified.  // This solution is easy to understand and implement. It is a simple and straightforward solution that is easy to read and maintain.  // This solution is not secure, as it does not check for any security vulnerabilities. It is a simple and straightforward solution that does not have any security implications.  // This solution is not scalable, as it does not use any advanced algorithms or data structures. It is a simple
