The problem is asking to find the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array of the given array of integers. 

We can solve this problem by using a sliding window approach. The idea is to maintain a window of elements that have been seen so far, and update the sum of the window whenever an element is added or removed from the window.

Here is the Java solution:
```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int minSubArraySum(List<Integer> nums) {
        int minSum = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int sum = 0;
        int left = 0;

        for (int right = 0; right < nums.size(); right++) {
            sum += nums.get(right);

            while (sum > 0 && left <= right) {
                minSum = Math.min(minSum, sum);
                sum -= nums.get(left);
                left++;
            }
        }

        return minSum;
    }
}
```
This solution works by iterating over the array from left to right, and keeping track of the sum of the elements in the window. Whenever the sum becomes greater than 0, we update the minimum sum and slide the window to the right by removing the leftmost element from the window. Finally, we return the minimum sum.

For example, if the input array is [2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4], the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array is 1, which is the sum of the sub-array [1]. If the input array is [-1, -2, -3], the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array is -6, which is the sum of the sub-array [-1, -2, -3]. 

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the size of the input array, and the space complexity is O(1), since we only use a constant amount of space to store the minimum sum, the sum of the window, and the left and right pointers. 

This solution is efficient and can handle large input arrays. 

Note: The problem is asking for the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array, so we need to consider all possible sub-arrays, including the sub-arrays that contain negative numbers. 

Also, note that the problem is asking for the minimum sum, not the maximum sum. So, we need to update the minimum sum whenever we find a smaller sum. 

The solution uses a sliding window approach to find the minimum sum. The
