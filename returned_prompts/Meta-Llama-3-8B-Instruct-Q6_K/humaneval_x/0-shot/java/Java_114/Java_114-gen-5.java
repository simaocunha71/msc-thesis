E:
    The first solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) because it uses two nested loops to generate all possible subarrays. The second solution has a time complexity of O(n) because it uses a single loop to generate the subarrays and updates the current sum accordingly. The second solution is more efficient and is recommended for large inputs. 

The problem can be solved using the sliding window technique. The idea is to maintain a running sum of the elements in the array, and update the minimum sum whenever the running sum is less than the current minimum sum. If the running sum becomes positive, reset it to 0. This approach ensures that we consider all possible subarrays and find the minimum sum.

The time complexity of the second solution is O(n), where n is the size of the input array. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the current sum and the minimum sum.
