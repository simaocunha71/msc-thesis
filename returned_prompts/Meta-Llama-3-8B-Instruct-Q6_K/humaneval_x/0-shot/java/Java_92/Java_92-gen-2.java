Explanation:
The given problem is asking to create a function that takes three numbers and checks if any of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two. The function should return true if the condition is met and all numbers are integers, and false in any other cases.

In the given code, we first convert the Object type parameters x, y, and z to integer type. We then check if all the numbers are different by using the condition a != b && a != c && b != c. If this condition is not met, it means all numbers are equal, so we return false.

If all numbers are different, we then check if any of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two. We use the condition (a + b == c) || (a + c == b) || (b + c == a) to check this. If this condition is met, we return true; otherwise, we return false.

Note that we use the (int) casting to convert the Object type parameters to integer type. This is necessary because the problem statement specifies that all numbers should be integers. If the input parameters are not integers, the function will throw a ClassCastException. Therefore, it's a good practice to add error handling code to handle such situations. However, for the sake of simplicity, we have not included any error handling code in the given solution.
