Here is the correct implementation of the problem:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public boolean anyInt(Object x, Object y, Object z) {
        int a = (int) x;
        int b = (int) y;
        int c = (int) z;
        return (a == b + c) || (a == c + b) || (b == a + c) || (b == c + a) || (c == a + b) || (c == b + a);
    }
}
```

In this solution, we first cast the input objects to integers using the `(int)` keyword. Then, we check all possible combinations of the three numbers to see if any one of them is equal to the sum of the other two. If such a combination is found, we return `true`. If no such combination is found, we return `false`. 

This solution works because the problem statement requires all numbers to be integers, so we can safely cast the input objects to integers. If the input objects are not integers, the solution will throw a `ClassCastException` at runtime. 

The time complexity of this solution is O(1) because we are performing a constant number of operations, regardless of the size of the input. The space complexity is O(1) because we are using a constant amount of space to store the input numbers and the result.
