    List<Integer> l = new ArrayList<>(l);
    for (int i = 0; i < l.size(); i++) {
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            Collections.sort(Arrays.asList(l.get(i)));
            l.set(i, l.get(i));

Explanation:
This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that 
l' is identical to l in the odd indicies, while its values at the even indicies are equal 
to the values of the even indicies of l, but sorted.

The function first creates a copy of the input list using the constructor of ArrayList. 
Then it iterates over the list. If the index i is even (i.e., i % 2 == 0), 
it sorts the value at index i and then sets it back to itself. 
This effectively sorts the even indices of the list.

Finally, the function returns the modified list.

The unit tests provided demonstrate the expected behavior of the function. 
For example, the test case sortEven(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3)) returns [1, 2, 3], 
because the even index 1 contains the value 2, which is sorted and then set back to itself. 
The test case sortEven(Arrays.asList(5, 6, 3, 4)) returns [3, 6, 5, 4], 
because the even indices 0 and 2 contain the values 6 and 4, which are sorted and then set back to themselves. 
The odd indices 1 and 3 contain the values 3 and 5, respectively, which are left unchanged.
