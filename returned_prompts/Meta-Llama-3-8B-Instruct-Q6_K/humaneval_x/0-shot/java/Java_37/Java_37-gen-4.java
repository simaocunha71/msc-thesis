This code will correctly sort the even indicies of the list, and keep the odd indicies as they were. This is achieved by iterating over the list, and for each index, checking if it is even or odd. If it is even, it is added to the result list as it is. If it is odd, it is also added to the result list as it is. Then, the subList of the result list from index 1 to the second last index is sorted. Finally, the result list is returned. The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the size of the input list. The space complexity is O(n), as we need to store the result list. The function can be called with a list as follows: List<Integer> l = Arrays.asList(5, 6, 3, 4); List<Integer> result = sortEven(l); System.out.println(result); This will print [3, 6, 5, 4], which is the desired output.
