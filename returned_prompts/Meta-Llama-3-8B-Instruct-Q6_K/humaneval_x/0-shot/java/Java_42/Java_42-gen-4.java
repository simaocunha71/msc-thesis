        return l.stream()
                .map(i -> i + 1)
                .collect(Collectors.toList());
    } // end incrList

Output:
[6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124] // Expected output
Explanation: 
The function incrList is defined to increment each element of the input list l by 1. This is achieved by using Java 8's Stream API. 
The function takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list where each element is incremented by 1. 

The map function is used to apply the increment operation on each element of the list. The increment operation is defined by the lambda function i -> i + 1. 
The collect function is used to collect the results of the map operation into a new list. 
The Collectors.toList() function is used to specify that the results should be collected into a list. 
The resulting list is then returned by the function. 

This code is concise and efficient, and it avoids the need to create a new list and manually iterate over the elements of the input list. 
It is also easy to read and understand, making it a good example of how to use Java 8's Stream API to solve a problem.  //end explanation
