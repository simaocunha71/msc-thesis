The problem is asking to create a method that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list where each element is incremented by 1.

Here is the solution:
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<Integer> incrList(List<Integer> l) {
        return l.stream()
                .map(i -> i + 1)
                .collect(Collectors.toList());
    }
}
```
Explanation:

*   We use the `stream()` method to create a stream from the input list `l`.
*   We use the `map()` method to apply a transformation to each element in the stream. In this case, we increment each element by 1 using the lambda expression `i -> i + 1`.
*   We use the `collect()` method to collect the results of the transformation into a new list. We use the `Collectors.toList()` method to collect the results into a list.

This solution uses Java 8's Stream API to create a concise and efficient solution. It avoids using traditional for loops or other iterative methods, which can be less efficient and more verbose.
