        return l.stream().map(i -> i + 1).collect(Collectors.toList());

Explanation:
This code defines a class `Solution` with a method `incrList` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list where each element is incremented by 1.

The method uses the `stream()` method to create a stream from the input list. Then, it uses the `map()` method to apply a transformation to each element in the stream. In this case, the transformation is simply adding 1 to each element using the lambda expression `i -> i + 1`.

Finally, the `collect()` method is used to collect the transformed elements into a new list, which is returned as the result. The `Collectors.toList()` method is used to specify that the output should be a list.

The code is using Java 8's Stream API to achieve this. The `stream()` method is used to create a stream from the input list, and then the `map()` method is used to transform each element in the stream. The `collect()` method is used to collect the transformed elements into a new list. The `Collectors.toList()` method is used to specify that the output should be a list. This is a concise and efficient way to perform the desired operation.
