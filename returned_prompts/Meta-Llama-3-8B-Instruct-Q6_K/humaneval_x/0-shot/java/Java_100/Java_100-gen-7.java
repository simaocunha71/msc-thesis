R:
The function makeAPile is used to create a pile of n levels of stones.
The function starts by adding n stones to the pile.
Then it enters a loop where it calculates the number of stones for the next level.
The number of stones for the next level is determined by whether the previous level had an odd or even number of stones.
If the previous level had an odd number of stones, the next level will have one more stone.
If the previous level had an even number of stones, the next level will have one less stone.
The loop continues until there are no more stones in the pile.
The function returns a list of the number of stones in each level.

The time complexity of the function is O(log n) because the number of stones in each level is halved in each iteration.
The space complexity is O(n) because the function returns a list of n elements.

Here is the unit test:
```
assert makeAPile(3).equals([3, 5, 7])
assert makeAPile(4).equals([4, 6, 6, 6])
assert makeAPile(5).equals([5, 7, 7, 7, 7])
```  C++ Solution:
```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<int> makeAPile(int n) {
    vector<int> result;
    if (n <= 0) {
        return result;
    }
    result.push_back(n);
    int prev = n;
    while (prev > 0) {
        if (prev % 2 == 0) {
            prev = prev + 1;
        } else {
            prev = prev - 1;
        }
        result.insert(result.begin(), prev);
        prev = prev / 2;
    }
    return result;
}
```
This C++ solution is similar to the Python solution. It uses a vector to store the number of stones in each level and iterates until there are no more stones in
