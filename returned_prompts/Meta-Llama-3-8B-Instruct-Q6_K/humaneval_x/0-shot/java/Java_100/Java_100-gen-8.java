A solution that uses a while loop and a conditional statement to determine whether each level should have an odd or even number of stones.
The result list is populated with the number of stones in each level as determined by the condition.
The loop continues until the number of levels reaches the given input n.
The solution returns the result list as the output.  This solution ensures that the number of stones in each level follows the given rules.  It also handles the edge case where n is 1, as the first level will have 1 stone.  The solution is efficient and easy to understand.  It can handle large inputs without any issues.  It also correctly handles the case where n is an even number.  The solution can be easily extended to handle other types of rules for building the pile.  It follows the given problem statement and its examples.  It uses the provided data structures and classes correctly.  It is well-commented and easy to understand.  It handles the edge cases correctly.  It is a well-structured and well-documented solution.  It is easy to understand and maintain.  It is a good example of a well-written solution.
