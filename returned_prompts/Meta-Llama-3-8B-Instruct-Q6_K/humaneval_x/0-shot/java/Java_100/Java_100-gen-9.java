The problem is asking to create a pile of stones with n levels.
Each level has a certain number of stones, and the number of stones in the next level
is determined by whether the previous level has an odd or even number of stones.

The solution uses a while loop to calculate the number of stones in each level.
The number of stones in the next level is determined by whether the current level has
an odd or even number of stones. If the current level has an even number of stones,
the next level will have the next odd number of stones. If the current level has an
odd number of stones, the next level will have the next even number of stones.

The result is a list of integers representing the number of stones in each level,
where the element at index i represents the number of stones in the level (i+1).
The list is reversed at the end to get the correct order.

For example, if n is 3, the output will be [3, 5, 7], which represents the number
of stones in each level of the pile. The first level has 3 stones, the second level
has 5 stones, and the third level has 7 stones.
