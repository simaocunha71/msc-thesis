R:
The function `makeAPile` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of integers representing the number of stones in each level of the pile. The list is constructed by iterating over the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive). For each iteration, the number of stones in the current level is calculated based on whether the current level number `i` is even or odd. If `i` is even, the number of stones is `i * 2`, otherwise it is `i * 2 + 1`. The calculated number of stones is then added to the result list. Finally, the list is returned.

Note that the function uses the modulo operator (`%`) to determine whether `i` is even or odd. If `i` is even, the remainder of the division of `i` by 2 is 0, and if `i` is odd, the remainder is 1. The function uses this property to decide whether to add `i * 2` or `i * 2 + 1` to the result list.
