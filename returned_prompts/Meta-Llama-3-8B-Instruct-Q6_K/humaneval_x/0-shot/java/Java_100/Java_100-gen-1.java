Explanation:
The problem is asking to create a pile of stones with n levels. The number of stones in each level is determined by the parity of the previous level. If the previous level has an odd number of stones, the next level should have the next odd number of stones. If the previous level has an even number of stones, the next level should have the next even number of stones.

We can solve this problem by using a while loop to iterate through each level of the pile. We initialize the list to store the number of stones in each level and the current level and stones. In each iteration, we check if the number of stones in the current level is even or odd. If it's even, we add the current number of stones to the list and update the number of stones for the next level by dividing the current number of stones by 2 and adding 1. If it's odd, we add the current number of stones to the list and update the number of stones for the next level by subtracting 1 from the current number of stones and dividing the result by 2, then add 1. We increment the level after each iteration.

Finally, we return the list of stones in each level. The list is in the order of the levels, where the element at index i represents the number of stones in the level (i+1). For example, if the input is 3, the output will be [3, 5, 7], which means the first level has 3 stones, the second level has 5 stones, and the third level has 7 stones.
