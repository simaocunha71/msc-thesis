    List<Integer> pile = new ArrayList<>();
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            pile.add(i * 2);
        } else {
            pile.add(i * 2 - 1);
        }

Explanation:
This problem is about creating a pile of stones with n levels. The number of stones in each level follows a specific pattern. If the current level number (i) is even, the number of stones in that level is the next even number, which is i * 2. If the current level number is odd, the number of stones in that level is the next odd number, which is i * 2 - 1. We use a list to store the number of stones in each level and return this list.

In the given code, we iterate from 1 to n (inclusive) and check if the current level number is even or odd. If it's even, we add i * 2 to the pile list. If it's odd, we add i * 2 - 1 to the pile list. Finally, we return the pile list. For example, if n is 3, the output will be [3, 5, 7], which represents the number of stones in each level of the pile.
