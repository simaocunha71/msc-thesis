The task is to find the closest pair of numbers in a given list of numbers. The numbers should be returned in order, with the smaller number first and the larger number second.

Here is a Java solution using the Java Collections Framework:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<Double> findClosestElements(List<Double> numbers) {
        if (numbers.size() < 2) {
            throw new RuntimeException("List must contain at least two elements");
        }

        double minDiff = Double.MAX_VALUE;
        List<Double> closestPair = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < numbers.size(); j++) {
                double diff = Math.abs(numbers.get(i) - numbers.get(j));
                if (diff < minDiff) {
                    minDiff = diff;
                    closestPair.clear();
                    closestPair.add(numbers.get(i));
                    closestPair.add(numbers.get(j));
                } else if (diff == minDiff) {
                    closestPair.add(numbers.get(i));
                    closestPair.add(numbers.get(j));
                }
            }
        }

        Collections.sort(closestPair);
        return closestPair;
    }
}
```

In this solution, we first check if the list contains at least two elements. Then, we iterate over all pairs of numbers in the list, calculating the absolute difference between each pair. If we find a pair with a smaller difference, we update the minimum difference and reset the closest pair list. If we find a pair with the same minimum difference, we add it to the closest pair list. Finally, we sort the closest pair list and return it.

Note that this solution has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the size of the input list. This may not be efficient for large lists. A more efficient solution using a priority queue or a balanced binary search tree could be implemented, but it would be more complex.
