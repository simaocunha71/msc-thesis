```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<Double> findClosestElements(List<Double> numbers) {
        double minDiff = Double.MAX_VALUE;
        List<Double> closestElements = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < numbers.size(); j++) {
                double diff = Math.abs(numbers.get(j) - numbers.get(i));
                if (diff < minDiff) {
                    minDiff = diff;
                    closestElements.clear();
                    closestElements.add(numbers.get(i));
                    closestElements.add(numbers.get(j));
                }
            }
        }
        return closestElements;
    }
}
```
The code first initializes a variable `minDiff` to a large value and an empty list `closestElements`. It then iterates over the list of numbers using two nested loops. For each pair of numbers, it calculates the absolute difference between them and checks if it's smaller than the current minimum difference. If it is, it updates the minimum difference and resets the `closestElements` list to contain the current pair of numbers. Finally, it returns the `closestElements` list. 

Please note that this solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) where n is the size of the input list, because it uses two nested loops to compare all pairs of numbers. This might be inefficient for large input lists. A more efficient solution would be to use a data structure like a sorted list or a binary search tree to find the closest elements in O(n log n) time. 

For example, you could use a sorted list and then find the closest elements by iterating over the list and keeping track of the minimum difference and the closest elements. This would be more efficient than the current solution. 

Here is an example of how you could implement this:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<Double> findClosestElements(List<Double> numbers) {
        Collections.sort(numbers);
        double minDiff = Double.MAX_VALUE;
        List<Double> closestElements = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size() - 1; i++) {
            double diff = Math.abs(numbers.get(i + 1) - numbers.get(i));
            if (diff < minDiff) {
                minDiff = diff;
                closestElements.clear();
                closestElements.add(numbers.get(i));
                closestElements.add(numbers.get(i + 1));
            }
        }
