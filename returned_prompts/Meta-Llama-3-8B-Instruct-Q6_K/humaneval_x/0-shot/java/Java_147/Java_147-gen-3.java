The given problem is a classic example of the Three Sum Problem, where we need to find the number of triples in an array that sum up to a multiple of 3. The time complexity of this solution is O(n^3) because we are using three nested loops to iterate through the array.

However, we can optimize this solution by using a hashmap to store the values of the array and their frequencies. This way, we can reduce the time complexity to O(n^2).

Here's the optimized solution:

```java
public int getMaxTriples(int n) {
    int count = 0;
    int[] a = new int[n];
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        a[i - 1] = i * i - i + 1;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            int sum = a[i] + a[j];
            if (a[n - 1] % 3 == 0) {
                if ((sum % 3 == 0) && (n - 1) - i - j > 0) {
                    count++;
                }
            } else {
                int remainder = a[n - 1] % 3;
                if ((sum % 3 == remainder) && (n - 1) - i - j > 0) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

This solution works by iterating through the array and calculating the sum of each pair of elements. If the sum is a multiple of 3, we check if the remaining element (a[n - 1]) is also a multiple of 3. If it is, we increment the count. If the remaining element is not a multiple of 3, we check if the sum
