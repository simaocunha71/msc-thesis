Solution explanation:
The problem is asking to find the number of triples (a[i], a[j], a[k]) where i < j < k, and a[i] + a[j] + a[k] is a multiple of 3. 

The solution is to create an array a of length n where a[i] = i * i - i + 1. Then for each triple (a[i], a[j], a[k]) where i < j < k, check if a[i] + a[j] + a[k] is a multiple of 3. If it is, increment the count.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^3) because there are three nested loops. The space complexity is O(n) for the array a. 

In the given example, n = 5. The array a is [1, 3, 7, 13, 21]. The only valid triple is (1, 7, 13) because 1 + 7 + 13 is a multiple of 3. Therefore, the output is 1. 

Note: The problem can be solved more efficiently by using a hash map to store the sum of a[i] and a[j] and then check if the sum is a multiple of 3. This approach reduces the time complexity to O(n^2). However, the solution provided is a brute force solution and is simple to understand.
