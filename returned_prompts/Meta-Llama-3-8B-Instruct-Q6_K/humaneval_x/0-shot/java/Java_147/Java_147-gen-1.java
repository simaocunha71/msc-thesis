The problem can be solved by iterating over the array and checking for the condition where a[i] + a[j] + a[k] is a multiple of 3.
Here is the Java code for the problem:
```java
public int getMaxTriples(int n) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            for (int k = j + 1; k <= n; k++) {
                if ((a[i] + a[j] + a[k]) % 3 == 0) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```
The time complexity of this solution is O(n^3) because we are using three nested loops to iterate over the array. The space complexity is O(1) because we are not using any additional space that scales with the input size.

The code is also quite straightforward to read and understand, and it is easy to modify it to solve similar problems. For example, if we wanted to find the number of quadruples (a[i], a[j], a[k], a[l]) where i < j < k < l, we could simply add another loop and modify the condition in the if statement.

However, this solution is not very efficient for large values of n because the time complexity is cubic. We could improve the efficiency by using a more efficient algorithm or data structure, such as a hash table or a sieve, to store the values of a[i] and then iterate over the array only once to find the triples. But for small values of n, this solution is sufficient.
