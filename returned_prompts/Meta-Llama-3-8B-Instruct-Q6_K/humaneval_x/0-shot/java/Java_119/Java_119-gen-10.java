Explanation:
The problem is asking to check if it is possible to concatenate the two strings in some order, that the resulting string will be good. A string S is considered to be good if and only if all parentheses in S are balanced. We can achieve this by using a stack (implemented as a StringBuilder in this case) to keep track of the open parentheses. Whenever we encounter a close parenthesis, we check if the stack is empty or the top of the stack is not an open parenthesis. If this condition is met, we return "No". If we can successfully concatenate the strings without returning "No", we return "Yes". If the stack is empty at the end, it means all parentheses were balanced, so we return "Yes". Otherwise, we return "No". 

The time complexity is O(n), where n is the total length of the two strings. The space complexity is O(n) for the stack. 

The unit test case "matchParens(Arrays.asList("()(", ")")) == "Yes"" is a correct test case because we can concatenate the strings in some order to get a good string. The test case "matchParens(Arrays.asList(")", ")")) == "No"" is also a correct test case because it is impossible to concatenate the strings in some order to get a good string.
