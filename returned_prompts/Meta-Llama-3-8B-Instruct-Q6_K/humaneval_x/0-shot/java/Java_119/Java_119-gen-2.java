    //Explanation: 
    //The idea is to count the number of open and close parentheses in the given list of strings. 
    //If the number of open parentheses equals the number of close parentheses, then we can concatenate the strings in some order to form a good string.
    //For example, if we have two strings "()" and ")(", we can concatenate them to form "(())()". This string is good because all parentheses are balanced.
    //On the other hand, if the number of open parentheses does not equal the number of close parentheses, then we cannot concatenate the strings to form a good string.
    //For example, if we have two strings ")", ")", we cannot concatenate them to form a good string.
    //Therefore, we return "Yes" if the number of open parentheses equals the number of close parentheses, and "No" otherwise. 

    //Time complexity: O(n), where n is the total number of characters in the given list of strings.
    //Space complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the counts of open and close parentheses. 

    //Note: This solution assumes that the input list of strings does not contain any characters other than open and close parentheses. If the input list can contain other characters, then we need to modify the solution accordingly. 

    //Also, this solution assumes that the input list of strings is not null. If the input list can be null, then we need to add a null check at the beginning of the method. 

    //Finally, this solution returns a string "Yes" or "No" as per the problem statement. If the problem statement is modified to return a boolean value instead, then we can modify the solution accordingly.

The provided solution counts the number of open and close parentheses in the given list of strings. If the number of open parentheses equals the number of close parentheses, it returns "Yes", indicating that it is possible to concatenate the strings to form a good string
