The derivative of a polynomial is obtained by differentiating each term with respect to x and reducing the power of x by 1. For example, if we have a polynomial 3x^3 + 2x^2 + x + 1, its derivative will be 9x^2 + 4x + 1.

In the given code, we can use the following algorithm to calculate the derivative of a polynomial. We start from the end of the list and multiply each term with its coefficient by the power of x it represents, and then subtract the power by 1. We add all these terms to a new list and return it.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
public List<Integer> derivative(List<Integer> xs) {
    List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
    for (int i = 1; i < xs.size(); i++) {
        result.add(xs.get(i) * i);
    }
    return result;
}
```

This code works by iterating over the list of coefficients from the second element to the end (inclusive). For each element, it calculates the derivative term by multiplying the coefficient with its index (which represents the power of x) and adds it to the result list. Finally, it returns the result list.
