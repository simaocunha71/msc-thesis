The problem is asking to find the derivative of a polynomial represented by a list of coefficients. The derivative of a polynomial is obtained by differentiating each term and multiplying the coefficient by the degree of the term.

Here is the solution in Java:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<Integer> derivative(List<Integer> xs) {
        List<Integer> derivative = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 1; i < xs.size(); i++) {
            derivative.add(xs.get(i) * i);
        }
        return derivative;
    }
}
```

In this solution, we iterate through the list of coefficients starting from the second element (index 1). For each element, we multiply it by its index (which represents the degree of the term) and add the result to the list of derivatives. The resulting list represents the derivative of the polynomial.

For example, if the input is `[3, 1, 2, 4, 5]`, the output will be `[1, 4, 12, 20]`, which is the derivative of the polynomial `3 + x + 2x^2 + 4x^3 + 5x^4`.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of coefficients in the input list. The space complexity is also O(n), as we need to store the result in a new list.
