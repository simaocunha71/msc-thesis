    The problem is asking to find the number of collisions between two sets of cars moving in opposite directions on an infinite road. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they do not stop or change direction after a collision.

    The problem can be solved by using the concept of modulo operation. The idea is to consider the road as a circle, where the left-moving cars will meet the right-moving cars again after a certain distance.

    In this problem, the distance covered by a car in one unit of time is equal to the number of cars. So, the distance covered by a car in one unit of time is equal to the number of cars.

    The time taken by a car to cover the distance equal to the number of cars is equal to the number of cars.

    So, the number of collisions between two sets of cars is equal to the number of cars divided by the number of cars.

    The formula to calculate the number of collisions is:

    collisions = n / n = 1

    So, the output of the function is 1.

    Here is the Java code to solve the problem:

    ```java
    public int carRaceCollision(int n) {
        return 1;
    }
    ```

    This code simply returns 1, which is the number of collisions between two sets of cars. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they do not stop or change direction after a collision, and the number of collisions is always 1.
