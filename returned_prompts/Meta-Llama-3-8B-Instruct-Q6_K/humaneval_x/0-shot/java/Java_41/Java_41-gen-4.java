The problem is describing a road where two sets of cars are moving in opposite directions at the same speed. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they don't stop or change direction after a collision. The task is to find the number of collisions that occur between the two sets of cars.

The problem can be solved by using a mathematical approach. The key insight is that the number of collisions is equal to the number of pairs of cars that are initially at the same position on the road. This is because each collision is unique, and there are no repeated collisions.

The formula for the number of pairs of cars that are initially at the same position is given by the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers, which is n*(n+1)/2.

So, the solution is:
```java
public int carRaceCollision(int n) {
    return n * (n + 1) / 2;
}
```
This solution has a time complexity of O(1) because it only involves a constant number of operations, regardless of the input size. The space complexity is also O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the result.
