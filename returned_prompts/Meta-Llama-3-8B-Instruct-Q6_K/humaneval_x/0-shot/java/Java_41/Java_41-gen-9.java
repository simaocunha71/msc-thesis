The problem is asking to calculate the number of collisions between two sets of cars moving in opposite directions. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they will continue moving in their trajectory after a collision.

Here is the solution:

```java
public int carRaceCollision(int n) {
    return n;
}
```

The solution is that all n cars from both directions will collide with each other, so the number of collisions is n.

Explanation: 
In this problem, the cars are moving in opposite directions, so each car from one direction will collide with a car from the other direction. Since the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, they will continue moving in their trajectory after a collision. Therefore, all n cars from both directions will collide with each other, resulting in n collisions. This is the only possible outcome, as each car will collide with another car. 

This problem can be solved by simply returning n, as this is the number of collisions that will occur. 

Note: This solution assumes that the cars are moving at the same speed and that the collision does not affect the trajectory of the cars. This is stated in the problem description. 

This problem is a classic example of a problem that requires careful reading and understanding of the problem description. The solution may seem simple, but it requires a deep understanding of the problem and the assumptions made in the problem description.
