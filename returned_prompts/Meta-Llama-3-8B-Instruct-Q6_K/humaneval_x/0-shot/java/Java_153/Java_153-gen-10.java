Here is a Java solution using Java 8 Stream API:

```java
public String StrongestExtension(String class_name, List<String> extensions) {
    return extensions.stream()
            .map(extension -> new Pair(extension, extension.chars().filter(c -> Character.isUpperCase(c)).count() - extension.chars().filter(c -> Character.isLowerCase(c)).count()))
            .max(Comparator.comparingInt(Pair::getStrength))
            .map(pair -> class_name + "." + pair.getKey())
            .orElse("No extensions available");
}

class Pair {
    private String key;
    private int strength;

    public Pair(String key, int strength) {
        this.key = key;
        this.strength = strength;
    }

    public int getStrength() {
        return strength;
    }

    public String getKey() {
        return key;
    }
}
```

This solution works as follows:

- It uses Stream API to process the list of extensions.
- For each extension, it calculates the strength by subtracting the number of lowercase letters from the number of uppercase letters.
- It uses `max` method to find the extension with the maximum strength.
- If there are multiple extensions with the same maximum strength, it returns the first one in the list.
- Finally, it returns the class name followed by the strongest extension name, or "No extensions available" if the list is empty.

This solution is concise and efficient, and it uses Java 8 Stream API to process the list of extensions in a functional programming style. 

Note that this solution assumes that the list of extensions is not empty. If the list can be empty, you should add a check for that and return a suitable default value (e.g., "No extensions available"). 

Also, this solution uses a custom `Pair` class to store the extension name and its strength. This is done to simplify the code and make it easier to understand. However, you could also achieve the same result without using a custom class, by using a lambda expression or a method reference to extract the strength from the extension name. 

Finally, this solution uses `chars` method to iterate over the characters of the extension name, and `filter` method to count the number of uppercase and lowercase letters. This is done to make the code concise and efficient. However, you could also achieve the same result by using a loop to iterate over the characters of the extension name and counting the number of uppercase and lowercase letters manually.
