    return x + y;
    }

Explanation:
This Java class provides a simple method called `add` that takes two integers as parameters and returns their sum. The method is defined inside a class named `Solution`. The method signature is `public int add(int x, int y)`, which means it is a public method that takes two integer parameters and returns an integer. The method simply adds the two numbers together and returns the result.

The `>>>` symbols in the comments are used to represent the expected output of the `add` method. For example, `>>> add(2, 3)` is expected to return `5`, and `>>> add(5, 7)` is expected to return `12`. These comments are used to document the expected behavior of the `add` method.

Note that this is a very simple implementation of a method that adds two numbers together. In a real-world scenario, you might want to add error checking or handling for invalid input, but for the purposes of this example, this implementation is sufficient.
