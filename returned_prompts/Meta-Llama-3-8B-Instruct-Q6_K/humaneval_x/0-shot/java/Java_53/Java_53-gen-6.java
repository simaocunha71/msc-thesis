Explanation:
The code defines a simple class `Solution` with a single method `add(int x, int y)` that takes two integers `x` and `y` as input and returns their sum.

The method `add` is implemented using the standard arithmetic operation of addition, where `x` and `y` are added together and the result is returned.

The comments provided explain the purpose of the code and demonstrate how the method can be used to add different pairs of numbers. The output of the code is the sum of the input numbers. For example, calling `add(2, 3)` would return `5`, and calling `add(5, 7)` would return `12`.
