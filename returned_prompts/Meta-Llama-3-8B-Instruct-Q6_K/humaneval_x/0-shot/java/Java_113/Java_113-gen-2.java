Here is the solution:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<String> oddCount(List<String> lst) {
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (String s : lst) {
            int count = 0;
            for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
                if ((c - '0') % 2 != 0) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
            result.add("the number of odd elements " + count + " in the str" + s.length() + "ng " + s.length() + " of the " + s.length() + "nput.");
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

Explanation:
This solution iterates over each string in the input list. For each string, it counts the number of odd digits by iterating over each character in the string and checking if the character is odd (by subtracting the ASCII value of '0' from the character and checking if the result is odd). The count is then added to the result list as a string in the desired format. The `toCharArray()` method is used to convert the string to an array of characters, and the `length()` method is used to get the length of the string. The `ArrayList<String>` class is used to store the results. The method returns the result list.
