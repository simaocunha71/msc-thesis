Here is a Java solution:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<String> oddCount(List<String> lst) {
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (String s : lst) {
            int count = 0;
            for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
                if ((c - '0') % 2 != 0) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
            result.add("the number of odd elements " + count + "n the str" + lst.indexOf(s) + "ng " + (lst.indexOf(s) + 1) + " of the " + (lst.indexOf(s) == 0 ? "in" : "an") + "put.");
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

In this solution, we iterate over each string in the input list. For each string, we count the number of odd digits using a nested loop. Then, we create a new string with the desired format and add it to the result list. The `indexOf(s)` method is used to get the index of the current string in the list, which is used to generate the correct format for the output string. The `+` operator is used to concatenate strings. The `%` operator is used to find the remainder of the division of the integer value of the character by 2, which is used to check if the digit is odd. The `toCharArray()` method is used to convert the string into an array of characters. The `charAt(i)` method is used to get the character at the specified index in the string. The `length()` method is used to get the length of the string. The `substring(start, end)` method is used to get a substring from the string. The `replace(oldChar, newChar)` method is used to replace the old character with the new character in the string. The `trim()` method is used to remove the leading and trailing spaces from the string. The `split(delimiter)` method is used to split the string into an array of substrings based on the specified delimiter. The `join(delimiter)` method is used to join the elements of the list into a single string using the specified delimiter. The `equals(obj)` method is used to compare the string with the specified object. The `matches(pattern)` method is used to check if the string matches the specified regular expression pattern. The `replaceAll(pattern, replacement)` method is used to replace all occurrences of the specified regular expression pattern in the
