    public List<Integer> sortThird(List<Integer> l) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < l.size(); i++) {
            if (i % 3 == 0) {
                result.add(sort(l.subList(i, i + 1)).get(0));
            } else {
                result.add(l.get(i));
            }
        }
        return result;
    }

    public List<Integer> sort(List<Integer> l) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>(l);
        Collections.sort(result);
        return result;

Here, we are creating a new list and populating it with the values from the original list. However, if the index of the value is divisible by 3, we sort the value and add it to the new list. If the index is not divisible by 3, we just add the value as it is. The sort function is a helper function that sorts the list of integers. 

This function works by iterating over the list and checking if the index of the value is divisible by 3. If it is, it sorts the value and adds it to the new list. If it is not, it just adds the value as it is. This results in a new list where the values at the indices that are divisible by 3 are sorted, while the values at the other indices remain the same. 

The sort function is a helper function that sorts the list of integers. It creates a copy of the list, sorts it, and then returns the sorted list. This is because the sort function in Java does not modify the original list, it returns a new sorted list. 

This function can be further optimized by using Java 8's stream API, which can simplify the code and make it more readable. Here is an example of how the function could be rewritten using the stream API:

```java
public List<Integer> sortThird(List<Integer> l) {
    return IntStream.range(0, l.size())
            .boxed()
            .collect(Collectors.toList())
            .stream()
            .map(i -> i % 3 == 0 ? Collections.sort(Arrays.asList(l.get(i))).get(0) : l.get(i))
            .collect(Collectors.toList());
}
```

This version of the function is more concise and easier to read, but it has the same effect as the original function. It uses the IntStream.range function to create a stream of indices, and then uses the map function to transform
