Explanation:
The task is to create a new list where all elements at indices that are divisible by 3 are sorted, and the rest of the elements remain unchanged.

In the given code, we iterate over the input list `l`. For each index `i`, we check if `i` is divisible by 3 (using the modulus operator `%`). If it is, we sort the element at that index using `Collections.sort` and add it to the result list. If `i` is not divisible by 3, we simply add the original element to the result list.

Note that `Arrays.asList(l.get(i))` is used to create a list containing only the element at index `i`, which is then sorted. This is necessary because `Collections.sort` sorts the entire list, not just a single element. By wrapping the element in a list, we can pass it to `Collections.sort`. The sorted list is then added to the result list.
