Explanation:
The code first splits the input string into individual words using the `split()` method with a space character as the separator. Then, it iterates over each word and updates the histogram map accordingly. The `histogram` map is used to store the frequency of each word, with the word as the key and the frequency as the value.

After updating the histogram, the code finds the maximum frequency by iterating over the `histogram` map and keeping track of the maximum frequency.

Finally, the code creates a new map, `result`, to store the words with the maximum frequency. It iterates over the `histogram` map again and adds each word with the maximum frequency to the `result` map. The `result` map is then returned.

The code uses a `HashMap` to store the histogram, which provides efficient lookups and updates. The `split()` method is used to split the input string into individual words, and the `entrySet()` method is used to iterate over the `histogram` map and find the maximum frequency. The `put()` method is used to update the `histogram` map, and the `get()` method is used to retrieve the frequency of a word. The `equals()` method is used to compare the frequency of different words. The `containsKey()` method is used to check if a word is already present in the `histogram` map. The `size()` method is used to get the size of the `histogram` map. The `isEmpty()` method is used to check if the `histogram` map is empty. The `
