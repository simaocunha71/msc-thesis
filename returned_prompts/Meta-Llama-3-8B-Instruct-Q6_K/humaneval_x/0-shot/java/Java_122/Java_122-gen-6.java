The problem asks to calculate the sum of elements with at most two digits from the first k elements of the given array. 

Here is a simple Java solution using a loop:

```java
public int addElements(List<Integer> arr, int k) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        if (String.valueOf(arr.get(i)).length() <= 2) {
            sum += arr.get(i);
        }
    }
    return sum;
}
```

In this solution, we iterate over the first k elements of the array. For each element, we convert it to a string and check its length. If the length is less than or equal to 2, it means the element has at most two digits, so we add it to the sum. Finally, we return the sum.

This solution has a time complexity of O(k), where k is the number of elements to be considered. This is because we need to iterate over the first k elements of the array. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the sum. 

Please note that the problem statement does not specify whether the array contains only positive integers or not. However, in this solution, we do not make any assumption about the sign of the elements. The solution works correctly for arrays containing both positive and negative integers. 

Also, the problem statement does not specify whether the array contains non-integer elements or not. However, in this solution, we assume that the array contains only integers. If the array can contain non-integer elements, then we need to add a check to handle those elements correctly. 

Finally, the problem statement does not specify whether the array is sorted or not. However, in this solution, we do not make any assumption about the order of the elements in the array. The solution works correctly for arrays in any order. 

If the array is sorted, then we can use a more efficient solution that uses a binary search to find the first element with more than two digits. This would reduce the time complexity of the solution from O(k) to O(log k). However, this would also make the solution more complex and harder to understand. 

In summary, this solution is simple, efficient, and easy to understand, but it assumes that the array contains only positive integers and is not sorted. If these assumptions are not valid, then we need to modify the solution accordingly.
