Here is the Java solution for the problem:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int atMostTwoDigitsSum(List<Integer> arr, int k) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            if (String.valueOf(arr.get(i)).length() <= 2) {
                sum += arr.get(i);
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

Explanation:

1.  We iterate over the first `k` elements of the array.
2.  For each element, we convert it to a string and check its length.
3.  If the length is less than or equal to 2 (i.e., the element has at most two digits), we add it to the sum.
4.  Finally, we return the sum.

Example usage:

```java
List<Integer> arr = Arrays.asList(111, 21, 3, 4000, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9);
int k = 4;
Solution solution = new Solution();
int result = solution.atMostTwoDigitsSum(arr, k);
System.out.println(result);  // Output: 24
```


This solution has a time complexity of O(k), where k is the number of elements to process, because we only iterate over the first k elements of the array. The space complexity is O(1), because we only use a constant amount of space to store the sum and the current element.
