Here is a Java solution that uses a Stream API to filter the elements with at most two digits and then sums them up:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int atMostTwoDigits(List<Integer> arr, int k) {
        return arr.stream()
                .limit(k)
                .filter(x -> String.valueOf(x).length() <= 2)
                .mapToInt(Integer::intValue)
                .sum();
    }
}
```

In this solution, `arr.stream()` creates a Stream from the list of integers. `limit(k)` limits the stream to the first k elements. `filter(x -> String.valueOf(x).length() <= 2)` filters the stream to include only elements with at most two digits. `mapToInt(Integer::intValue)` converts the stream of integers to an IntStream, and `sum()` calculates the sum of the elements in the stream.

This solution has a time complexity of O(k), where k is the input parameter, because it needs to iterate over the first k elements of the array. The space complexity is O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the result.
