```java
public int addElements(List<Integer> arr, int k) {
    int sum = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        int num = arr.get(i);
        if(String.valueOf(num).length() <= 2) {
            sum += num;
        }
    }
    return sum;
}
```



Explanation:

1. We initialize a variable `sum` to store the sum of the elements with at most two digits.

2. We loop through the first `k` elements of the array using a for loop.

3. For each element, we convert it to a string using `String.valueOf(num)` to check the length of the string representation of the number.

4. If the length of the string representation of the number is less than or equal to 2, it means the number has at most two digits, so we add it to the sum.

5. Finally, we return the sum.

This solution has a time complexity of O(k) where k is the input parameter, as we are iterating through the first k elements of the array. The space complexity is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of space to store the sum.
