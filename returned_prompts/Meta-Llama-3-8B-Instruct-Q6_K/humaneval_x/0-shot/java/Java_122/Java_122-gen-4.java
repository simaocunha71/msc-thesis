```java
public int atMostKDigits(List<Integer> arr, int k) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        int num = arr.get(i);
        if (String.valueOf(num).length() <= 2) {
            sum += num;
        } else {
            break;
        }
    }
    return sum;
}
```
Explanation:
The problem requires us to find the sum of the elements in the first k elements of the array that have at most two digits. 

We can achieve this by iterating over the array and checking the length of the string representation of each number. If the length is less than or equal to 2, we add the number to the sum. If the length is more than 2, we break the loop as we have already processed the required number of elements. 

In the given example, the array is [111,21,3,4000,5,6,7,8,9] and k is 4. The numbers 21 and 3 have at most two digits, so the sum is 24. 

The time complexity of this solution is O(k) as we are iterating over the array at most k times. The space complexity is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of space to store the sum.
