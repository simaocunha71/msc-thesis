Here is the solution in Java:

```java
public int atMostTwoDigits(int[] arr, int k) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        if (String.valueOf(arr[i]).length() <= 2) {
            sum += arr[i];
        } else {
            break;
        }
    }
    return sum;
}
```

Explanation:
This solution iterates over the first `k` elements of the array. For each element, it checks if the element has at most two digits by converting it to a string and checking its length. If the length is less than or equal to 2, it adds the element to the sum. If the length is greater than 2, it breaks out of the loop and returns the sum. This ensures that we only consider elements with at most two digits in the sum.

This solution has a time complexity of O(k), where `k` is the input parameter. This is because we iterate over the first `k` elements of the array at most once. The space complexity is O(1), which means the space required does not change with the size of the input array, because we only use a constant amount of space to store the sum and the loop variable.
