The problem is asking to create a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string where all the words in the input string are replaced by a new word where all the characters are arranged in ascending order based on ASCII values. The order of words and blank spaces in the sentence should be preserved.

Here is the solution:

```java
public String antiShuffle(String s) {
    String[] words = s.split(" ");
    StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();

    for (String word : words) {
        char[] chars = word.toCharArray();
        Arrays.sort(chars);
        result.append(new String(chars)).append(" ");
    }

    return result.toString().trim();
}
```

In this solution, we first split the input string into words using the `split` method. Then, for each word, we convert it to a character array, sort the array using the `Arrays.sort` method, and then create a new string from the sorted array using the `String` constructor. We append this new string to the result string builder, followed by a space. Finally, we return the result string after trimming any trailing spaces using the `trim` method.
