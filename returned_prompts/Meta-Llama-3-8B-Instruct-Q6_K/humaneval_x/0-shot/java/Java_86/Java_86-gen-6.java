The task is to create a function that rearranges a given string by sorting the characters in each word in ascending order based on their ASCII values. The order of words and blank spaces should remain the same.

Here's a Java solution for the problem:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public String antiShuffle(String s) {
        String[] words = s.split(" ");
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();

        for (String word : words) {
            char[] arr = word.toCharArray();
            Arrays.sort(arr);
            result.append(new String(arr)).append(" ");
        }

        return result.toString().trim();
    }
}
```

In this solution, we first split the input string into an array of words using the `split` method. Then, we iterate over each word, convert it into a character array, sort it using the `Arrays.sort` method, and finally join the sorted characters back into a string using the `String` constructor. We append each word to a `StringBuilder` object, which we use to build the final result string. Finally, we trim the result string by removing any trailing spaces using the `trim` method.

Here's how you can test the solution:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        System.out.println(solution.antiShuffle("Hi")); // Output: "Hi"
        System.out.println(solution.antiShuffle("hello")); // Output: "ehllo"
        System.out.println(solution.antiShuffle("Hello World!!!")); // Output: "Hello !!!Wdlor"
    }
}
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the total number of characters in the input string. This is because we need to sort each word, which takes O(n log n) time. The space complexity is O(n), where n is the total number of characters in the input string, as we need to store the sorted words in a `StringBuilder` object.
