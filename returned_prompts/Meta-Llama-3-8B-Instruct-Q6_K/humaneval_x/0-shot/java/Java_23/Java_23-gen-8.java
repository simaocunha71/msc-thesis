        return string.length();
    }
}

Explanation:
The provided code defines a class named `Solution` with a method `strlen` that takes a `String` object as an input parameter. The method returns the length of the given string.

 Inside the `strlen` method, the `length()` method of the `String` class is used to get the length of the given string. The `length()` method returns the number of characters in the string.

 The provided examples demonstrate how to use the `strlen` method to get the length of an empty string (`""`) and a string with three characters (`"abc"`). The method correctly returns `0` for an empty string and `3` for the string `"abc"`. 

 This code is a simple implementation of the `strlen` function, which is commonly used in programming languages like C to get the length of a string. In Java, the `length()` method is used to achieve the same result.
