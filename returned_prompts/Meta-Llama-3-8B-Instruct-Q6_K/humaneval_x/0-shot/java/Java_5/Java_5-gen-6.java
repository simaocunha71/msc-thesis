The task is to create a function `intersperse` that takes a list of integers `numbers` and an integer `delimiter` as input. The function should insert the `delimiter` between every two consecutive elements of the input list `numbers`.

Here is the Java solution for the problem:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<Integer> intersperse(List<Integer> numbers, int delimiter) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++) {
            result.add(numbers.get(i));
            if (i < numbers.size() - 1) {
                result.add(delimiter);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

This solution uses a new `ArrayList` `result` to store the final output. It iterates over the input list `numbers` and adds each element to the `result` list. If the current index `i` is less than the size of the `numbers` list minus 1, it means that there is at least one more element to be processed. In this case, it adds the `delimiter` to the `result` list. Finally, it returns the `result` list.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3]` and the delimiter is `4`, the output will be `[1, 4, 2, 4, 3]`. If the input list is empty, the output will be an empty list. If the input list contains only one element, the output will be the same as the input list. If the input list contains only two elements, the output will be the same as the input list with the delimiter inserted between the two elements. If the input list contains more than two elements, the output will be the input list with the delimiter inserted between every two consecutive elements.
