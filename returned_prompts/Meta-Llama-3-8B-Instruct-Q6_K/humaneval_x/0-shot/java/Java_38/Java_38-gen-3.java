The problem is asking to implement two functions, `encodeCyclic` and `decodeCyclic`. The `encodeCyclic` function takes a string as input and returns an encoded string by cycling groups of three characters. The `decodeCyclic` function takes an encoded string as input and returns the decoded string.

The `encodeCyclic` function works by splitting the input string into groups of three characters. If a group has fewer than three characters, it is left as is. Otherwise, it is cycled by moving the first character to the end of the group. The groups are then concatenated together to form the encoded string.

The `decodeCyclic` function works by reversing the process of the `encodeCyclic` function. It splits the encoded string into groups, and for each group, it checks if it has fewer than three characters. If it does, it leaves it as is. Otherwise, it reverses the cycling done by the `encodeCyclic` function by moving the last character to the beginning of the group. The groups are then concatenated together to form the decoded string.

Here is the corrected code for the `encodeCyclic` and `decodeCyclic` functions:
```java
public class Solution {
    public String encodeCyclic(String s) {
        List<String> groups = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i += 3) {
            groups.add(s.substring(i, Math.min(i + 3, s.length())));
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < groups.size(); i++) {
            if (groups.get(i).length() == 3) {
                groups.set(i, groups.get(i).substring(1) + groups.get(i).charAt(0));
            }
        }
        return String.join("", groups);
    }

    public String decodeCyclic(String s) {
        List<String> groups = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i += 3) {
            groups.add(s.substring(i, Math.min(i + 3, s.length())));
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < groups.size(); i++) {
            if (groups.get(i).length() == 3) {
                groups.set(i, groups.get(i).charAt(2) + groups.get(i).substring(0, 2));
            }
        }
        return String.join("", groups);
    }
}
```
The `encodeCyclic` function is implemented as
