The given solution is implementing a function to encode and decode a string by cycling groups of three characters. Here is the explanation of the code:

The `encodeCyclic` function takes a string as input and returns the encoded string. It works as follows:

1. It splits the input string into groups of three characters each using a loop and a substring operation.
2. It then cycles each group by moving the first character to the end of the group, effectively rotating the group by one position. This is done using the substring operation and concatenation.
3. The encoded string is then returned by joining all the groups together using a join operation.

The `decodeCyclic` function takes the encoded string as input and returns the original string. It works as follows:

1. It splits the encoded string into groups of three characters each using a loop and a substring operation.
2. It then decodes each group by moving the last character to the beginning of the group, effectively rotating the group back to its original position. This is done using the substring operation and concatenation.
3. The decoded string is then returned by joining all the groups together using a join operation.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    public String encodeCyclic(String s) {
        List<String> groups = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i += 3) {
            groups.add(s.substring(i, Math.min(i + 3, s.length())));
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < groups.size(); i++) {
            if (groups.get(i).length() == 3) {
                groups.set(i, groups.get(i).substring(1) + groups.get(i).charAt(0));
            } else if (groups.get(i).length() == 2) {
                groups.set(i, groups.get(i) + "x");
            } else {
                groups.set(i, groups.get(i));
            }
        }
        return String.join("", groups);
    }

    public String decodeCyclic(String s) {
        List<String> groups = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i += 3) {
            groups.add(s.substring(i, Math.min(i + 3, s.length())));
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < groups.size(); i++) {
            if (groups.get(i).length() == 3) {
                groups.set(i, groups.get(i).substring(
