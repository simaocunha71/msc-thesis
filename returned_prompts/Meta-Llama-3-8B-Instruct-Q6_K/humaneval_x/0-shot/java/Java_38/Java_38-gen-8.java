The given problem is to implement a function that takes a string as input and returns the decoded string. The input string is encoded using the encodeCyclic function, which cycles each group of three characters unless the group has fewer than three characters.

Here is the solution to the problem:

```java
public String decodeCyclic(String s) {
    // split string to groups. Each of length 3.
    List<String> groups = new ArrayList<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i += 3) {
        groups.add(s.substring(i, Math.min(i + 3, s.length())));
    }
    // decode elements in each group. Unless group has fewer elements than 3.
    for (int i = 0; i < groups.size(); i++) {
        if (groups.get(i).length() == 3) {
            groups.set(i, groups.get(i).charAt(2) + groups.get(i).charAt(1) + groups.get(i).charAt(0));
        }
    }
    return String.join("", groups);
}
```

The decodeCyclic function takes a string as input, splits it into groups of three characters, and then decodes each group by reversing the cyclic shift. If a group has fewer than three characters, it is not decoded. Finally, the decoded groups are joined together to form the original string.
