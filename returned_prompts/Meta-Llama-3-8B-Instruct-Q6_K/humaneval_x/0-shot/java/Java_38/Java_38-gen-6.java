This Java code is intended to implement a function that encodes a given string by cycling groups of three characters. The encoded string is then decoded back to its original form.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the code works:

1. The `encodeCyclic` function takes a string `s` as input and splits it into groups of three characters each. This is done using a for loop that iterates over the string in steps of 3, appending each group of characters to a `List` called `groups`.

2. The `encodeCyclic` function then cycles the elements in each group, unless the group has fewer elements than 3. This is done by checking the length of each group in the `List`. If a group has 3 elements, it is cycled by moving the first character to the end of the group. This is done using the `substring` method to extract the group, and then concatenating the remaining elements (excluding the first character) with the first character.

3. The `encodeCyclic` function then joins the cycled groups together using the `String.join` method to form the encoded string.

4. The `decodeCyclic` function takes an encoded string `s` as input and reverses the process of encoding. It splits the encoded string into groups of three characters each, and then decodes each group by moving the first character to the beginning of the group.

Here is the complete code:
```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    /**
    returns encoded string by cycling groups of three characters.
     */
    public String encodeCyclic(String s) {
        List<String> groups = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i += 3) {
            groups.add(s.substring(i, Math.min(i + 3, s.length())));
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < groups.size(); i++) {
            if (groups.get(i).length() == 3) {
                groups.set(i, groups.get(i).substring(1) + groups.get(i).charAt(0));
            }
        }
        return String.join("", groups);
    }

    /**
    takes as input string encoded with encodeCyclic function. Returns decoded string.
     */
    public String decodeCyclic(String s) {
        List<String> groups = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i += 3) {
            groups.add(s
