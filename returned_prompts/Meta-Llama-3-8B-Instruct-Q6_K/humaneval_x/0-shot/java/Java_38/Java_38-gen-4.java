The given code seems to be correct. It correctly encodes a string by cycling groups of three characters. 

However, there's a small issue with the decodeCyclic function. It does not correctly decode the string. The decodeCyclic function should reverse the cyclic shift of each group of three characters. 

Here's the correct decodeCyclic function:

```java
/**
takes as input string encoded with encodeCyclic function. Returns decoded string.
 */
public String decodeCyclic(String s) {
    // split string to groups. Each of length 3.
    List<String> groups = new ArrayList<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i += 3) {
        groups.add(s.substring(i, Math.min(i + 3, s.length())));
    }
    // reverse each group to get the original string
    for (int i = 0; i < groups.size(); i++) {
        if (groups.get(i).length() == 3) {
            groups.set(i, String.valueOf(groups.get(i).charAt(2)) + String.valueOf(groups.get(i).charAt(1)) + String.valueOf(groups.get(i).charAt(0)));
        }
    }
    return String.join("", groups);
}
```

This decodeCyclic function correctly decodes the encoded string by reversing each group of three characters. It checks if each group has length 3, and if it does, it reverses the group by concatenating the characters in the reverse order. If a group has fewer than 3 characters, it leaves it unchanged. The decoded string is then returned as a single string by joining the groups together.
