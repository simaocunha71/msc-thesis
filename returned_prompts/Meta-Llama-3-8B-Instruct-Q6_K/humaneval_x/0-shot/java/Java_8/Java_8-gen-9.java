    public List<Integer> sumProduct(List<Integer> numbers) {
        int sum = 0;
        int product = 1;
        
        for (int num : numbers) {
            sum += num;
            product *= num;
        }
        
        return Arrays.asList(sum, product);
    }    
}  // Corrected code. The function sumProduct takes a list of integers as input and returns a list containing the sum and product of all the integers in the list. The function initializes the sum to 0 and the product to 1, then iterates over the list, adding each number to the sum and multiplying each number by the product. Finally, it returns a list containing the sum and product.
