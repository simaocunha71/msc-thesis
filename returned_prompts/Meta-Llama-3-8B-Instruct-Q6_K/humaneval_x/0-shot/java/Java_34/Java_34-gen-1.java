        for (Integer i : l) {

Explanation: 
1. We create a `LinkedHashSet` object called `set`.
2. We iterate over each element in the input list `l` using a for-each loop.
3. For each element, we add it to the `set`. Since `set` is a `LinkedHashSet`, it automatically removes any duplicate elements.
4. Finally, we convert the `set` to a `List` using the `ArrayList` constructor and return it. This ensures that the returned list is sorted and contains unique elements. 

Note: The `LinkedHashSet` class is used instead of a `HashSet` to preserve the original order of elements in the input list. If you want to preserve the order of elements, you should use a `LinkedHashSet` instead of a `HashSet`. If you don't care about the order, you can use a `HashSet` instead of a `LinkedHashSet`. 

Also, note that the `ArrayList` constructor is used to convert the `set` to a `List`. This is because `set` is a `Set` and not a `List`. If you want to convert a `Set` to a `List`, you should use the `ArrayList` constructor. If you want to convert a `List` to a `Set`, you should use the `HashSet` constructor. 

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list. This is because we iterate over each element in the list once. The space complexity is also O(n), where n is the number of unique elements in the input list. This is because we store all unique elements in the `set`. 

The output of this solution will be a `List` containing all unique elements in the input list, in the order they first appeared in the input list. For example, if the input list is `[5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]`, the output will be `[0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]`.
