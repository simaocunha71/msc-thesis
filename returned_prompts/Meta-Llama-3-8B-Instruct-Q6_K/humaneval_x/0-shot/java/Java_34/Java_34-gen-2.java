Here is the solution:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<Integer> unique(List<Integer> l) {
        Set<Integer> set = new LinkedHashSet<>();
        for (int i : l) {
            set.add(i);
        }
        return new ArrayList<>(set);
    }
}
```

Explanation:

1. We create a `LinkedHashSet` called `set` to store unique elements.
2. We iterate over the input list `l` using a for-each loop.
3. For each element `i` in the list, we add it to the `set` using the `add` method.
4. Since `set` is a `LinkedHashSet`, it automatically removes duplicates and maintains the order of elements.
5. Finally, we convert the `set` to an `ArrayList` using the constructor `ArrayList<>(set)` and return it. This ensures that the resulting list is sorted according to the order in which the elements were added to the set. If you want to sort the list in a specific order, you can use the `sort` method of the `List` interface.

Note: The `LinkedHashSet` is used to maintain the order of elements, while a `HashSet` would not preserve the order. If you want to use a `HashSet`, you would need to use a different approach, such as sorting the resulting list.
