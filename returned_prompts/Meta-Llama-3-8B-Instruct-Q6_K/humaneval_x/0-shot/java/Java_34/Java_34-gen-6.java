public class Solution {
    public List<Integer> unique(List<Integer> l) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i : l) {
            if (!result.contains(i)) {
                result.add(i);
            }
        }
        Collections.sort(result);
        return result;
    }
}
In this solution, we create a new list and add each element from the input list to the new list if it is not already present in the new list. Then, we sort the new list using the `Collections.sort()` method and return it. This ensures that the output list contains the sorted and unique elements from the input list. 
This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the contains() method in the list, where n is the size of the input list. This can be optimized to O(n log n) by using a set to keep track of unique elements and then converting the set to a list. Here is the optimized solution:

public class Solution {
    public List<Integer> unique(List<Integer> l) {
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (int i : l) {
            set.add(i);
        }
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>(set);
        Collections.sort(result);
        return result;
    }
}
This solution uses a HashSet to store unique elements, which has a constant time complexity for the add() method. Then, it converts the set to a list and sorts the list. This optimized solution has a time complexity of O(n log n).
