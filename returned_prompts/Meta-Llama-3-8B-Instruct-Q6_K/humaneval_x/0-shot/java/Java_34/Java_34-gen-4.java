    public List<Integer> unique(List<Integer> l) {
        List<Integer> uniqueList = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i : l) {
            if (!uniqueList.contains(i)) {
                uniqueList.add(i);
            }
        }
        Collections.sort(uniqueList);
        return uniqueList;
    }

Explanation:
This solution uses a simple loop to iterate over the input list. For each element, it checks if the uniqueList already contains that element. If not, it adds the element to the uniqueList. This ensures that each element in the input list is added to the uniqueList only once.

After all elements have been processed, the uniqueList is sorted using the Collections.sort() method. The sorted uniqueList is then returned.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the number of elements in the input list. The space complexity is O(n) as we need to store all unique elements in the uniqueList.
