Explanation:
The given problem is to find the number of even and odd digits in a given integer. To solve this problem, we can convert the integer into a string and then iterate over each character (digit) in the string. If the digit is even, increment the even count, otherwise increment the odd count. Finally, return the even count and odd count as a list of integers.

In the given solution, we first convert the integer into a string and then iterate over each character in the string. For each character, we parse it into an integer and check if it is even or odd. If it is even, increment the even count, otherwise increment the odd count. Finally, we add the even count and odd count to a list and return the list.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of digits in the integer. This is because we are iterating over each digit in the integer once. The space complexity is O(1), as we are using a constant amount of space to store the even count and odd count.  



Note:

*   The problem statement does not specify the type of the output. However, based on the given examples, it seems that the output should be a list of integers. Therefore, we return a list of integers containing the even count and odd count.
*   The problem does not specify whether the input integer can be negative or not. However, in the given solution, we handle negative integers by converting them into strings. This is because the problem statement does not specify any restrictions on the input integer.
*   The problem does not specify whether the input integer can have leading zeros or not. However, in the given solution, we do not consider leading zeros as digits. This is because the problem statement does not specify any restrictions on the input integer.  



Test cases:

*   `evenOddCount(-12)` should return `[1, 1]`
*   `even
