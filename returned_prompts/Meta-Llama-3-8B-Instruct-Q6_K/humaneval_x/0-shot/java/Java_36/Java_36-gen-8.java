Explanation:
The task is to count the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than a given number `n` which are divisible by 11 or 13.

In the solution, we initialize a variable `count` to 0. We then iterate from 1 to `n-1`. For each integer `i`, we check if it is divisible by 11 or 13 using the modulus operator (`%`). If it is, we convert the integer to a string using `String.valueOf(i)`. We then use the `indexOf` method to find the index of the character '7' in the string. If '7' is found, we increment the `count` by 1.

Finally, we return the `count` which represents the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than `n` which are divisible by 11 or 13. The time complexity of this solution is O(n) as we iterate `n` times. The space complexity is O(1) as we use a constant amount of space to store the `count` variable.
