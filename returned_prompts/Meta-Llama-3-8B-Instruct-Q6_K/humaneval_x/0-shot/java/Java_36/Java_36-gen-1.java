The given code is supposed to count the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13. However, the code provided has a few issues:

1.  The code is not handling the case when the number is divisible by both 11 and 13.
2.  The code is not correctly counting the occurrences of the digit 7 in the numbers.
3.  The code is not efficient as it is converting the number to a string and then splitting it to count the occurrences of the digit 7.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
public int fizzBuzz(int n) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (i % 11 == 0 || i % 13 == 0) {
            String str = String.valueOf(i);
            for (char c : str.toCharArray()) {
                if (c == '7') {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

In this code, we are directly iterating over the characters of the string representation of the number and checking if the character is '7'. If it is, we increment the count. This way, we are correctly counting the occurrences of the digit 7 in the numbers.

Also, we are handling the case when the number is divisible by both 11 and 13 by checking the condition `i % 11 == 0 || i % 13 == 0`. This way, we are counting the occurrences of the digit 7 in all numbers that are divisible by 11 or 13.
