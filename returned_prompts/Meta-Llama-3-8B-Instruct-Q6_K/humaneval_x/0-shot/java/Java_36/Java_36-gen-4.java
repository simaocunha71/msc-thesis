R:
The function fizzBuzz calculates the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13. 

The code iterates over all integers from 1 to n-1. For each integer, it checks if it is divisible by 11 or 13. If it is, it converts the integer to a string and counts the number of times the digit 7 appears in the string. The total count is then returned.

For example, when n is 50, the function will count the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than 50 which are divisible by 11 or 13. Since there are no such integers, the function returns 0. When n is 78, the function will count the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than 78 which are divisible by 11 or 13. Since 77 is divisible by 11 and 13, and contains the digit 7, the function returns 2. When n is 79, the function will count the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than 79 which are divisible by 11 or 13. Since 77 is divisible by 11 and 13, and contains the digit 7, and 73 is divisible by 13, and contains the digit 7, the function returns 3.
