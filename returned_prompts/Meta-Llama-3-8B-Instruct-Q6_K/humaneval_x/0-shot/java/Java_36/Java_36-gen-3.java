The code works by iterating over all integers from 1 to n-1, checking if each integer is divisible by 11 or 13. If it is, it converts the integer to a string and checks each character in the string to see if it is a '7'. If it is, it increments a count variable. The method returns the count at the end. 

However, this code has a time complexity of O(n*m), where n is the input number and m is the maximum number of digits in an integer less than n. This is because for each integer, we are converting it to a string and checking each character. This could be slow for large inputs. 

We could improve the time complexity to O(n) by using a different approach. We could convert the integer to a string once and then check each character in the string for the digit 7. This would reduce the time complexity to O(n), which is much faster for large inputs. 

Here is the improved code:

```java
public int fizzBuzz(int n) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (i % 11 == 0 || i % 13 == 0) {
            String s = Integer.toString(i);
            count += countSevens(s);
        }
    }
    return count;
}

public int countSevens(String s) {
    int count = 0;
    for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
        if (c == '7') {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

In this code, we have a separate method `countSevens` that takes a string and returns the number of times the digit 7 appears in the string. We call this method for each integer that is divisible by 11 or 13, and add the result to the total count. This way, we only need to convert each
