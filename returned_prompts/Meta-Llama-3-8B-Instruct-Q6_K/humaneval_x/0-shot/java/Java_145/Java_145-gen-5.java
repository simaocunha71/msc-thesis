Explanation:
The problem is asking to sort a list of integers based on the sum of their digits. If there are multiple items with the same sum of digits, they should be sorted based on their original index in the list.

Here is a Java solution that uses the `sort()` function from the `List` interface. The sorting is done based on a custom comparator that compares two integers based on their sum of digits and their original index in the list.

The `sumOfDigits()` function is used to calculate the sum of digits for a given integer. It does this by repeatedly taking the remainder of the number when divided by 10 (which gives the last digit), adding it to a running total, and then dividing the number by 10 to move to the next digit.

The `orderByPoints()` function sorts the list of integers based on the sum of their digits and their original index. It does this by using the `sort()` function and providing a custom comparator. The comparator first compares the sum of digits for the two integers. If the sums are equal, it compares their original indices in the list. If the sums are not equal, it compares the sums directly.

The function returns the sorted list of integers.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 11, -1, -11, -12]`, the output will be `[-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]`, which is the list sorted based on the sum of digits and original index. If the input list is `[]`, the output will be an empty list.
