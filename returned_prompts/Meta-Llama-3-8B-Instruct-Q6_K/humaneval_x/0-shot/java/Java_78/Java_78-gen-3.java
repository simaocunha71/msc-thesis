Explanation:
This solution iterates through the input string and checks each character. If the character is a hexadecimal digit that is a prime number (2, 3, 5, 7, B, D, F), it increments the count. The function returns the count at the end. The solution does not check if the input string is a valid hexadecimal number. It simply checks each character and counts the primes. This is because the problem statement specifies that the input is always correct or empty string, and symbols A,B,C,D,E,F are always uppercase. This solution is efficient because it only iterates through the input string once and does not use any complex algorithms. It is also easy to understand and implement.
