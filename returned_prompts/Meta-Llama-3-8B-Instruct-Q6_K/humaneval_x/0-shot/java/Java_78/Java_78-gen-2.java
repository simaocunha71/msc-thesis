Explanation:
The function hexKey takes a string num as input, which is a hexadecimal number. It then iterates over each character in the string. If the character is a digit between 2 and 7 (inclusive), it increments the count. If the character is 'B', 'D', or 'F', it also increments the count. Finally, it returns the count. This solution is efficient because it only requires a single pass over the input string, and it does not use any advanced data structures or complex algorithms. It is also easy to understand and maintain, making it a good choice for this problem.
