The solution is to iterate through all integers from 1 to n, check if the integer is a palindrome, and if it is, check if it is even or odd. The number of even and odd palindromes are counted separately and stored in a list.

The `isPalindrome` function checks if a number is a palindrome by reversing the number and comparing it with the original number. The `isEven` function checks if a number is even by checking if the remainder of the number divided by 2 is 0.

The `evenOddPalindrome` function iterates through all integers from 1 to n, checks if the integer is a palindrome, and if it is, checks if it is even or odd. The number of even and odd palindromes are counted separately and stored in a list.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the input number. This is because we are iterating through all integers from 1 to n. The space complexity is O(1), as we are using a constant amount of space to store the counts of even and odd palindromes.

Here is the code in Java:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<Integer> evenOddPalindrome(int n) {
        int even = 0, odd = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (isPalindrome(i)) {
                if (isEven(i)) {
                    even++;
                } else {
                    odd++;
                }
            }
        }
        List<Integer> result = new
