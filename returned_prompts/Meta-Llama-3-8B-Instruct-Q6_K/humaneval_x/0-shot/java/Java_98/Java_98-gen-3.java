Explanation:

The problem is asking to count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices of a given string. 

Here's the solution:

- We initialize a counter variable `count` to 0.
- We loop through the string using a for loop.
- Inside the loop, we check if the current index `i` is even (i.e., `i % 2 == 0`) and if the character at that index is an uppercase letter (using `Character.isUpperCase(s.charAt(i))`).
- If both conditions are true, we increment the `count` variable.
- Finally, we return the `count` variable.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string, as we are iterating through the string once. The space complexity is O(1), as we are using a constant amount of space to store the counter variable.
