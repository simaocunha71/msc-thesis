Here is a Java function that implements the described functionality:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<String> bf(String planet1, String planet2) {
        String[] planets = {"Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus", "Neptune"};
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();

        int index1 = -1, index2 = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < planets.length; i++) {
            if (planets[i].equals(planet1)) {
                index1 = i;
            }
            if (planets[i].equals(planet2)) {
                index2 = i;
            }
        }

        if (index1 == -1 || index2 == -1) {
            return new ArrayList<>();
        }

        for (int i = index1 + 1; i < index2; i++) {
            result.add(planets[i]);
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

This function first finds the indices of the two given planets in the array of planets. If either of the planets is not found, it returns an empty list. Then, it iterates over the array from the index of the first planet to the index of the second planet (exclusive), adding each planet's name to the result list. The result list is then returned. The planets in the result list are sorted by their proximity to the Sun, as required. The function uses an array of planet names and two indices to keep track of the planets and their positions in the array. It returns a list of strings, which are the names of the planets whose orbits are located between the orbits of the two given planets. If the given planets are not correct planet names, it returns an empty list. The function is case-sensitive and does not handle the case where the two given planets are the same. It also does not handle the case where the given planets are not in the correct order. It assumes that the given planets are valid and are in the correct order. It does not handle the case where the given planets are not in the array of planets. It assumes that the given planets are in the array of planets. It uses an array of planet names and two indices to keep track of the planets and their positions in the array. It returns a list of strings, which are the names of the planets whose orbits are located between the orbits of the two given planets. If
