S:
The provided solution uses a brute force approach to check if the given number is the multiplication of three prime numbers. It iterates from 2 to the given number and checks if each number is prime. If a prime number is found, it checks if the given number is divisible by that prime number. If the given number is divisible, it increments the count of prime factors. If the count exceeds 3, it returns false. If the count is exactly 3, it returns true.

However, this approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the given number. This can be inefficient for large numbers.

A more efficient approach would be to use a sieve to generate prime numbers up to the given number, and then iterate through the prime numbers to find three prime numbers that multiply to the given number.

Here is an optimized solution:

```java
public boolean isMultiplyPrime(int a) {
    if (a < 100) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 2; i * i <= a
