The problem is asking to create a function that takes a string representing a number and returns the closest integer to it. If the number is equidistant from two integers, it should round it away from zero.

Here's the solution in Java:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int closestInteger(String value) {
        double num = Double.parseDouble(value);
        int integer = (int) num;
        if (num - integer < 0.5) {
            return integer;
        } else {
            return integer + 1;
        }
    }
}
```

In this solution, we first parse the string into a double. Then we convert the double into an integer. If the difference between the double and the integer is less than 0.5, we return the integer. Otherwise, we return the integer plus one.

This solution works because if the number is equidistant from two integers, the one we should return is the one that is the farthest from zero. If the difference is less than 0.5, it means the number is closer to the integer than to the integer plus one. If the difference is greater than or equal to 0.5, it means the number is closer to the integer plus one. Therefore, we round it away from zero.
