The problem is asking you to create a function that takes a string value representing a number and returns the closest integer to it. If the number is equidistant from two integers, round it away from zero.

The given examples suggest that the function should round away from zero. For example, closest_integer("14.5") should return 15 and closest_integer("-14.5") should return -15.

Here is the Java solution for the problem:

```java
public class Solution {
    public static int closestInteger(String value) {
        double num = Double.parseDouble(value);
        int integerPart = (int) num;
        if (num - integerPart >= 0.5) {
            return integerPart + 1;
        } else {
            return integerPart;
        }
    }
}
```

This solution first converts the string value to a double. It then calculates the integer part of the number. If the difference between the number and its integer part is greater than or equal to 0.5, it returns the integer part plus 1. Otherwise, it returns the integer part. This ensures that the function rounds away from zero when the number is equidistant from two integers.
