The problem is asking for a function that takes a string representation of a number and returns the closest integer to it. If the number is equidistant from two integers, it should round away from zero.

The given examples suggest that the function should behave as follows:
- closest_integer("10") should return 10
- closest_integer("15.3") should return 15

The problem does not specify if the input string can be an empty string or if it will always contain a number. However, based on the given examples, it can be assumed that the input string will always contain a number.

Here is a Java solution for the problem:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int closestInteger(String value) {
        double num = Double.parseDouble(value);
        int intPart = (int) num;
        if (num - intPart >= 0.5) {
            return intPart + 1;
        } else {
            return intPart;
        }
    }
}
```

In this solution, we first parse the input string into a double. Then we calculate the integer part of the number. If the fractional part is greater than or equal to 0.5, we return the integer part plus one. Otherwise, we return the integer part. This ensures that we always round away from zero when the number is equidistant from two integers.
