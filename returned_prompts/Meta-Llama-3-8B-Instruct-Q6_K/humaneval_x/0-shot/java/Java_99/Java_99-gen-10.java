The problem statement is asking to create a function that takes a string representing a number and returns the closest integer to it. If the number is equidistant from two integers, round it away from zero.

Here is the solution in Java:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int closestInteger(String value) {
        double num = Double.parseDouble(value);
        int integer = (int) num;
        if (Math.abs(num - integer) >= 0.5) {
            if (num > integer) {
                return integer + 1;
            } else {
                return integer - 1;
            }
        } else {
            return integer;
        }
    }
}
```

This solution first parses the input string into a double. Then it calculates the integer part of the number using the cast to int. If the absolute difference between the number and the integer is greater than or equal to 0.5, it returns the integer that is farther away from zero. Otherwise, it returns the integer part of the number. This is because the problem statement asks to round away from zero when the number is equidistant from two integers. For example, if the number is 14.5, the closest integer is 15, not 14, because 15 is farther away from zero. Similarly, if the number is -14.5, the closest integer is -15, not -14.
