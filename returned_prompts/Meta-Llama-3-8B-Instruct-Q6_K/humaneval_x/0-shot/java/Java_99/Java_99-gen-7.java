The problem is asking to create a function that takes a string representing a number and returns the closest integer to it. If the number is equidistant from two integers, it should round away from zero.

Here's the solution:

```java
import java.lang.Math;

public class Solution {
    public int closest_integer(String value) {
        double num = Double.parseDouble(value);
        int integerPart = (int) num;
        if (Math.abs(num - integerPart) < 0.5) {
            return integerPart;
        } else if (num - integerPart > 0) {
            return integerPart + 1;
        } else {
            return integerPart - 1;
        }
    }
}
```

In this solution, we first parse the input string to a double. Then, we calculate the integer part of the number using the `int` keyword. If the absolute difference between the number and the integer part is less than 0.5, we return the integer part. If the number is greater than the integer part, we return the integer part plus 1. Otherwise, we return the integer part minus 1.

This solution works because it rounds away from zero when the number is equidistant from two integers. For example, if the input is "14.5", the integer part is 14 and the absolute difference is 0.5, so we return 15. If the input is "-14.5", the integer part is -14 and the absolute difference is 0.5, so we return -15. If the input is "15.3", the integer part is 15 and the absolute difference is 0.3, so we return 15. If the input is "-15.3", the integer part is -15 and the absolute difference is 0.3, so we return -15.
