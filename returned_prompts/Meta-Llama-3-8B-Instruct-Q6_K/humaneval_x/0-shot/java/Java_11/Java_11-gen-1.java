    String result = "";
    for(int i = 0; i < a.length(); i++) {
        if(a.charAt(i) == b.charAt(i)) {
            result += '0';
        } else {
            result += '1';
        }
    }
    return result;
}  // Correct solution

Explanation:
In this problem, we need to find the binary XOR operation of two given binary strings. The XOR operation is performed bit by bit, where if the corresponding bits are the same, the result is 0, and if they are different, the result is 1.

The solution provided above correctly implements this operation by iterating through the strings and appending the result of the XOR operation to a new string. If the current bits in the two strings are the same, it appends '0' to the result; otherwise, it appends '1'.

For example, given the inputs "010" and "110", the output would be "100", which is the result of the binary XOR operation. The correct solution is thus the one provided above.
