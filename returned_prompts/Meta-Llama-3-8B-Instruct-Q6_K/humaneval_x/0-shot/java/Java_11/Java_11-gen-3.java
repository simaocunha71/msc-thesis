Solution
The given problem is to perform binary XOR operation on two input strings consisting of 1s and 0s. The XOR operation can be performed by iterating over the strings and for each position, if the bits are different (i.e., one is 1 and the other is 0), the result is 1, otherwise, it is 0. The result is then returned as a string. In this solution, we use a for loop to iterate over the strings and add the result to a new string. If the bits at the current position are the same, we add '0' to the result, otherwise, we add '1'. Finally, we return the result as a string. 

For example, if we call the function with the inputs "010" and "110", the function will return "100". This is because the XOR operation is performed as follows:

010 (a) XOR 110 (b) = 100

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input strings, as we are iterating over the strings once. The space complexity is also O(n), as we are storing the result in a new string. 

Note that this solution assumes that the input strings are of the same length. If the strings are of different lengths, we can pad the shorter string with leading zeros to make them the same length. However, this is not necessary as the XOR operation can be performed on strings of different lengths by simply iterating over the shorter string and padding the result with leading zeros. 

Also, this solution does not handle the case where the input strings are null or empty. We can add checks at the beginning of the function to handle these cases. For example, we can return an empty string if either of the input strings is null or empty. 

Here is the modified solution that handles these cases:

```java
public String stringXor(String a, String b) {
    if(a == null || a.isEmpty() || b == null || b.isEmpty()) {
        return "";
    }
