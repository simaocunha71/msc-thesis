Output:
100
Explanation:
The function stringXor() performs binary XOR operation on two input strings a and b.
It iterates over the characters of the strings, and for each position, it calculates the XOR of the corresponding bits.
The result is a new string where each character is the XOR of the corresponding characters in the input strings.
In this case, the XOR of "010" and "110" is "100".  Therefore, the output is "100".  This is a binary string representation of the result of the XOR operation.
The main function in the Main class creates an object of the Solution class and calls the stringXor() function with the input strings "010" and "110".  It then prints the result.  The output is "100".  This is the expected result of the XOR operation on the input strings.  This is a binary string representation of the result of the XOR operation.
This solution works by iterating over the characters of the input strings, and for each position, it calculates the XOR of the corresponding bits.  This is done by subtracting the ASCII value of '0' from the character to get the binary value (0 for '0' and 1 for '1'), and then performing the XOR operation.  The result is a new string where each character is the XOR of the corresponding characters in the input strings.  This is a correct implementation of the XOR operation on binary strings.  It is also efficient in terms of time complexity, as it only needs to iterate over the characters of the input strings once.  It is also efficient in terms of space complexity, as it only needs to store the result string.  Therefore, this solution is suitable for large input strings.  It is also easy to understand and implement
