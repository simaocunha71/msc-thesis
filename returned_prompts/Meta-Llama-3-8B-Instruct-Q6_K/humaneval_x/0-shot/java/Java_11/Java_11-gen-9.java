            } else {

Explanation:
The problem is asking to perform a binary XOR operation on two input strings a and b. The XOR operation is performed by comparing each bit of the two strings. If the bits are the same, the result is 0; otherwise, the result is 1.

The given solution uses a simple for loop to iterate over the input strings. It checks each character of the strings and appends the result of the XOR operation to the result string. If the characters at the current position are the same, it appends "0" to the result; otherwise, it appends "1".

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input strings. The space complexity is also O(n), as it needs to store the result string. This solution is efficient for small to medium-sized input strings. For larger input strings, a more efficient solution using bitwise operations or a more advanced algorithm may be needed.
