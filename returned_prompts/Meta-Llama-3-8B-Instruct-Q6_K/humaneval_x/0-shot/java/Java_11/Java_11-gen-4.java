Explanation:
The provided Java code defines a method named `stringXor` that takes two strings `a` and `b` as input. Both strings consist only of 1s and 0s. The method performs a binary XOR operation on the input strings and returns the result as a string.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the code works:

1.  It initializes an empty `StringBuilder` object `sb` to store the result.
2.  It iterates through each character in the input strings `a` and `b` using a `for` loop.
3.  For each character, it converts the character to its corresponding integer value using the expression `charAt(i) - '0'`. This is because the ASCII value of '0' is 48, and the ASCII value of '1' is 49. Subtracting '0' from the character's ASCII value gives the integer value (0 or 1).
4.  It performs a binary XOR operation on the integer values of the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` using the `^` operator.
5.  It appends the result of the XOR operation as a character to the `StringBuilder` object `sb` using the `append` method.
6.  Finally, it returns the resulting string by calling the `toString` method on the `StringBuilder` object.

The output of the code will be a string consisting of 1s and 0s, which is the result of the binary XOR operation performed on the input strings. For example, if the input strings are "010" and "110", the output will be "100", which is the result of the XOR operation performed on the corresponding bits of the input strings.
