Explanation:
The given problem requires you to create a function called `rollingMax` which takes a list of integers as an input and returns a list of rolling maximum elements found until that given moment in the sequence. 

The function starts by initializing an empty list called `result` and an integer variable `max` with the first element of the input list. 

Then, it iterates over the input list starting from the second element. In each iteration, it updates the `max` variable with the maximum value between the current `max` and the current element, and adds the updated `max` to the `result` list.

Finally, it returns the `result` list. 

In the main function, we create an instance of the `Solution` class, create a list of integers, call the `rollingMax` function, and print the result.  The output is the list of rolling maximum elements found until that given moment in the sequence. 

This problem can be solved using a simple iterative approach with a single loop, and it has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the input list.  The space complexity is also O(n) as we need to store the result in a list.  The code is concise and easy to understand.  It handles the edge case where the input list is empty correctly by returning an empty list.  It also handles the edge case where the input list has only one element correctly by returning a list with that element.  The function is flexible and can be used with any list of integers.  It is also efficient and can handle large lists of integers.  The code is well
