The provided solution is using a simple algorithm to find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string. The idea is to find the longest postfix of the supplied string that is a palindrome, and then append the reverse of the string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix to the end of the string.

Here is a breakdown of the solution:

1. The `isPalindrome` method checks if a given string is a palindrome by comparing characters from the start and end of the string, moving towards the center.
2. The `makePalindrome` method takes a string as input and returns the shortest palindrome that begins with the supplied string.
3. The algorithm starts by initializing two pointers, `i` and `j`, to the start and end of the string, respectively.
4. It then iterates through the string, comparing characters at positions `i` and `j`. If the characters are not equal, it returns `false`, indicating that the string is not a palindrome.
5. If the characters are equal, it increments `i` and decrements `j` to move towards the center of the string.
6. Once the algorithm finds the longest postfix of the supplied string that is a palindrome, it appends the reverse of the string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix to the end of the string.
7. The resulting string is the shortest palindrome that begins with the supplied string.

Here is the corrected code:
```
public class Solution {
    public String makePalindrome(String string) {
        if (isPalindrome(string)) {
            return string;
        }
        for (int i = string.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            String prefix = string.substring(0, i + 1);
            String postfix = string.substring(i + 1);
            String reversePostfix = new StringBuilder(postfix).reverse().toString();
            if (isPalindrome(prefix + reversePostfix)) {
                return prefix + reversePostfix;
            }
        }
        return "";
    }

    public boolean isPalindrome(String string) {
        int i = 0;
        int j = string.length() - 1;
        while (i < j) {
            if (string.charAt(i) != string.charAt(j)) {
                return false;
            }
            i++;
            j--;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
This code uses the `isPalindrome` method to check if a given string is a palindrome, and the `makePalindrome` method to find the shortest palindrome
