The problem is asking to shift the digits of an integer to the right by a certain number of positions, and then convert the result back to a string. If the shift value is greater than the number of digits in the integer, the digits should be reversed instead.

Here's a Java solution for the problem:

```java
public String circularShift(int x, int shift) {
    String str = String.valueOf(x);
    int n = str.length();
    shift = shift % n;
    if (shift == 0) {
        return str;
    }
    return str.substring(shift) + str.substring(0, shift);
}
```

This solution first converts the integer to a string. Then it calculates the actual shift value by taking the modulus of the shift value with the number of digits in the string. If the shift value is 0, it means the input string is the same as the original integer, so it returns the original string.

If the shift value is not 0, it uses the `substring` method to extract the part of the string that should be shifted to the end and the part that should be kept at the beginning. The two parts are then concatenated to form the final result.

For example, if the input integer is 12 and the shift value is 1, the function will return "21". If the shift value is 2, the function will return "12" because the shift value is greater than the number of digits in the integer, so the digits are reversed.
