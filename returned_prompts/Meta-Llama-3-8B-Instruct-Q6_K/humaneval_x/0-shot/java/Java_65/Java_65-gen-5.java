Explanation:

This problem is asking to shift the digits of an integer to the right by a certain number of positions. If the shift is greater than the number of digits, the digits should be reversed.

The solution is to first convert the integer to a string. Then, calculate the actual shift by taking the remainder of the shift divided by the length of the string. This is because shifting by the length of the string or more is equivalent to reversing the string.

Next, use the `substring` method to split the string into two parts: the part to be shifted and the part that will remain at the beginning. The part to be shifted is the substring from the end of the string to the position of the shift, and the part that will remain at the beginning is the substring from the beginning to the position of the shift.

Finally, concatenate the two parts to get the result string.

For example, if the input is `12` and the shift is `1`, the result will be `"21"`. If the shift is `2`, the result will be `"12"`. If the shift is `3`, the result will be `"21"`, which is the same as shifting by `1`. If the shift is `4`, the result will be `"12"`, which is the same as shifting by `0`. If the shift is `5`, the result will be `"21"`, which is the same as shifting by `1`. And so on.
