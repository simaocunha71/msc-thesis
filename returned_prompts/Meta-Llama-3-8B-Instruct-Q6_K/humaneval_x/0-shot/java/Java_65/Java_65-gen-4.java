Here is the Java code for the problem:

```java
public class Solution {
    public String circularShift(int x, int shift) {
        int numDigits = (int) Math.floor(Math.log10(Math.abs(x))) + 1;
        shift = shift % numDigits;
        if (shift == 0) {
            return String.valueOf(x);
        }
        String str = String.valueOf(x);
        return str.substring(shift) + str.substring(0, shift);
    }
}
```

The code works as follows:

- It first calculates the number of digits in the integer x.
- It then calculates the effective shift value by taking the modulus of the shift value with the number of digits. This is because shifting by more digits than the number of digits in the integer is equivalent to shifting by the remainder of the division of the shift value by the number of digits.
- If the effective shift value is 0, it means that the shift value is equal to the number of digits, so the function returns the original string representation of the integer.
- Otherwise, it converts the integer to a string and uses the substring method to extract the part of the string that should be moved to the beginning of the result. It then concatenates this part with the rest of the string to form the final result. The substring method takes two parameters: the start index and the end index. The end index is exclusive, so the substring method extracts the part of the string from the start index to the end index. In this case, the start index is the shift value, and the end index is the shift value plus the length of the string minus the shift value. This ensures that the part of the string that should be moved to the beginning of the result is correctly extracted. The rest of the string is the part of the string from the end index to the end of the string. This is obtained by calling the substring method with the end index as the start index and the length of the string as the end index. The two parts of the string are then concatenated using the + operator to form the final result.
