Explanation:
This problem is asking to shift the digits of a given integer to the right by a certain number of positions. If the shift number is greater than the number of digits in the integer, the digits should be reversed.

In the given solution, we first convert the integer to a string using `String.valueOf(x)`. Then we get the length of the string using `s.length()`.

If the shift number is greater than or equal to the length of the string, we return the original string. This is because shifting by a number greater than the length of the string is the same as reversing the string.

If the shift number is less than the length of the string, we use the `substring` method to get the desired part of the string. We get the part of the string from the shift position to the end of the string using `s.substring(shift)`, and the part of the string from the beginning of the string to the shift position using `s.substring(0, shift)`. We then concatenate these two parts using the `+` operator to get the final result.

For example, if the input integer is 12 and the shift number is 1, the output will be "21". If the shift number is 2, the output will be "12". If the shift number is 3, the output will be "21" again because shifting by 3 is the same as shifting by 1. If the shift number is 4, the output will be "12" again because shifting by 4 is the same as reversing the string.
