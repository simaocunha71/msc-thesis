S:
This problem can be solved by using a simple loop to iterate over all numbers in the given range, and then convert each number to a string to check for even digits. 

In this solution, I used two nested loops. The outer loop iterates over all numbers in the range, and the inner loop checks each digit of the number to see if it's even. If it is, the digit is added to the result list. 

The `Math.min` and `Math.max` functions are used to ensure the range is processed correctly, regardless of the order of the input numbers. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(n*m), where n is the range of numbers and m is the maximum number of digits in a number in the range. This is because for each number in the range, we are checking each digit to see if it's even. 

The space complexity is O(n*m) as well, because we are storing all the even digits in the result list. 

Note that the problem statement does not specify whether the range is inclusive or exclusive. In this solution, I assume the range is inclusive, meaning that both a and b are included in the range. If the range is exclusive, the solution would need to be adjusted accordingly.

The code provided is written in Java and is a solution to the given problem. It uses two nested loops to iterate over all numbers in the given range and check each digit to see if it's even. The even digits are added to the result list. The code also uses the `Math.min` and `Math.max` functions to ensure the range is processed correctly, regardless of the order of the input numbers. 

Here is the code:
```java
import java.util.*;

    public List<Integer> generateIntegers(int a, int b) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for(int i = Math.min(a, b); i <= Math.max(a, b); i++) {
            String str = String.valueOf(i);
