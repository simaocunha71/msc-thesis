Here is a Java solution for the problem. The problem asks to filter a list of strings based on a given prefix. The filterByPrefix method takes two parameters: a list of strings and a prefix. It returns a new list containing only the strings from the original list that start with the given prefix.

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

class Solution {
    public List<String> filterByPrefix(List<String> strings, String prefix) {
        return strings.stream()
                .filter(s -> s.startsWith(prefix))
                .collect(Collectors.toList());
    }
}
```

In the above solution, we use Java 8's Stream API to filter the list of strings. The filter method is used to filter the stream of strings based on the condition s.startsWith(prefix). The collect method is then used to collect the filtered strings into a new list. The result is a new list containing only the strings from the original list that start with the given prefix. 

For example, if we call filterByPrefix(Arrays.asList("abc", "bcd", "cde", "array"), "a"), the method will return a list ["abc", "array"] because these are the strings from the original list that start with "a". If we call filterByPrefix(List.of(), "a"), the method will return an empty list because there are no strings in the original list that start with "a". 

This solution is efficient because it uses Java's Stream API which is designed to work with large datasets and is optimized for performance. It also makes the code more concise and readable by using lambda expressions and method references.
