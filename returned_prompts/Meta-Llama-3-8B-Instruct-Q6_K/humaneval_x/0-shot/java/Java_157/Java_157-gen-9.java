        System.out.println(solution.rightAngleTriangle(3, 4, 5));  // returns true

The code checks if the lengths of the three sides of a triangle form a right-angled triangle. It uses the Pythagorean theorem to check if the lengths form a right-angled triangle. The theorem states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

The code takes three integers as input, representing the lengths of the three sides of the triangle. It first checks if the lengths are positive. If they are, it checks if the sum of the squares of the lengths of two sides is equal to the square of the length of the third side. If this condition is met, it returns true, indicating that the lengths form a right-angled triangle. Otherwise, it returns false.

In the main method, the code creates an instance of the Solution class and calls the rightAngleTriangle method with two sets of input values. The first call returns true, indicating that the lengths 3, 4, and 5 form a right-angled triangle. The second call returns false, indicating that the lengths 1, 2, and 3 do not form a right-angled triangle.
