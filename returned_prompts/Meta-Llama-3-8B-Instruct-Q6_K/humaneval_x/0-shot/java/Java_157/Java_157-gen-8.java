R:
The problem is asking to check if the given sides of a triangle can form a right-angled triangle or not. A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is 90 degrees.

In a right-angled triangle, the sum of the squares of the lengths of the two shorter sides is equal to the square of the length of the longest side. This property is used in the solution.

The solution uses a simple if-else statement to check if the given sides can form a right-angled triangle. It checks if the sum of the squares of the lengths of two sides is equal to the square of the length of the third side. If it is, then the function returns true, indicating that the given sides can form a right-angled triangle. Otherwise, it returns false.

For example, if the given sides are 3, 4, and 5, the function will return true because the sum of the squares of the lengths of the two shorter sides (3 and 4) is equal to the square of the length of the longest side (5). Similarly, if the given sides are 1, 2, and 3, the function will return false because the sum of the squares of the lengths of the two shorter sides (1 and 2) is not equal to the square of the length of the longest side (3).
