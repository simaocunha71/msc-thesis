S:
This problem can be solved using the Pythagorean theorem. The Pythagorean theorem states that for a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

In the given problem, we are given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to check if the three sides form a right-angled triangle.

Here is the solution in Java:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(rightAngleTriangle(3, 4, 5));  // true
        System.out.println(rightAngleTriangle(1, 2, 3));  // false
    }

    public static boolean rightAngleTriangle(int a, int b, int c) {
        // Check if the given sides can form a right-angled triangle.
        // A triangle is a right-angled triangle if the sum of the squares of the
        // lengths of any two sides is equal to the square of the length of the third
        // side. This is known as the Pythagorean theorem.
        // Let's check if the given sides satisfy this condition.
        if ((a * a) + (b * b) == (c * c) || (a * a) + (c * c) == (b * b) || (b * b) + (c * c) == (a * a)) {
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
}
```

In this solution, we are checking if the sum of the squares of the lengths of any two sides is equal to the square of the length of the
