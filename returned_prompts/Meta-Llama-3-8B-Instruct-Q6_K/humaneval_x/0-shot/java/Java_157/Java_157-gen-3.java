Explanation:

The problem is asking whether the given three sides of a triangle can form a right-angled triangle.

First, we need to check if the sides can form a triangle at all. This is done using the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.

If the sides cannot form a triangle, we can immediately return false.

Next, we need to check if one side is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle. This is done by checking if the sum of the squares of the other two sides is equal to the square of the hypotenuse. If this condition is met, we can return true.

If neither of these conditions is met, we can return false.

The code implements this logic using if-else statements. It first checks if the sides can form a triangle, and if not, returns false. Then, it checks if one side is the hypotenuse, and if so, returns true. If neither of these conditions is met, it returns false.
