Here is the correct implementation of the function:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public boolean belowThreshold(List<Integer> l, int t) {
        for (Integer num : l) {
            if (num >= t) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

Explanation:
The function `belowThreshold` takes a list of integers `l` and an integer `t` as input. It iterates over each number in the list using a for-each loop. If any number in the list is greater than or equal to the threshold `t`, it immediately returns `false`. If it finishes iterating over the list without finding any numbers greater than or equal to the threshold, it returns `true`, indicating that all numbers in the list are below the threshold. This implementation has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list, because it needs to iterate over each element in the list. The space complexity is O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the threshold and the loop variable.
