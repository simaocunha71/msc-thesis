The problem is asking to create a method called `belowThreshold` that takes a list of integers and an integer threshold as input. The method should return `true` if all the numbers in the list are less than the threshold, and `false` otherwise.

Here's a simple Java solution for this problem:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public boolean belowThreshold(List<Integer> l, int t) {
        for (Integer num : l) {
            if (num >= t) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

In this solution, we iterate over each number in the list. If we find a number that is greater than or equal to the threshold, we immediately return `false`. If we finish iterating over the list without finding any numbers greater than or equal to the threshold, we return `true`. This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the list, because we need to iterate over the entire list in the worst case. The space complexity is O(1), because we only use a constant amount of space to store the threshold and a boolean variable.
