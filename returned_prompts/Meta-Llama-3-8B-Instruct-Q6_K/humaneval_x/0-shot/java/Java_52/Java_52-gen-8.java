The function `belowThreshold` checks if all numbers in the list `l` are below a certain threshold `t`. It iterates over the list and checks if each number is less than `t`. If any number is greater than or equal to `t`, it returns `false`. If it checks all numbers and none of them are greater than or equal to `t`, it returns `true`.

Here is the complete code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public boolean belowThreshold(List<Integer> l, int t) {
        for (int i : l) {
            if (i >= t) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

The `Arrays.asList(1, 2, 4, 10)` and `Arrays.asList(1, 20, 4, 10)` are just examples of input lists. The `Arrays.asList` method is used to convert an array to a list. The `>>>` symbol is used to represent the output of the function. It is a common convention in Python to use `>>>` to represent the output of a function. In Java, we would typically use `System.out.println` to print the output. However, since this is a Java method, we can simply return a boolean value to indicate whether the condition is met. In this case, we return `true` if all numbers in the list are below the threshold, and `false` otherwise.
