The problem is asking to check if all numbers in the list are below a certain threshold. Here is the solution in Java:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public boolean belowThreshold(List<Integer> l, int t) {
        for (int num : l) {
            if (num >= t) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

In this solution, we iterate over each number in the list. If we find a number that is greater than or equal to the threshold, we immediately return `false`. If we finish iterating over the list without finding any numbers above the threshold, we return `true`. This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the list, because we iterate over the list once. It has a space complexity of O(1), because we only use a constant amount of space to store the threshold and the return value.
