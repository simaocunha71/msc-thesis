C:
public class Solution {
    public boolean isPrime(int n) {
        if (n <= 1) return false;
        for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {
            if (n % i == 0) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }

Explanation:
The given problem is to write a function that checks whether a given number is prime or not. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

In the given code, the `isPrime` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether `n` is prime or not.

The function first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1. If it is, the function returns `false` because prime numbers are greater than 1.

Then, the function iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive) and checks if `n` is divisible by any of the numbers in this range. If it is, the function returns `false` because `n` is not prime.

If the function does not find any divisors of `n` in the range, it returns `true` because `n` is prime.

The time complexity of this function is O(sqrt(n)) because it iterates up to the square root of `n`. The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the loop variable and the result.
