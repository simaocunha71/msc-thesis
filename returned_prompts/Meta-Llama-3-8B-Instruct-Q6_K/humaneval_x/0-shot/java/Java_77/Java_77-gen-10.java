        int root = (int)Math.floor(Math.pow(a, 1.0/3.0));
        return root * root * root == a;
    }
}

Explanation:
The problem is asking to write a function that checks if a given integer is a perfect cube. A perfect cube is an integer that can be expressed as the cube of some integer.

In this solution, we are using the Math.pow() function to calculate the cube root of the given integer. We then convert the result to an integer using the Math.floor() function, to avoid any decimal values.

Finally, we check if the cube of the calculated root is equal to the given integer. If it is, then the function returns true, indicating that the integer is a perfect cube. Otherwise, it returns false.
