        int i = 0;
        while (Math.pow(i, 3) <= a) {
            if (Math.pow(i, 3) == a) {
                return true;
            }
            i++;
        }
        return false;
    }
}

Solution: 

The problem is asking to write a function that checks if a given integer is a perfect cube or not. A perfect cube is an integer that can be expressed as the cube of an integer. For example, 1, 8, and 27 are perfect cubes because they can be expressed as 1^3, 2^3, and 3^3 respectively.

The function should return true if the input integer is a perfect cube, and false otherwise.

Here is the solution in Java:
```java
public boolean iscube(int a) {
    int i = 0;
    while (Math.pow(i, 3) <= a) {
        if (Math.pow(i, 3) == a) {
            return true;
        }
        i++;
    }
    return false;
}
```
This function works by iterating through all integers from 0 to the square root of the input integer, and checking if the cube of the current integer is equal to the input integer. If it finds a match, it returns true. If it doesn't find a match after checking all integers, it returns false.

Note that the while loop condition is `Math.pow(i, 3) <= a`, which ensures that the loop stops when `i` is greater than the cube root of `a`. This is because if `i` is greater than the cube root of `a`, then `Math.pow(i, 3)` will be greater than `a`, and the function can return false.

The time complexity of this function is O(sqrt(n)), where n is the input integer. This is because the function iterates through all integers from 0 to the square root of n. The space complexity is O(1), because the function only uses a constant amount of space to store the loop variable and the result.
