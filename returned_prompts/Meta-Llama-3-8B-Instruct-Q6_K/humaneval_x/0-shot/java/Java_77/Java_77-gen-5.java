SOLUTION:
The provided code is a correct solution for the problem. It checks if a given integer is a perfect cube by iterating from 1 to the square root of the absolute value of the integer, and checking if the cube of the current iteration is equal to the integer. If it is, the function returns true, indicating that the integer is a perfect cube. Otherwise, it returns false.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. `int temp = Math.abs(a);`: This line calculates the absolute value of the input integer `a`. This is done to ensure that the function works correctly for negative inputs as well.

2. `int i = 1;`: This line initializes a variable `i` to 1, which will be used to iterate from 1 to the square root of the absolute value of the integer.

3. `while(i * i * i <= temp)`: This is a while loop that continues as long as the cube of `i` is less than or equal to the absolute value of the integer.

4. `if(i * i * i == temp) { return true; }`: Inside the loop, this line checks if the cube of `i` is equal to the absolute value of the integer. If it is, the function returns true, indicating that the integer is a perfect cube.

5. `i++;`: This line increments the value of `i` by 1, which is necessary for the loop to continue.

6. `return false;`: If the loop completes without finding a perfect cube, the function returns false, indicating that the integer is not a perfect cube.

This solution has a time complexity of O(sqrt(n)), where n is the input integer, because it iterates up to the square root of the absolute value of the integer. This makes it efficient for large inputs.
