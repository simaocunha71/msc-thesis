Explanation:
This problem asks to write a function that takes an integer a and returns true if this integer is a cube of some integer number. The function should always return a valid result.

The problem can be solved by using the concept of cube root. A cube of an integer is the result of raising that integer to the power of 3. So, if a is a cube of some integer, then it can be represented as a^3 = c^3, where c is an integer. 

In this solution, we calculate the cube root of the input number a, raise it to the power of 3, and compare the result with the original number a. If they are equal, then a is a cube of some integer, and the function returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

The code uses the Math.pow() function to calculate the power of the number, and the Math.round() function to round the result to the nearest integer, because the cube root of a number might not be an exact integer. 

The iscube() function takes an integer a as input, calculates its cube root, raises it to the power of 3, and returns true if the result is equal to a, and false otherwise. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(1), because it only involves a constant number of operations, and a space complexity of O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the variables. 

The examples provided in the problem statement demonstrate the correct behavior of the function. For example, iscube(1) returns true because 1 is a cube of 1, and iscube(2) returns false because 2 is not a cube of any integer. Similarly, iscube(-1) returns true because -1 is a cube of -1, and iscube(64) returns true because 64 is a cube of 4. The function correctly handles the edge cases of 0 and 180, returning true and false respectively.
