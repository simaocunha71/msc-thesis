        for(int i = 0; i*i*i <= a; i++) {
            if(i*i*i == a) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

Explanation:
This problem asks us to write a function that takes an integer a and returns true if this integer is a cube of some integer number. We can do this by iterating from 0 to the square root of a and checking if the cube of the current number is equal to a. If it is, we return true. If we reach the end of the loop without finding such a number, we return false.
In the above code, we use a for loop to iterate from 0 to the square root of a. For each number i, we check if i*i*i is equal to a. If it is, we return true. If we reach the end of the loop without finding such a number, we return false.
The time complexity of this solution is O(sqrt(n)), where n is the input integer a. This is because we are iterating up to the square root of a. The space complexity is O(1), as we are using a constant amount of space to store the loop variable and the return value.
