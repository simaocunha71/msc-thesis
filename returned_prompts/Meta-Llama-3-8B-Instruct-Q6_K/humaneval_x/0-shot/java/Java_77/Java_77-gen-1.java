        int n = (int)Math.pow(a, (1.0/3.0));
        if (a < 0) {
            n = -n;
        }
        return (n * n * n) == a;
    }

Solution:

The problem is asking to write a function that takes an integer as input and returns true if the integer is a perfect cube, and false otherwise.

A perfect cube is an integer that can be expressed as the cube of an integer. For example, 1, 8, and 27 are perfect cubes because they can be expressed as 1^3, 2^3, and 3^3, respectively.

The solution is to use the Math.pow function in Java to calculate the cube root of the input integer. If the input integer is negative, we need to take the absolute value of the cube root to ensure that we get the correct result.

Here is the Java code for the solution:
```
public boolean iscube(int a) {
    int n = (int)Math.pow(a, (1.0/3.0));
    if (a < 0) {
        n = -n;
    }
    return (n * n * n) == a;
}
```
This code works by first calculating the cube root of the input integer using the Math.pow function. If the input integer is negative, it takes the absolute value of the cube root. Then, it checks if the cube of the calculated cube root is equal to the input integer. If it is, the function returns true, indicating that the input integer is a perfect cube. Otherwise, it returns false.
