        int i = 0;
        while (i * i * i <= a) {
            if (i * i * i == a) {
                return true;
            }
            i++;
        }
        return false;
    }
}

S:
The problem is asking to create a function that takes an integer as an input and returns true if the integer is a perfect cube. A perfect cube is a number that can be expressed as the cube of an integer. For example, 1, 8, and 27 are perfect cubes because they can be expressed as 1^3, 2^3, and 3^3 respectively.

The provided function `iscube(int a)` iterates from 0 to `a` and checks if the cube of the current number is equal to `a`. If it finds a match, it returns `true`. If it doesn't find a match after checking all numbers up to `a`, it returns `false`.

Here is the implementation in Java:
```java
public boolean iscube(int a) {
    int i = 0;
    while (i * i * i <= a) {
        if (i * i * i == a) {
            return true;
        }
        i++;
    }
    return false;
}
```
This function works by iterating from 0 to `a` and checking if the cube of the current number is equal to `a`. If it finds a match, it returns `true`. If it doesn't find a match after checking all numbers up to `a`, it returns `false`. The time complexity of this function is O(sqrt(a)), because it needs to iterate up to the square root of `a` to find the cube root. The space complexity is O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the variable `i`.
