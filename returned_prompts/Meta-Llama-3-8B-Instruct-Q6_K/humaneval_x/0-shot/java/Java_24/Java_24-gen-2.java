        int i = n;
        while (i > 1) {
            if (n % i == 0) {
                return i;
            }

Explanation:
This solution uses a simple while loop to iterate from n down to 1. For each number i, it checks if n is divisible by i (i.e., if n % i == 0). If it is, then i is the largest divisor smaller than n. If the loop completes without finding a divisor, then 1 is the largest divisor (since 1 divides any number). The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the input number. The space complexity is O(1), since we only use a constant amount of space to store the variables. This solution is straightforward and easy to understand, but it can be slow for large input numbers. For example, if n is a large prime number, the loop will have to iterate all the way down to 1. A more efficient solution might use a different approach, such as using the fact that the largest divisor of n is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of n and the previous largest divisor. This would allow us to skip over many numbers and reduce the time complexity. However, this solution is simple and easy to understand, and it works well for small to moderate-sized input numbers.
