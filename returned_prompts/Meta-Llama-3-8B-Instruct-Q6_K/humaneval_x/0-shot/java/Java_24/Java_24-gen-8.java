        if (n <= 1) {
            return n;
        }

        for (int i = n / 2; i > 1; i--) {
            if (n % i == 0) {
                return i;

    }
}

Solution class has a method called largestDivisor which takes an integer n as input. This method finds the largest divisor of n that is less than n.

This problem can be solved by iterating from n/2 to 2 and checking if the current number is a divisor of n. If it is, then it is the largest divisor. If no divisor is found, then the function returns 1, which means that 1 is the largest divisor.

Here is the Java code for this problem:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int largestDivisor(int n) {
        if (n <= 1) {
            return n;
        }

        for (int i = n / 2; i > 1; i--) {
            if (n % i == 0) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        return 1;
    }
}
```

This code works by iterating from n/2 to 2 and checking if the current number is a divisor of n. If it is, then it is the largest divisor. If no divisor is found, then the function returns 1, which means that 1 is the largest divisor. The time complexity of this solution is O(sqrt(n)), where n is the input number. This is because the loop iterates at most sqrt(n) times.

For example, if we call largestDivisor(15), the function will return 5, which is the largest divisor of 15 that is less than 15. If we call largestDivisor(12), the function will return 3, which is the largest divisor of 12 that is less than 12. If we call largestDivisor(1), the function will return 1, which is the largest divisor of 1 that is less than 1. If we call largestDivisor(0), the function will return 0, which is the largest divisor of 0 that is less than 0. However, the function will return 0 for input 0, and it will return the input number for input 1, which is not according to the problem statement. This is because the problem statement does not specify what to do with input 0 and 1.
