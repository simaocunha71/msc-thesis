        if(n <= 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        for(int i = n - 1; i > 0; i--) {
            if(n % i == 0) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        return 1;
    }
}

E:
The largest divisor of a number n is the largest number that divides n evenly, smaller than n. 

The solution checks each number from n-1 down to 1 to find the largest divisor. 

If n is less than or equal to 0, the largest divisor is 0.

The time complexity is O(n), as we are checking each number from n-1 down to 1. The space complexity is O(1), as we are not using any extra space. 

In the given example, the largest divisor of 15 is 5. 

Note: The function return 1 if the number is a prime number, because 1 is the only number that divides a prime number evenly. 

This solution is not optimal for large numbers, because it checks each number from n-1 down to 1. A more efficient solution would be to use the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of n and the numbers from n-1 down to 1. This would reduce the time complexity to O(log n). 

Here is the optimized solution:

```java
public int largestDivisor(int n) {
    for(int i = n - 1; i > 0; i--) {
        if(gcd(n, i) > 1) {
            return gcd(n, i);
        }
    }
    return 1;
}

public int gcd(int a, int b) {
    if(b == 0) {
        return a;
    }
    return gcd(b, a % b);
}
```

In this optimized solution, the gcd function uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of two numbers. The gcd function is called from the largestDivisor function to find the largest divisor of n. The time complexity of this optimized solution is O(log n), which is more efficient than the original solution for large numbers.
