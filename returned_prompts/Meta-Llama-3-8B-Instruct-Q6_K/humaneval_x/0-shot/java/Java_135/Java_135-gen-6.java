This problem can be solved by using two pointers technique. The idea is to iterate through the array and for each element, find the complement which is the largest index of an element which is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it.

Here is the solution in Java:
```
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int canArrange(List<Integer> arr) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int num : arr) {
            if (map.containsKey(num)) {
                map.put(num, map.get(num) + 1);
            } else {
                map.put(num, 1);
            }
        }
        int res = -1;
        for (int num : arr) {
            int complement = arr.get(0) - num;
            if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
                if (res == -1) {
                    res = arr.size() - map.get(complement) - 1;
                } else {
                    res = Math.min(res, arr.size() - map.get(complement) - 1);
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
The idea is to create a map where the key is the element and the value is the frequency of the element in the array. Then for each element, find the complement which is the largest index of an element which is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. If the complement exists in the map, update the result with the maximum index of the complement.

For example, for the array [1,2,4,3,5], the map will be {1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1}. For the first element 1, the complement is 5, which is not in the map, so the result is -1. For the second element 2, the complement is 3, which is in the map, so the result is updated to 3. For the third element 4, the complement is 1, which is in the map, so the result is updated to 3. For the fourth element 3, the complement is 2, which is in the map, so the result is updated to 3. For the fifth element 5, the complement is 1, which is in the map, so the result is updated to 3.

The time complexity is O(n) where n is the size of the array, and the
