The problem is asking to find the largest index of an element in the array which is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. If no such element exists, return -1.

Here is the solution in Java:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int canArrange(List<Integer> arr) {
        int maxIndex = -1;
        for (int i = 1; i < arr.size(); i++) {
            if (arr.get(i) <= arr.get(i - 1)) {
                maxIndex = i;
            }
        }
        return maxIndex;
    }
}
```

In this solution, we iterate through the array starting from the second element (index 1) to the end. For each element, we check if it is less than or equal to the previous element. If it is, we update the maxIndex. At the end of the iteration, maxIndex will hold the largest index of an element which is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. If no such element exists, maxIndex will still be -1, which is the correct return value.

Note: The problem statement does not specify that the array will not contain duplicate values. However, since the problem statement also mentions that the given array will not contain duplicate values, we can assume that the array does not contain duplicate values. If the array can contain duplicate values, we would need to modify the solution to handle that case. For example, we could use a HashSet to keep track of the elements we have seen so far, and check if an element is less than or equal to the previous element before adding it to the set. This would ensure that we do not consider duplicate values. However, since the problem statement does not specify that the array can contain duplicate values, we can simply ignore this case and assume that the array does not contain duplicate values.
