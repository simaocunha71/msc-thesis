The problem is asking to find the largest index i such that arr[i] is not greater than or equal to arr[i-1]. If no such index exists, return -1.

Here is the solution in Java:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int canArrange(List<Integer> arr) {
        int res = -1;
        for (int i = 1; i < arr.size(); i++) {
            if (arr.get(i) <= arr.get(i - 1)) {
                res = i;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

This solution iterates through the array from the second element to the end. For each element, it checks if it is less than or equal to the previous element. If it is, it updates the result with the current index. Finally, it returns the result. If no such element is found, the result remains -1.
