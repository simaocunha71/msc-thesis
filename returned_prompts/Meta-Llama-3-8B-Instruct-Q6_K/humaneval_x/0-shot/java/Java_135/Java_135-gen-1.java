This problem can be solved by iterating through the array and keeping track of the count of each number that is 1 less than the current number. If the count of any such number is less than the frequency of the current number, then it means that there is no element which is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it, so we return -1. Otherwise, we return the largest index of such an element.

Here is the Java code for the solution:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int canArrange(List<Integer> arr) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
            if (map.containsKey(arr.get(i) - 1)) {
                map.put(arr.get(i) - 1, map.get(arr.get(i) - 1) + 1);
            } else {
                map.put(arr.get(i) - 1, 1);
            }
        }
        int maxIndex = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
            if (map.getOrDefault(arr.get(i) - 1, 0) >= arr.size() - i) {
                maxIndex = i;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        return maxIndex;
    }
}
```

In this code, we first create a HashMap to store the count of each number that is 1 less than the current number. Then we iterate through the array and for each number, we check if its value minus 1 exists in the map. If it does, we increment its count in the map. If it doesn't, we add it to the map with a count of 1. After that, we iterate through the array again and for each number, we check if its value minus 1 has a count in the map that is greater than or equal to the remaining size of the array minus the current index. If it does, we update the maxIndex. Finally, we return the maxIndex. If maxIndex is still -1, it means that there is no element which is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it, so we return -1. Otherwise, we return the maxIndex.
