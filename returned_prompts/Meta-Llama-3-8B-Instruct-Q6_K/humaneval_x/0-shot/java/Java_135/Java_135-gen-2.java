The problem is asking to find the largest index of an element in the array which is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. If no such element exists, return -1. The array will not contain duplicate values.

Here is the solution in Java:
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int canArrange(List<Integer> arr) {
        int maxIndex = -1;
        for (int i = 1; i < arr.size(); i++) {
            if (arr.get(i - 1) <= arr.get(i)) {
                maxIndex = i;
            }
        }
        return maxIndex;
    }
}
```
The function `canArrange` takes a list of integers as input and returns the largest index of an element which is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. If no such element exists, it returns -1.

The function iterates over the array starting from the second element (index 1). For each element, it checks if the previous element is less than or equal to the current element. If it is, it updates the `maxIndex` variable with the current index. Finally, it returns the `maxIndex` variable.

For example, if the input array is `[1, 2, 4, 3, 5]`, the function will return 3, because the element at index 3 (3) is not greater than or equal to the element at index 2 (2). If the input array is `[1, 2, 3]`, the function will return -1, because there is no element in the array that satisfies the condition.
