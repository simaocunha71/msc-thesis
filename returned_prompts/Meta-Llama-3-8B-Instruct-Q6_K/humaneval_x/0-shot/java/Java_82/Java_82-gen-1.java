The problem is asking to write a function that takes a string as input and returns true if the length of the string is a prime number, and false otherwise.

Here is the Java solution for this problem:

```java
public boolean primeLength(String string) {
    int length = string.length();
    if (length <= 1) {
        return false;
    }
    for (int i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(length); i++) {
        if (length % i == 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

In this solution, we first calculate the length of the input string. Then we check if the length is less than or equal to 1, in which case we return false because prime numbers are greater than 1. 

Next, we iterate from 2 to the square root of the length, and for each number, we check if the length is divisible by that number. If it is, we return false because the length is not a prime number. 

If the length is not divisible by any number in this range, we return true because the length is a prime number. 

This solution works by using the property of prime numbers that they are only divisible by 1 and themselves. We only need to check up to the square root of the length because a larger factor of the length would be a multiple of a smaller factor that has already been checked. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(sqrt(n)) where n is the length of the string, which is efficient for large strings. 

Note that this solution assumes that the input string is not null. If the input string can be null, you should add a null check at the beginning of the function and return false in that case.
