```java
public boolean primeLength(String str) {
    int len = str.length();
    if (len <= 1) {
        return false;
    }
    if (len == 2) {
        return true;
    }
    for (int i = 2; i * i <= len; i++) {
        if (len % i == 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

Explanation:

The function `primeLength` takes a string as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the length of the string is a prime number or not.

1. First, it checks if the length of the string is less than or equal to 1. If it is, the function returns `false` because the length of a string with 0 or 1 characters is not a prime number.
2. If the length is 2, the function returns `true` because 2 is a prime number.
3. The function then checks if the length is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of the length. If it is, the function returns `false` because the length is not a prime number.
4. If the length is not divisible by any of the numbers, the function returns `true` because the length is a prime number.

Note that the function uses a simple trial division method to check if the length is a prime number. This method is not the most efficient way to check for primality, but it is sufficient for small inputs like the length of a string. For larger inputs, a more efficient method like the Miller-Rabin primality test may be needed.
