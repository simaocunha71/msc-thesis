class Solution {
    public boolean primeLength(String string) {
        int length = string.length();
        if (length <= 1) {
            return false;
        }
        for (int i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(length); i++) {
            if (length % i == 0) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
The solution checks if the length of the input string is a prime number. It does this by iterating from 2 to the square root of the length and checking if the length is divisible by any of these numbers. If it is, the function returns false, indicating that the length is not a prime number. If the length is not divisible by any of these numbers, the function returns true, indicating that the length is a prime number. 

This solution assumes that the input string is not null. If the input string can be null, you should add a check for null before calculating the length. 

Also, this solution does not handle the case where the length of the string is 1. According to the problem description, a length of 1 is not considered a prime number. Therefore, the function returns false for strings with a length of 1. If you want to consider a length of 1 as a prime number, you can add a special case at the beginning of the function to return true for lengths of 1. 

The time complexity of this solution is O(sqrt(n)), where n is the length of the input string. The space complexity is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the loop variables and the result.
