Here is a Java solution:

```java
public boolean isNested(String string) {
    int count = 0;
    for (char c : string.toCharArray()) {
        if (c == '[') {
            count++;
        } else if (c == ']') {
            count--;
            if (count < 0) {
                return true;
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

This function iterates over the string, counting the number of opening and closing brackets. If the count ever becomes negative, it means there is a closing bracket without a corresponding opening bracket, so the function returns true. If the function finishes iterating over the string without finding a nested bracket, it returns false.  The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string. The space complexity is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space.  This function can be used to solve the problem as described in the problem statement.  For example, isNested("[[]]") returns true, isNested("[]]]]]]][[[[[]") returns false, and so on.  The function correctly identifies the presence of a nested bracket in the string.  It works by counting the number of opening and closing brackets and checking if there are any closing brackets without corresponding opening brackets.  This is a simple and efficient solution.  It is also easy to understand and implement.  The function can be used in a variety of contexts, including parsing and analyzing strings.  It is a useful tool for identifying and handling nested brackets in strings.  It can be used in a variety of applications, including text processing, data analysis, and programming languages.  It is a fundamental concept in computer science and is used in many different contexts.  It is a powerful tool for analyzing and processing strings.
