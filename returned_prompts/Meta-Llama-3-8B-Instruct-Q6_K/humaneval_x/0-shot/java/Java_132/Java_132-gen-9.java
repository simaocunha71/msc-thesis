Here is a Java solution for this problem. This solution uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. If a closing bracket is encountered, it checks if the stack is empty or the top of the stack is an opening bracket. If it is, it returns true. If the stack is not empty or the top of the stack is not an opening bracket, it continues to the next iteration.

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public boolean isNested(String string) {
        Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();
        for (char c : string.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == '[') {
                stack.push(c);
            } else if (c == ']') {
                if (stack.isEmpty() || stack.pop() != '[') {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string, and a space complexity of O(n), as in the worst case, the stack will store all characters in the string. 

For example, for the input "[[]]", the function will return true, because there is a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket in the subsequence is nested. For the input "[]]]]]]][[[[[]", the function will return false, because there is no valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket in the subsequence is nested. For the input "[][]", the function will return false, because there is no valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket in the subsequence is nested. For the input "[[][]]", the function will return true, because there is a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket in the subsequence is nested. For the input "[[]][[", the function will return true, because there is a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket in the subsequence is nested.  ]]>]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]
