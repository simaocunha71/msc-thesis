The problem is asking to create a function that takes a string as input which contains only square brackets.
The function should return true if and only if there is a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket in the subsequence is nested.

Here is the solution:

```java
public boolean isNested(String string) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < string.length(); i++) {
        if (string.charAt(i) == '[') {
            count++;
        } else if (string.charAt(i) == ']') {
            if (count == 0) {
                return false;
            }
            count--;
        }
    }
    return count > 0;
}
```

This function uses a count variable to keep track of the number of opening brackets that have not been closed yet. It iterates over the input string, incrementing the count for each opening bracket and decrementing the count for each closing bracket. If the count becomes zero at any point, it means that there is no nested bracket, so the function returns false. At the end of the iteration, if the count is greater than zero, it means that there are unclosed opening brackets, which means that there is at least one nested bracket, so the function returns true. If the count is zero, it means that all brackets are balanced, so the function returns false.
