The problem is asking to create a function that takes a string of square brackets as input and returns true if there is a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket in the subsequence is nested. A subsequence is considered nested if it has at least one pair of brackets where the inner bracket is properly closed before the outer bracket.

Here is a Java solution using a stack:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public boolean isNested(String string) {
        Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();
        for (char c : string.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == '[') {
                stack.push(c);
            } else if (c == ']') {
                if (stack.isEmpty() || stack.pop() != '[') {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return !stack.isEmpty();
    }
}
```

This solution works by iterating over the input string and pushing each '[' onto a stack. When a ']' is encountered, the solution checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack is not a '['. If either condition is true, the solution returns false, indicating that the subsequence is not nested. If the solution iterates over the entire string without returning false, it checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, the solution returns true, indicating that the subsequence is not nested. If the stack is not empty, the solution returns false, indicating that the subsequence is nested. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, and the space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of '[' in the input string.
