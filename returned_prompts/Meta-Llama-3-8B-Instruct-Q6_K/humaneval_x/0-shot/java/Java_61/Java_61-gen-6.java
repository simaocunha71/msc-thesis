Explanation:
This problem is asking to check if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the given string.

We can solve this problem by using a stack data structure. We iterate through the string and for every opening bracket, we push it onto the stack. For every closing bracket, we check if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means there's no corresponding opening bracket for the closing bracket, so we return false. If the stack is not empty, we pop the opening bracket from the stack.

After iterating through the entire string, if the stack is empty, it means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so we return true. If the stack is not empty, it means there are some opening brackets that don't have corresponding closing brackets, so we return false.
