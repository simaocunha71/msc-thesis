Here is the correct code:

```java
public boolean correctBracketing(String brackets) {
    Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();
    for (char bracket : brackets.toCharArray()) {
        if (bracket == '(') {
            stack.push(bracket);
        } else if (bracket == ')') {
            if (stack.isEmpty()) {
                return false;
            }
            stack.pop();
        }
    }
    return stack.isEmpty();
}
```

This function uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means there is no corresponding opening bracket, so it returns false. If the stack is not empty, it pops the opening bracket from the stack. Finally, it returns whether the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.
