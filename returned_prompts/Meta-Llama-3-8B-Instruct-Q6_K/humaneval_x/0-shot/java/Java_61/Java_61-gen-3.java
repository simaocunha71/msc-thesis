Here is a simple Java solution that uses a Stack to keep track of the opening brackets. It iterates over the string, pushing opening brackets onto the stack and popping them off when it encounters a closing bracket. If the stack is empty when it encounters a closing bracket, or if it encounters an opening bracket when the stack is empty, it returns false. Otherwise, it returns true.

```java
import java.util.Stack;

public class Solution {
    public boolean correctBracketing(String brackets) {
        Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();
        for (char c : brackets.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == '(') {
                stack.push(c);
            } else if (c == ')') {
                if (stack.isEmpty()) {
                    return false;
                }
                stack.pop();
            }
        }
        return stack.isEmpty();
    }
}
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string, and a space complexity of O(n) due to the use of the stack. It is also quite efficient and easy to understand. The use of a stack allows us to keep track of the opening brackets in a way that is easy to understand and efficient to implement. The iteration over the string is also straightforward, making this solution easy to read and maintain.
