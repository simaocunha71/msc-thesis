Here is a simple Java solution for the problem. This solution uses a Stack to keep track of the opening brackets. For each character in the string, if it's an opening bracket, it's pushed onto the stack. If it's a closing bracket, the stack is checked to see if it's empty (which would mean there's no corresponding opening bracket) or if the top of the stack is an opening bracket (which would mean there is a corresponding opening bracket).

```java
public boolean correctBracketing(String brackets) {
    Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();
    for (char bracket : brackets.toCharArray()) {
        if (bracket == '(') {
            stack.push(bracket);
        } else if (bracket == ')') {
            if (stack.isEmpty()) {
                return false;
            }
            stack.pop();
        }
    }
    return stack.isEmpty();
}
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string, because it processes each character in the string once. The space complexity is O(n) as well, because in the worst case (when the string is all opening brackets), the stack will store all of them. 

You can test this method with the examples you provided:

```java
System.out.println(correctBracketing("(")); // false
System.out.println(correctBracketing("()")); // true
System.out.println(correctBracketing("(()())")); // true
System.out.println(correctBracketing(")(()")); // false
