```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public String concatenate(List<String> strings) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (String s : strings) {
            sb.append(s);
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```

Explanation:
In this solution, we use a `StringBuilder` object to concatenate the list of strings. We iterate over the list using a for-each loop and append each string to the `StringBuilder`. Finally, we return the string representation of the `StringBuilder` using the `toString()` method.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of strings in the list. The space complexity is also O(n), as we need to store the concatenated string in memory.
