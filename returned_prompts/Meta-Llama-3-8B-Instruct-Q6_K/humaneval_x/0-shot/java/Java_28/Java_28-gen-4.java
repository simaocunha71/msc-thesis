```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public String concatenate(List<String> strings) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (String str : strings) {
            sb.append(str);
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```

Explanation:
We use a StringBuilder to concatenate the list of strings. We iterate over the list of strings and append each string to the StringBuilder. Finally, we return the toString() of the StringBuilder, which is the concatenated string. This solution is more efficient than using the + operator to concatenate strings, as it avoids creating unnecessary temporary strings.
