Here is the Java solution for the problem. The solution iterates over the list of operations and keeps track of the current balance. If the balance ever falls below zero, the function returns true. If the function finishes iterating over all operations without the balance falling below zero, it returns false.

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public boolean belowZero(List<Integer> operations) {
        int balance = 0;
        for (int operation : operations) {
            balance += operation;
            if (balance < 0) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```



Explanation:

1. We start by initializing a variable `balance` to 0, which represents the current balance of the bank account.
2. We then iterate over the list of operations using a for-each loop.
3. For each operation, we add the operation amount to the `balance`.
4. We check if the `balance` is less than 0. If it is, we immediately return `true`, indicating that the balance has fallen below zero at some point.
5. If we finish iterating over all operations without the balance falling below zero, we return `false`, indicating that the balance never fell below zero.
