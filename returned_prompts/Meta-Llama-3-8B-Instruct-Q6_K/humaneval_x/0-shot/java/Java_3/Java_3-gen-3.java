Here is the solution in Java:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public boolean belowZero(List<Integer> operations) {
        int balance = 0;
        for (int operation : operations) {
            balance += operation;
            if (balance < 0) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

Explanation:

The function `belowZero` takes a list of integers as input, representing deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account. The function iterates over the list of operations and updates the balance accordingly. If the balance ever falls below zero, the function immediately returns `true`. If the loop completes without the balance ever falling below zero, the function returns `false`. The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of operations. The space complexity is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the balance and other variables. This solution is efficient and easy to understand, making it a good choice for this problem.
