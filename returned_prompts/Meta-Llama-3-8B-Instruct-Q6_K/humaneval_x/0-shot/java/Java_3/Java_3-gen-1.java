Explanation:
The given problem is about detecting if at any point the balance of a bank account falls below zero. The balance starts with zero and keeps changing due to deposit and withdrawal operations. 

To solve this problem, we can iterate over the list of operations and for each operation, we add it to the balance. If at any point the balance becomes negative, we return True. If we finish iterating over all operations and the balance is still non-negative, we return False. 

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of operations, and the space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the balance. 

The unit tests provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by this solution. For example, for the input [1, 2, 3], the balance will be 6, which is non-negative, so the function will return False. For the input [1, 2, -4, 5], the balance will become -4, which is negative, so the function will return True.
