The problem is asking to write a function that takes a string of parentheses as input, where the parentheses are grouped and separated by spaces. The function should return a list of integers, where each integer represents the deepest level of nesting of parentheses for the corresponding group.

Here is a Python solution for this problem:

```python
def parse_nested_parens(paren_string):
    result = []
    for group in paren_string.split():
        level = 0
        max_level = 0
        for char in group:
            if char == '(':
                level += 1
                max_level = max(max_level, level)
            elif char == ')':
                level -= 1
        result.append(max_level)
    return result
```

This function works by iterating over each group of parentheses in the input string. For each group, it initializes a `level` variable to keep track of the current level of nesting and a `max_level` variable to keep track of the deepest level of nesting seen so far. It then iterates over each character in the group, incrementing the `level` variable whenever it encounters an open parenthesis and decrementing it whenever it encounters a close parenthesis. It updates the `max_level` variable whenever it sees a deeper level of nesting. Finally, it appends the `max_level` to the result list. The function returns the result list at the end.

For example, if the input is `"(()()) ((())) () ((())()())"`, the function will return `[2, 3, 1, 3]`. This is because the deepest level of nesting for the first group is 2, for the second group is 3, for the third group is 1, and for the fourth group is 3.
