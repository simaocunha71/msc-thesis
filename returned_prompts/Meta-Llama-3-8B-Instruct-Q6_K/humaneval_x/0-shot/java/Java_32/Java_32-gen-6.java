The function `findZero` is used to find a root of a polynomial, given its coefficients. The polynomial is assumed to have an even number of coefficients, with the largest non-zero coefficient as the leading coefficient, which guarantees that there is a root. 

The function first checks if the input list is empty or has an odd number of coefficients, and throws a `RuntimeException` if either condition is true.

Then it uses the quadratic formula to find the root of the polynomial. The quadratic formula is derived from the formula for the root of a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0, which is x = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a. In this case, we have a polynomial of degree n, and we can use the formula recursively to find the root.

The formula used in the code is derived from the formula for the root of a quadratic equation, and is equivalent to the formula for the root of a polynomial of degree n. The formula is:

x = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a

where a, b, and c are the coefficients of the polynomial, and x is the root.

The function returns the root of the polynomial. If the polynomial has multiple roots, this function will return only one of them. If the polynomial has no real roots, this function will return `NaN` (Not a Number). 

Note that this function assumes that the input list has an even number of coefficients, and that the largest non-zero coefficient is the leading coefficient. If these assumptions are not met, the function will throw a `RuntimeException`. 

Also note that this function uses the quadratic formula to find the root of the polynomial, which may not be the most efficient method for large polynomials. For large polynomials, it may be more efficient to use numerical methods, such as the Newton-Raphson method, to find the root.
