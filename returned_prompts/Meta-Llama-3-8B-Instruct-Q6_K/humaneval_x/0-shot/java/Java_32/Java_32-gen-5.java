The task is to find a root of a polynomial given its coefficients. The polynomial is defined by the list of coefficients, where the first coefficient is the constant term, the second coefficient is the coefficient of x, the third coefficient is the coefficient of x^2, and so on.

The function `findZero` takes a list of coefficients as input, and returns a root of the polynomial. The function assumes that the list has an even number of coefficients, and the largest non-zero coefficient is the leading coefficient of the polynomial.

The function uses a simple iterative method to find a root of the polynomial. It starts with an initial guess of 1.0, and then iteratively applies the Newton-Raphson method to improve the guess until the desired precision is reached.

Here is the implementation of the `findZero` function in Java:
```
public double findZero(List<Double> xs) {
    double x0 = 1.0; // initial guess
    double tol = 1e-6; // tolerance
    double x = x0;
    double fx = poly(xs, x0);
    double dx = 1.0; // initial step size
    while (Math.abs(dx) > tol) {
        double fx1 = poly(xs, x);
        dx = fx1 / (fx * (1.0 / (dx * dx)));
        x -= dx;
        fx = fx1;
    }
    return x;
}
```
The `poly` function is used to evaluate the polynomial at a given point. It takes a list of coefficients and a point as input, and returns the value of the polynomial at that point.

The `findZero` function iteratively applies the Newton-Raphson method to find a root of the polynomial. It starts with an initial guess of 1.0, and then iteratively improves the guess until the desired precision is reached.

Here is the implementation of the `poly` function in Java:
```
public double poly(List<Double> xs, double x) {
    double result = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < xs.size(); i++) {
        result += xs.get(i) * Math.pow(x, i);
    }
    return result;
}
```
The `poly` function takes a list of coefficients and a point as input, and returns the value of the polynomial at that point. It does this by iteratively adding the terms of the polynomial, where each term is the product of the corresponding coefficient and
