The task is to create a function that finds the root of a polynomial. The polynomial is given as a list of coefficients, where the first coefficient is the constant term, the second coefficient is the term with the variable, the third coefficient is the term with the variable squared, and so on. The function should return only one root, even if there are multiple roots.

Here is a Python solution for the problem:

```Python
import numpy as np

def find_zero(xs):
    if len(xs) % 2 == 1:
        raise ValueError("List of coefficients must have even length")
    coefficients = np.poly1d(xs)
    root = np.roots(coefficients)[0].real
    return root
```

This function uses the NumPy library to create a polynomial from the list of coefficients, and then uses the `roots` function to find the roots of the polynomial. The `[0].real` part is used to get the real part of the first root, since `roots` returns complex numbers.

The function also checks if the length of the list of coefficients is odd, and raises a `ValueError` if it is, because the task guarantees that the list will have an even number of coefficients. This is because the largest non-zero coefficient guarantees a solution, and the list of coefficients is guaranteed to have an even number of elements.
