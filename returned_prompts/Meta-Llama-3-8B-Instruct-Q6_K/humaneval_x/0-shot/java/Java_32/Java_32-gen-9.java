The problem is asking to implement a function that finds the root of a polynomial equation. The polynomial equation is given as a list of coefficients, where the first element is the constant term, the second element is the coefficient of the linear term, and so on.

The function `findZero` should return the root of the polynomial equation. However, there are some assumptions made in the problem statement. It is assumed that the list of coefficients has an even number of elements and the largest non-zero coefficient is non-zero. This is because the problem statement says that the function only takes lists having even number of coefficients and largest non-zero coefficient as it guarantees a solution.

Here is the implementation of the `findZero` function:

```java
public double findZero(List<Double> xs) {
    double x = -xs.get(1) / 2.0; // Start with an initial guess
    double eps = 1e-6; // Precision
    while (true) {
        double fx = poly(xs, x);
        if (Math.abs(fx) < eps) {
            return x;
        }
        double dx = poly(xs, x + eps) - fx;
        x -= fx / dx;
    }
}
```

This function uses the Newton-Raphson method to find the root of the polynomial equation. It starts with an initial guess for the root, then iteratively updates the guess until it converges to the root with a specified precision.

The `poly` function is used to evaluate the polynomial at a given point `x`. It is implemented as follows:

```java
public double poly(List<Double> xs, double x) {
    double result = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < xs.size(); i++) {
        result += xs.get(i) * Math.pow(x, i);
    }
    return result;
}
```

This function calculates the value of the polynomial at the point `x` by summing the products of each coefficient and the corresponding power of `x`. The powers of `x` are calculated using the `Math.pow` function. The result is the value of the polynomial at the point `x`.
