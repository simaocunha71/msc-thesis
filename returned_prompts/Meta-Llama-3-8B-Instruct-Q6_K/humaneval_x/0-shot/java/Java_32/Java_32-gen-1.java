This is a solution for the problem of finding the root of a polynomial equation using Newton's method for approximating the root. The `poly` function is used to evaluate the polynomial at a given point `x`, and the `findZero` function finds the root of the polynomial using Newton's method.

Here's the solution:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    /**
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x^2 + .... xs[n] * x^n
     */
    public double poly(List<Double> xs, double x) {
        double result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < xs.size(); i++) {
            result += xs.get(i) * Math.pow(x, i);
        }
        return result;
    }
    
    /**
    xs are coefficients of a polynomial.
    findZero find x such that poly(x) = 0.
    findZero returns only only zero point, even if there are many.
    Moreover, findZero only takes list xs having even number of coefficients
    and largest non zero coefficient as it guarantees
    a solution.
    >>> findZero(Arrays.asList(1, 2)) // f(x) = 1 + 2x
    -0.5
    >>> findZero(Arrays.asList(-6, 11, -6, 1)) // (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
    1.0
     */
    public double findZero(List<Double> xs) {
        double x = 1; // initial guess
        double tolerance = 1e-6; // precision
        double maxIters = 1000; // maximum number of iterations
        
        for (int i = 0; i < maxIters; i++) {
            double fx = poly(xs, x);
            if (Math.abs(fx) < tolerance) {
                return x;
            }
            double fxPrime = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < xs.size(); j++) {
                fxPrime += j * xs.get(j) * Math.pow(x, j - 1);
            }
            x = x - fx / fxPrime;
        }
        return x;
    }
}
```
