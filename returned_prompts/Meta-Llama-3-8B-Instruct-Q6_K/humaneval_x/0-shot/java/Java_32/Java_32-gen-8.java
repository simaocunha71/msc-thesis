Here is the Java code for the problem. It uses the Newton-Raphson method to find the root of the polynomial.

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public double findZero(List<Double> xs) {
        if (xs.size() % 2 == 1) {
            throw new RuntimeException("xs must have even number of coefficients");
        }
        double x = 1; // initial guess
        double precision = 0.00001; // precision
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) { // max 1000 iterations
            double fx = poly(xs, x);
            double dfx = polyDerivative(xs, x);
            if (Math.abs(fx) < precision) {
                return x;
            }
            x = x - fx / dfx;
        }
        return x;
    }

    public double poly(List<Double> xs, double x) {
        double result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < xs.size(); i++) {
            result += xs.get(i) * Math.pow(x, i);
        }
        return result;
    }

    public double polyDerivative(List<Double> xs, double x) {
        double result = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < xs.size(); i++) {
            result += i * xs.get(i) * Math.pow(x, i - 1);
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

This code first checks if the input list has an odd number of coefficients. If it does, it throws a `RuntimeException`. Then it uses the Newton-Raphson method to find the root of the polynomial. The method iteratively updates the guess `x` until the precision is reached. The precision is set to `0.00001`. The maximum number of iterations is set to `1000`. If the method does not converge within the maximum number of iterations, it returns the last guess. The `poly` method evaluates the polynomial at a given point, and the `polyDerivative` method evaluates the derivative of the polynomial at a given point. The derivative is used to update the guess in the Newton-Raphson method. The `findZero` method returns the root of the polynomial.
