Here is the solution to the problem. The function findZero() finds the root of the polynomial given by the coefficients in the list xs. It uses the Newton-Raphson method, which is a numerical method for finding successively better approximations to the roots of a real-valued function.

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public double findZero(List<Double> xs) {
        double x = 1.0; // initial guess
        double tol = 1e-6; // tolerance
        double maxIter = 100; // maximum number of iterations

        for (int i = 0; i < maxIter; i++) {
            double p = poly(xs, x); // evaluate the polynomial at x
            if (Math.abs(p) < tol) {
                return x; // we have found a root
            }

            double p_prime = polyDerivative(xs, x); // evaluate the derivative at x
            x = x - p / p_prime; // update the guess using Newton-Raphson
        }

        return x; // we have reached the maximum number of iterations
    }

    public double poly(List<Double> xs, double x) {
        double result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < xs.size(); i++) {
            result += xs.get(i) * Math.pow(x, i);
        }
        return result;
    }

    public double polyDerivative(List<Double> xs, double x) {
        double result = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < xs.size(); i++) {
            result += i * xs.get(i) * Math.pow(x, i - 1);
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

In this solution, the findZero() function first initializes a guess for the root, x. Then it enters a loop, where it evaluates the polynomial at x, and if the result is close to zero, it returns x as the root. Otherwise, it updates the guess using the Newton-Raphson method, which is based on the derivative of the polynomial. The loop continues until the maximum number of iterations is reached. The poly() function evaluates the polynomial at a given point, and the polyDerivative() function evaluates the derivative of the polynomial at a given point. The derivative is calculated by taking the derivative of the polynomial, which is a new polynomial where each coefficient is the derivative of the corresponding coefficient in the original polynomial. The derivative is
