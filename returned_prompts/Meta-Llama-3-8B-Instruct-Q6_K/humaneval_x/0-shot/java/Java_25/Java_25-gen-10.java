S:

The problem is asking to find the prime factors of a given integer and return them as a list in the order from smallest to largest. Each factor should be listed the number of times it appears in the factorization.

We can use a loop to iterate from 2 to the square root of the number. If the number is divisible by the current number, it means that the current number is a factor, so we add it to the result list and divide the number by the current factor. We continue this process until the number is no longer divisible by the current factor.

Finally, if the remaining number is greater than 1, it means that it is a prime number, so we add it to the result list.

Here is the Java code that implements this algorithm:

```java
public List<Integer> factorize(int n) {
    List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();
    int i = 2;
    while (i * i <= n) {
        while (n % i == 0) {
            res.add(i);
            n /= i;
        }
        i++;
    }
    if (n > 1) {
        res.add(n);
    }
    return res;
}
```

This code works by iterating over the numbers from 2 to the square root of the number, and for each number, it checks if it is a factor of the number. If it is, it adds it to the result list and divides the number by the factor. This process continues until the number is no longer divisible by the current factor. If the remaining number is greater than 1, it means that it is a prime number, so it is added to the result list.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(sqrt(n)), where n is the given integer. This is because we are iterating over the numbers from 2 to the square root of the number, and for each number, we are performing a constant amount of work. The space complexity is O(1), because we are using a fixed amount of space to store the result list and the variables.
