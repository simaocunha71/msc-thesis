R:
The task is to write a function that returns a list of prime factors of a given integer. The factors should be listed in the order from smallest to largest, and each factor should be listed the number of times it appears in the factorization. For example, the prime factors of 8 are [2, 2, 2], of 25 are [5, 5], and of 70 are [2, 5, 7].

The solution provided correctly solves the problem. It iterates from 2 to the input number, checks if the current number is a factor of the input number, and if so, it counts the number of times it appears in the factorization and adds it to the result list. The function then returns the result list.

The solution is efficient because it only checks divisibility up to the square root of the input number, which reduces the number of iterations. It also uses a while loop to count the number of times a factor appears in the factorization, which is more efficient than using a for loop.

The solution is also correct because it correctly handles the case where a factor appears more than once in the factorization. For example, the prime factors of 8 are [2, 2, 2], which is correctly handled by the solution.

Overall, the solution is correct, efficient, and easy to understand.  // Correctly solve the problem
