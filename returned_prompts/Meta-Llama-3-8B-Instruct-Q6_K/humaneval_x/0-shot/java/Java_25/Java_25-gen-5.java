Explanation:
The problem is asking to find the prime factors of a given integer `n` and return them in a list. The prime factors should be listed in the order from smallest to largest and each factor should be listed the number of times it appears in the factorization of `n`.

The solution uses a loop from `2` to the square root of `n` to find the prime factors. For each factor `i`, it checks how many times `i` divides `n` by using a while loop. The factor `i` is added to the list `factors` the number of times it appears in the factorization of `n`. If `n` is not fully factored, it means that `n` itself is a prime number, so it is added to the list `factors`.

The time complexity of this solution is O(sqrt(n)) because we are iterating up to the square root of `n`. The space complexity is O(log(n)) because in the worst case, we might need to store all the prime factors of `n` in the list `factors`.
