E:
This problem is about finding all the prime factors of a given integer. The function should return a list of prime factors, each repeated according to how many times it appears in the factorization.
The main idea is to iterate from 2 to the given number and for each number, check if it is a factor of the given number. If it is, then divide the number by the factor and repeat the process until the number is no longer divisible by the factor. This is done to get all the factors of the number.
The problem does not specify whether the output should be sorted or not. However, based on the given examples, it seems that the output should be sorted in ascending order.
The given examples are:
factorize(8) = [2, 2, 2]
factorize(25) = [5, 5]
factorize(70) = [2, 5, 7]
So, the output should be a list of unique prime factors, each repeated according to how many times it appears in the factorization, and sorted in ascending order. 

The first solution provided uses a while loop to repeatedly divide the number by the factor until the number is no longer divisible by the factor. This is done to get all the factors of the number.
The second solution provided adds each factor to the list as many times as it appears in the factorization. This is done to get the correct count of each factor.
The time complexity of both solutions is O(sqrt(n)) because the maximum number of iterations is sqrt(n). The space complexity is O(n) because in the worst case, the list of factors can contain n elements. 

The problem can be solved using a
