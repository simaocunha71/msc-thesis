Solution explanation:
The problem is to find the prime factors of a given integer and return them in a list. The prime factors are the factors that are only divisible by 1 and themselves. For example, the prime factors of 8 are [2, 2, 2], of 25 are [5, 5], and of 70 are [2, 5, 7].

The solution uses a loop to iterate from 2 to the square root of the given integer. For each iteration, it checks if the current number is a factor of the given integer. If it is, it adds the number to the list of factors and divides the given integer by the number. This process continues until the given integer is reduced to 1.

If the given integer is greater than 1 at the end of the loop, it means that the integer is a prime number itself, so it is added to the list of factors.

The time complexity of this solution is O(sqrt(n)), where n is the given integer. This is because the loop iterates up to the square root of the given integer.

The space complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of factors found. This is because the list of factors can contain up to n elements.

The solution is implemented in Java, but it can be easily translated to other programming languages. The input to the function is an integer, and the output is a list of integers representing the prime factors of the input integer. The function is named `factorize`. 

Example usage:

```
System.out.println(factorize(8)); // [2, 2, 2]
System.out.println(factorize(25)); // [5, 5]
System.out.println(factorize(70)); // [2, 5, 7]
```

In this example, the function is called with the integers 8, 25, and 70, and the output is the list of prime factors for each integer.
