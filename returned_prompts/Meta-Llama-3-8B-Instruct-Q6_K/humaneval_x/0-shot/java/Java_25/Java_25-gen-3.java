The output will be [2, 5, 7] because 70 can be factored as 2 * 5 * 7. The function factorize() in the above code will return a list of prime factors of the given integer in the order from smallest to largest. Each of the factors should be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appears in factorization. The input number should be equal to the product of all factors. The time complexity of the above code is O(sqrt(n)) because we are dividing the number by i until it is no longer divisible. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the factors in the list.  // End of Solution
