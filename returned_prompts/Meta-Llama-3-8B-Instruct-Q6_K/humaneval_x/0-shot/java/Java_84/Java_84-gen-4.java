The problem asks you to convert a given positive integer N into its binary representation and then find the sum of its digits. The sum should be represented in binary format as well.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Convert the integer N into its binary string using Integer.toBinaryString(N).
2. Initialize a variable sum to 0.
3. Iterate through each character in the binary string.
4. For each character, subtract the ASCII value of '0' (48) from the character to get the integer value (0 or 1). Add this value to the sum.
5. Convert the sum into its binary string using Integer.toBinaryString(sum).
6. Return the binary string as the result.

Here's the Java code for the above solution:

```java
public String solve(int N) {
    String binary = Integer.toBinaryString(N);
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < binary.length(); i++) {
        sum += binary.charAt(i) - '0';
    }
    String result = Integer.toBinaryString(sum);
    return result;
}
```

This code will correctly solve the problem by converting the integer N into its binary representation, calculating the sum of its digits, and then converting the sum back into its binary representation. The result is then returned as a string.
