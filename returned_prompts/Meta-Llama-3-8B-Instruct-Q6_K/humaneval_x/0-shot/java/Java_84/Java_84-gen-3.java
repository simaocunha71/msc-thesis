S:
The problem is asking to find the total sum of the digits in the binary representation of the given number N. It then returns the binary representation of this sum.

We first convert the given number N to its binary representation using the `Integer.toBinaryString()` method. Then, we iterate through the binary string and add each digit (0 or 1) to the sum. We subtract '0' from the character because '0' has an ASCII value of 48 and '1' has an ASCII value of 49, so subtracting '0' gives us the actual value of the digit.

Finally, we convert the sum back to a binary string using the `Integer.toBinaryString()` method and return it.

For example, for N = 1000, the binary representation is "10000000000". The sum of its digits is 1+0+0+0+0+0+0+0 = 1. The binary representation of 1 is "1", which is the output. Similarly, for N = 150, the binary representation is "11101110" and the sum of its digits is 1+1+1+0+1+1+1+0 = 6. The binary representation of 6 is "110", which is the output.
