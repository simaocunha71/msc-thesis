        int res = 0;
        // Count of n-digit numbers that start with 1
        for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
            res += (int) Math.pow(10, n - 1);
        }
        // Count of n-digit numbers that end with 1
        for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
            res += (int) Math.pow(10, n - 1) * i;
        }
        return res;
    }

}  



Solution:
The problem is asking for the count of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1. 

The approach is to count the number of n-digit positive integers that start with 1 and the number of n-digit positive integers that end with 1, and then add them together.

For the numbers that start with 1, we can consider the first digit as 1 and the remaining (n-1) digits can be any digit from 0 to 9. Therefore, the number of such numbers is 9^(n-1).

For the numbers that end with 1, we can consider the last digit as 1 and the remaining (n-1) digits can be any digit from 0 to 9. Therefore, the number of such numbers is (10^(n-1)) * 1.

The total number of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1 is the sum of these two counts, which is 9^(n-1) + (10^(n-1)) * 1.

Here is the Java code to implement this:

```java
public int startsOneEnds(int n) {
    int res = 0;
    // Count of n-digit numbers that start with 1
    for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
        res += (int) Math.pow(10, n - 1);
    }
    // Count of n-digit numbers that end with 1
    for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
        res += (int) Math.pow(10, n - 1) * i;
    }
    return res;
}
```

This code calculates the total count of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1 and returns the result. The time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the number of digits in the input integer. The space complexity
