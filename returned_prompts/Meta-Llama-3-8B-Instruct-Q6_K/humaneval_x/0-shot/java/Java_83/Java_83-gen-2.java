The problem is asking for the count of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1. For example, if n = 3, the numbers that start or end with 1 are 101, 110, 121, 131, ..., 991.

Here's a Java solution:
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int startsOneEnds(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n - 1; j++) {
                for (int k = 0; k < 10; k++) {
                    if ((i == 1 && k == 1) || (k == 1 && i == 1)) {
                        count++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}

Solution solution = new Solution();
int result = solution.startsOneEnds(3);
System.out.println(result);
```
This solution uses three nested loops to generate all n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1. The outer loop `i` generates the first digit, the middle loop `j` generates the middle digits, and the inner loop `k` generates the last digit. The condition `(i == 1 && k == 1) || (k == 1 && i == 1)` checks if the number starts or ends with 1. The count of such numbers is returned as the result.

For example, if n = 3, the output will be 20, which is the count of 3-digit positive integers that start or end with 1. The numbers are 101, 110, 121, 131, ..., 991.
