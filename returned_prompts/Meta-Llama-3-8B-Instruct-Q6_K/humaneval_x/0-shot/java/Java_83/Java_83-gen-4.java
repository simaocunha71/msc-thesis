S:

The problem is asking to count the numbers of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1.

The given code is using two for loops to generate all possible n-digit numbers and check if they start or end with 1.

However, the code can be optimized by only generating the first and last digits of the n-digit numbers and check if they are 1.

Here is the optimized code:

```java
public int startsOneEnds(int n) {
    int count = 0;
    // count the numbers that start with 1
    for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
        count += 9;
    }
    // count the numbers that end with 1
    for (int i = 10; i <= (int) Math.pow(10, n-1); i++) {
        if (i % 10 == 1) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

In this optimized code, the first loop counts the numbers that start with 1, which is 9 times for each digit from 1 to 9. The second loop counts the numbers that end with 1, which is the numbers from 10 to 10^(n-1) that end with 1.

This optimized code has a time complexity of O(n), which is much faster than the original code.
