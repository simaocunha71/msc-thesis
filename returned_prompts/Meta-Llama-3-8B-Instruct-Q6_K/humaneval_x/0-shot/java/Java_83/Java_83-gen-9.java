        int count = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i <= 9; i++){
            count++;
        }
        for(int i = 1; i < 10; i++){
            for(int j = 0; j < n - 1; j++){
                count++;
            }
        }

    }

S:
The problem asks to find the number of n-digit positive integers that
start or end with 1. For the numbers that start with 1, we have 9 choices for the remaining
digits. For the numbers that end with 1, we have 9 choices for the first n-1 digits.
So, the total count is 9 * (10^(n-1)) + 9 * (10^(n-1)) = 18 * (10^(n-1)).

Here is the Java solution:

```java
class Solution {
    public int startsOneEnds(int n) {
        return 18 * (int)Math.pow(10, n - 1);
    }
}
```

This solution directly calculates the count of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1, without iterating through all the possible numbers. It has a time complexity of O(1), which is more efficient than the original solution.  C++ version of this code:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int startsOneEnds(int n) {
        return 18 * (int)pow(10, n - 1);
    }
};
```

This C++ solution is the same as the Java solution, using the pow function from the cmath library to calculate the power of 10.  Python version of this code:

```python
class Solution:
    def startsOneEnds(self, n):
        return 18 * 10 ** (n - 1)
```

This Python solution is the same as the Java and C++ solutions, using the ** operator to calculate the power of 10.  The time complexity of all these solutions is O(1), which is more efficient than the original solution.  The original solution has a time complexity of O(10^n), which is not efficient for large values of n.  Therefore, the optimized solution is more practical for solving this problem.  The optimized solution is also more concise and easier to understand.  It directly calculates the count of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1, without iterating through all the possible numbers.  This
