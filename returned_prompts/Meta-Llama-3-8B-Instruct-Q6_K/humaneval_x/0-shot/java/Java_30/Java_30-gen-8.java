public List<Integer> getPositive(List<Integer> l) {
    return l.stream()
            .filter(i -> i > 0)
            .collect(Collectors.toList());
}
Output:
[2, 5, 6]
[5, 3, 2, 3, 9, 123, 1]  // For the given test cases


Explanation:
The problem is asking to write a function that filters a list of integers and returns a new list containing only the positive numbers from the original list.

The solution uses the Java 8 Stream API to achieve this. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. `l.stream()`: This creates a stream from the input list `l`.
2. `filter(i -> i > 0)`: This filters the stream to include only the elements that satisfy the condition `i > 0`, i.e., positive numbers.
3. `collect(Collectors.toList())`: This collects the filtered stream into a new list.

The resulting list contains only the positive numbers from the original list. The `getPositive` function returns this new list.  // For the given test cases


Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list. This is because the stream API processes the elements in the list once.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of positive numbers in the input list. This is because the filtered list contains the positive numbers, which may be fewer than the original number of elements in the list.  // For the given test cases


Note: This solution assumes that the input list is not null. If the input list can be null, you should add a null check at the beginning of the function to handle this case.  // For the given test cases
```java
public List<Integer> getPositive(List<Integer> l) {
    if (l == null) {
        return new ArrayList<>();
    }
    return l.stream()
            .filter(i -> i > 0)
            .collect(Collectors.toList());
}
