Explanation:
The fruitDistribution method takes a string and an integer as parameters. It splits the string into words, counts the number of apples and oranges, and then returns the difference between the total number of fruits and the total number of apples and oranges. The method uses a for loop to iterate over the words in the string, and the split method to split the words into substrings. The contains method is used to check if a word contains the substring "apples" or "oranges", and the parseInt method is used to convert the substring to an integer. The method finally returns the result of the subtraction. 

In terms of efficiency, the method has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of words in the string, because it iterates over each word in the string. The space complexity is O(1), because it uses a constant amount of space to store the variables. 

The method can be optimized by using regular expressions to extract the numbers from the string, instead of splitting the string into words and then parsing the substrings. This would reduce the time complexity to O(1), because the regular expression would be evaluated only once. However, this would also make the method more complex and harder to understand. 

For example, the optimized method could be written as follows:

```java
public int fruitDistribution(String s, int n) {
    Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("\\d+");
    Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(s);
    int apples = 0;
    int oranges = 0;
    while (matcher.find()) {
        if (matcher.group().contains("apples")) {
            apples = Integer.parseInt(matcher.group());
        } else if (matcher.group().contains("oranges")) {
            oranges = Integer.parseInt(matcher.group());
        }
    }
    return n - apples - oranges;
}
```

This method uses a regular expression to match the numbers in the string, and then parses the matches
