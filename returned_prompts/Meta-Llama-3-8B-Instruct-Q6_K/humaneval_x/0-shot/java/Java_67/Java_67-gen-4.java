    }  //  Return the difference between the total number of fruits in the basket and the sum of the number of apples and oranges. This will give us the number of mango fruits in the basket.  //  We iterate over the string parts to find the number of apples and oranges. We split each part by " " to get the number and the fruit type. If the part contains "apples" or "oranges", we add the number to the count. Finally, we return the difference between the total number of fruits and the count.  //  For example, if the input string is "5 apples and 6 oranges" and the total number of fruits is 19, we will count 5 apples and 6 oranges, and return 19 - 5 - 6 = 8, which is the number of mango fruits.  //  This solution assumes that the input string is well-formed and that the total number of fruits is an integer.  //  It also assumes that the number of apples and oranges are non-negative integers.  //  The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because we iterate over the string once.  //  The space complexity is O(1), because we use a constant amount of space to store the count and the parts of the string.  //  This solution is efficient and easy to understand, and it works correctly for the given examples.  //  It is also flexible and can handle different input strings and total numbers of fruits.  //  However, it is not robust and may not work correctly for all possible inputs.  //  For example, if the input string is "abc apples" or "5 apples 6 oranges", the solution will not work correctly.  //  To make the solution more robust, we could add input validation and error handling.  //  We could also add more functionality to the solution, such as handling different types of fruits
