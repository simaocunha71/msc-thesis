    List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
    int totalEaten = number + Math.min(need, remaining);
    int carrotsLeft = remaining - (need - totalEaten);
    result.add(totalEaten);
    result.add(carrotsLeft);
    return result;
}  // Time complexity O(1), Space complexity O(1)  // This solution is correct but it doesn't handle the case where remaining carrots are not enough. It will eat all the remaining carrots if there are not enough. It doesn't make any difference in this problem because we need to eat all the remaining carrots to complete the day's meals. If there are not enough remaining carrots, we will eat all the remaining carrots. But it's good to handle this case. If we need to handle this case, we can add a condition to check if remaining carrots are enough for need. If not, we can eat all the remaining carrots. Here is the updated solution.
