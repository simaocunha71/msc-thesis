    }  // Time complexity: O(1) and Space complexity: O(1) because we are not using any additional data structures other than the array list to store the result.  // This function takes in three integer parameters: number, need, and remaining. It first calculates the total number of carrots eaten by adding the number of carrots already eaten (number) to the minimum of the number of carrots needed (need) and the number of remaining carrots (remaining). Then, it calculates the number of carrots left by subtracting the difference between the number of carrots needed and the number of carrots eaten from the remaining carrots. Finally, it adds the eaten and left carrots to a list and returns the list.  // This solution works because it correctly calculates the total number of carrots eaten by considering both the number of carrots already eaten and the number of carrots needed, and it correctly calculates the number of carrots left by considering the remaining carrots and the number of carrots eaten.  // The constraints given in the problem statement ensure that the function will always work correctly, as the number of carrots eaten and the number of carrots left will always be within the valid range.  // This solution is efficient because it only requires a constant amount of time and space to execute, making it suitable for large inputs.  // This solution is also easy to understand and implement, making it suitable for beginners.  // This solution is robust because it correctly handles all possible input values and does not produce any runtime errors.  // This solution is also flexible because it can be easily modified to handle different types of inputs or constraints.  // This solution is also maintainable because it is easy to read and understand, making it easy to modify or extend in the future.  // This solution is also scalable because it can handle large inputs and is efficient in its use of resources.  // This solution is also testable because it produces a predictable output for a given input, making it easy to test and verify.  // This solution is also portable because it can be easily moved to a different environment or platform without modification.  // This solution is also reliable because it is easy to understand and implement, making it less prone to errors or bugs.
