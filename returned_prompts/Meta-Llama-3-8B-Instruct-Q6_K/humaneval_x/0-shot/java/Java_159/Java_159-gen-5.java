```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<Integer> eat(int number, int need, int remaining) {
        int eatMore = need - number;
        int totalEaten = number + eatMore;
        int carrotsLeft = remaining - eatMore;
        if (carrotsLeft < 0) {
            totalEaten += remaining;
            carrotsLeft = 0;
        }
        return Arrays.asList(totalEaten, carrotsLeft);
    }
}
```

This solution calculates the total number of carrots eaten by adding the number of carrots already eaten (`number`) to the number of carrots still needed (`eatMore`). It then calculates the number of carrots left by subtracting the number of carrots still needed from the remaining carrots. If the number of carrots left is negative, it means that all remaining carrots were eaten and the rabbit is still hungry, so the total number of carrots eaten is increased by the remaining carrots and the number of carrots left is set to 0. Finally, it returns a list containing the total number of carrots eaten and the number of carrots left.
