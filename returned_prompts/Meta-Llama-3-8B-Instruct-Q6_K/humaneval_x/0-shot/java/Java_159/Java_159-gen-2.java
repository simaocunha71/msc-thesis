    List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
    int total = number + need;
    int left = remaining - (total - remaining);
    result.add(total);
    result.add(left);
    return result;
}

Explanation:
This problem is asking to create a method that takes three parameters: the number of carrots already eaten, the number of carrots needed, and the remaining number of carrots. The method should return a list containing the total number of carrots eaten after meeting the daily needs and the number of carrots left after meeting the daily needs.

The method first calculates the total number of carrots eaten by adding the number of carrots already eaten and the number of carrots needed. Then, it calculates the number of carrots left by subtracting the total number of carrots eaten from the remaining number of carrots.

For example, if the number of carrots already eaten is 5, the number of carrots needed is 6, and the remaining number of carrots is 10, the method would return a list containing the total number of carrots eaten (5 + 6 = 11) and the number of carrots left (10 - (11 - 10) = 4). If there are not enough remaining carrots, the method would still eat all the remaining carrots but would not be full. The result would be a list containing the total number of carrots eaten and the number of carrots left, which would be 11 and 4, respectively.
