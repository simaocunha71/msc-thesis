        if (b == 0) {
            return a;
        } else {
            return greatestCommonDivisor(b, a % b);
        }
    }

R:
The function `greatestCommonDivisor` takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns their greatest common divisor. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.

The base case of the recursion is when `b` is 0, in which case the GCD is simply `a`. Otherwise, the function calls itself with `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. This process continues until `b` is 0, at which point the GCD is returned.

For example, if the input is `25` and `15`, the function will recursively call itself as follows:

- `greatestCommonDivisor(25, 15)` calls `greatestCommonDivisor(15, 10)`
- `greatestCommonDivisor(15, 10)` calls `greatestCommonDivisor(10, 5)`
- `greatestCommonDivisor(10, 5)` calls `greatestCommonDivisor(5, 0)`
- `greatestCommonDivisor(5, 0)` returns `5`

So the GCD of `25` and `15` is `5`.

The time complexity of this function is O(log min(a, b)) because each recursive call reduces the value of `b` by at least 1, and the value of `b` decreases until it reaches 0. The space complexity is O(log min(a, b)) because of the recursive call stack.
