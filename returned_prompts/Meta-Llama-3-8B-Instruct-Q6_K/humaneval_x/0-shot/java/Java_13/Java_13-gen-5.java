Explanation:
This is an implementation of the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. The algorithm works by repeatedly replacing `a` and `b` with `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, respectively, until `b` is zero. At that point, `a` is the GCD of the original `a` and `b`.

The base case of the recursion is when `b` is zero, in which case the GCD is `a`. Otherwise, the function calls itself with `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. This process continues until `b` is zero, at which point the GCD is returned.

For example, if we call `greatestCommonDivisor(25, 15)`, the function will recursively call itself as follows:

1. `greatestCommonDivisor(25, 15)`: `a = 25`, `b = 15`
2. `greatestCommonDivisor(15, 10)`: `a = 15`, `b = 10`
3. `greatestCommonDivisor(10, 5)`: `a = 10`, `b = 5`
4. `greatestCommonDivisor(5, 0)`: `a = 5`, `b = 0` (base case)
5. Return `a = 5`, which is the GCD of the original `25` and `15`.
