R:
The function greatestCommonDivisor() is a recursive function that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers a and b. It uses the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers.

If b is zero, the GCD is a, so the function returns a. Otherwise, the function calls itself with b and the remainder of a divided by b. This process repeats until b is zero, at which point the GCD is returned.

For example, if we call greatestCommonDivisor(3, 5), the function will recursively call itself as follows:

* greatestCommonDivisor(3, 5) = greatestCommonDivisor(5, 3 % 5) = greatestCommonDivisor(5, 3) = greatestCommonDivisor(3, 2) = greatestCommonDivisor(2, 1) = greatestCommonDivisor(1, 1) = 1

So, the GCD of 3 and 5 is 1.

Similarly, if we call greatestCommonDivisor(25, 15), the function will recursively call itself as follows:

* greatestCommonDivisor(25, 15) = greatestCommonDivisor(15, 10) = greatestCommonDivisor(10, 5) = greatestCommonDivisor(5, 5) = 5

So, the GCD of 25 and 15 is 5.
