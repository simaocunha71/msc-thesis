        if (b == 0) {
            return a;
        } else {
            return greatestCommonDivisor(b, a % b);
        }
    }
}

Explanation:
This Java solution uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers a and b. The GCD is the largest positive integer that divides both a and b without leaving a remainder.

The function `greatestCommonDivisor` takes two integers a and b as input and returns their GCD.

If b is 0, then the GCD is a, because a is the largest positive integer that divides a without leaving a remainder.

Otherwise, the function calls itself with b and the remainder of a divided by b. This is because the GCD of a and b is the same as the GCD of b and the remainder of a divided by b. This process continues until b becomes 0, at which point the GCD is returned as a.

In the given test cases, the GCD of 3 and 5 is 1, and the GCD of 25 and 15 is 5. These results are consistent with the mathematical definitions of GCD.
