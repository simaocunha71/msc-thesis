        if (b == 0) {
            return a;
        } else {
            return greatestCommonDivisor(b, a % b);
        }
    }

Solution Explanation:
This is a recursive solution to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers a and b. The GCD of two integers is the largest integer that divides both of them without leaving a remainder.

The function greatestCommonDivisor takes two integers a and b as input and returns their GCD. If b is 0, then the GCD is a, because a is the largest integer that divides a without leaving a remainder. If b is not 0, then the function recursively calls itself with b and the remainder of a divided by b. This process continues until b is 0, at which point the function returns a, which is the GCD of the original a and b.

For example, if we call greatestCommonDivisor(25, 15), the function will recursively call itself as follows:

* greatestCommonDivisor(25, 15) = greatestCommonDivisor(15, 25 % 15) = greatestCommonDivisor(15, 10) = greatestCommonDivisor(10, 15 % 10) = greatestCommonDivisor(10, 5) = greatestCommonDivisor(5, 10 % 5) = greatestCommonDivisor(5, 0)

At this point, b is 0, so the function returns a, which is 5. Therefore, the GCD of 25 and 15 is 5.

This solution has a time complexity of O(log min(a, b)), because each recursive call reduces the value of b by at least 1, until b is 0. The space complexity is O(log min(a, b)) as well, because of the recursive call stack. .
