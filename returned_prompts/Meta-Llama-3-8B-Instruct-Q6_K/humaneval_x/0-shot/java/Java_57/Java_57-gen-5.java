}  // This program checks if a list of integers is monotonically increasing or decreasing. It uses two boolean variables, inc and dec, to track whether the list is increasing or decreasing. If at any point the list is neither increasing nor decreasing, it returns false. Otherwise, it returns true.

Explanation:
The program defines a method called `monotonic` which takes a list of integers as an argument. It initializes two boolean variables, `inc` and `dec`, to true. These variables are used to track whether the list is increasing or decreasing.

The program then loops through the list, comparing each element to the previous one. If the current element is less than the previous one, it sets `dec` to false. If the current element is greater than the previous one, it sets `inc` to false.

After the loop, the program returns the logical OR of `inc` and `dec`. If the list is either increasing or decreasing, this will be true. If the list is neither increasing nor decreasing, this will be false.

For example, the list `[1, 2, 4, 20]` is monotonically increasing, so the program returns `true`. The list `[1, 20, 4, 10]` is not monotonically increasing or decreasing, so the program returns `false`. The list `[4, 1, 0, -10]` is monotonically decreasing, so the program returns `true`.  // This program checks if a list of integers is monotonically increasing or decreasing. It uses two boolean variables, inc and dec, to track whether the list is increasing or decreasing. If at any point the list is neither increasing nor decreasing, it returns false. Otherwise, it returns true.
