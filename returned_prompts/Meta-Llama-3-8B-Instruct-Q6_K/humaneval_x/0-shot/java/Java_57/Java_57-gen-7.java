Here is the Java code that checks if the elements of a list are monotonically increasing or decreasing.

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static boolean monotonic(List<Integer> l) {
        boolean increasing = true;
        boolean decreasing = true;

        for (int i = 1; i < l.size(); i++) {
            if (l.get(i - 1) > l.get(i)) {
                increasing = false;
            }
            if (l.get(i - 1) < l.get(i)) {
                decreasing = false;
            }
        }

        return increasing || decreasing;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> l1 = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 4, 20);
        List<Integer> l2 = Arrays.asList(1, 20, 4, 10);
        List<Integer> l3 = Arrays.asList(4, 1, 0, -10);

        System.out.println(monotonic(l1));  // true
        System.out.println(monotonic(l2));  // false
        System.out.println(monotonic(l3));  // true
    }
}
```

The code defines a method `monotonic` that takes a list of integers as input. It initializes two boolean variables `increasing` and `decreasing` to `true`. Then it iterates over the list from the second element to the end. If it finds an element that is less than the previous one, it sets `increasing` to `false`. If it finds an element that is greater than the previous one, it sets `decreasing` to `false`. Finally, it returns `increasing` or `decreasing`, whichever is `true`. This ensures that the list is either monotonically increasing or decreasing.

In the `main` method, we create three lists of integers and call the `monotonic` method with each list. The output shows that the first and third lists are monotonically increasing or decreasing, while the second list is not.
