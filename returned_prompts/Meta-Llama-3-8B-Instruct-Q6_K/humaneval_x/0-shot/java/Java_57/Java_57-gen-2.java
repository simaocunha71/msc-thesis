Here is the Java code for the problem:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public boolean monotonic(List<Integer> l) {
        boolean increasing = true;
        boolean decreasing = true;
        for (int i = 1; i < l.size(); i++) {
            if (l.get(i) > l.get(i - 1)) {
                decreasing = false;
            }
            if (l.get(i) < l.get(i - 1)) {
                increasing = false;
            }
        }
        return increasing || decreasing;
    }
}
```

This code defines a method `monotonic` that takes a list of integers as input. It initializes two boolean variables, `increasing` and `decreasing`, to `true`. It then iterates over the list from the second element to the end. For each element, it checks if it is greater than or less than the previous element. If it is greater than the previous element, it sets `decreasing` to `false`. If it is less than the previous element, it sets `increasing` to `false`. Finally, it returns `true` if either `increasing` or `decreasing` is `true`, indicating that the list is either monotonically increasing or decreasing. If both `increasing` and `decreasing` are `false`, it returns `false`, indicating that the list is neither monotonically increasing nor decreasing. 

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the size of the input list. The space complexity is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the two boolean variables. 

This solution works correctly because it checks if the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing, and returns `true` if it is either one of these. It does not check if the list is strictly increasing or decreasing, which is not required by the problem statement. 

Note that the problem statement does not specify whether the list can be empty or not. In this solution, the method will return `true` for an empty list, since an empty list can be considered to be both monotonically increasing and decreasing. If you want to handle the empty list case differently, you can add a special case at the beginning of the method to return `false` or `true` as needed. 

This solution can be further optimized by using a single boolean variable instead of two, and updating it based on the comparison result. However, this would make the
