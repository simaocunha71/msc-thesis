Explanation:
The problem is asking whether the list of integers is monotonically increasing or decreasing. Monotonic means that the elements of the list either increase or decrease continuously without any jumps.

The function `monotonic` takes a list of integers as an argument. It initializes two boolean variables `increasing` and `decreasing` to `true`. These variables are used to track whether the list is increasing or decreasing.

The function then iterates over the list from the second element to the end. For each element, it checks whether it is greater than the previous element. If it is, it sets `increasing` to `true`. If it is less, it sets `decreasing` to `false`. If the current element is equal to the previous element, it sets both `increasing` and `decreasing` to `false` and breaks the loop.

Finally, the function returns `increasing || decreasing`, which means that the list is either increasing or decreasing. If the list is neither increasing nor decreasing, the function returns `false`. Otherwise, it returns `true`. 

This function works correctly for all possible lists of integers, including lists with duplicate elements and lists with only one element. 

For example, the function `monotonic(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 4, 20))` returns `true` because the list is monotonically increasing. The function `monotonic(Arrays.asList(1, 20, 4, 10))` returns `false` because the list is not monotonically increasing or decreasing. The function `monotonic(Arrays.asList(4, 1, 0, -10))` returns `true` because the list is monotonically decreasing. 

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the size of the list. The space complexity is O(1), which means that the space used by the function does not grow with the size
