Here is the Java solution for the problem. This solution uses a simple loop to check if the list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing.

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public boolean monotonic(List<Integer> l) {
        boolean increasing = true;
        boolean decreasing = true;
        for (int i = 1; i < l.size(); i++) {
            if (l.get(i - 1) > l.get(i)) {
                increasing = false;
            }
            if (l.get(i - 1) < l.get(i)) {
                decreasing = false;
            }
        }
        return increasing || decreasing;
    }
}
```
This solution works by iterating over the list and checking if each element is either greater than or less than the previous element. If all elements are in increasing order, the `increasing` flag will be `true`. If all elements are in decreasing order, the `decreasing` flag will be `true`. If either flag is `true`, the function returns `true`, indicating that the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing. If neither flag is `true`, the function returns `false`, indicating that the list is not monotonically increasing or decreasing. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the list, because it needs to iterate over the entire list once. The space complexity is O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the flags.
