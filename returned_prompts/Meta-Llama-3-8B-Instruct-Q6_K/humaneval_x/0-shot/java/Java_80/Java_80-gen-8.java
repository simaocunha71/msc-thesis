    return s.length() >= 3 && new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(s.substring(0, 3).toCharArray())).size() == 3;
}

Explanation:
The problem is asking to check if the given string is happy or not. A string is happy if its length is at least 3 and every 3 consecutive letters are distinct.

In the given solution, the code first checks if the length of the string is at least 3. If not, it returns false. Then, it uses a HashSet to store the distinct characters of the first 3 consecutive letters of the string. If the size of the HashSet is 3, it means every 3 consecutive letters are distinct, so the function returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because it needs to iterate over the string once to check the length and to extract the first 3 consecutive letters. The space complexity is also O(n), as it needs to store the distinct characters of the first 3 consecutive letters in the HashSet.
