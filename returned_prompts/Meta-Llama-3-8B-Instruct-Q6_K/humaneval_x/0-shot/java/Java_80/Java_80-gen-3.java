R:
The provided code is a correct implementation of the problem. It checks if the string is happy by verifying if the length is at least 3 and every 3 consecutive letters are distinct. If any of these conditions fail, the function returns false. If all conditions are met, it returns true.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. `if(s.length() < 3)`: This checks if the length of the string is less than 3. If it is, the function returns false because a string with a length less than 3 cannot be happy.

2. `for(int i = 0; i < s.length() - 2; i++)`: This loop iterates over the string, considering each character and the two characters that follow it.

3. `if(s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(i+1) || s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(i+2) || s.charAt(i+1) == s.charAt(i+2))`: This checks if any of the three consecutive characters are the same. If they are, the function returns false because the string is not happy.

4. If the loop completes without finding any duplicate characters, the function returns true, indicating that the string is happy.

This implementation is efficient because it only checks for duplicates within a window of 3 characters. It does not need to check for duplicates across the entire string, making it a linear-time solution.
