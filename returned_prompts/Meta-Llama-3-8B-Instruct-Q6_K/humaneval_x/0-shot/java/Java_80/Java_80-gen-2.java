            if (s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(i + 1) || s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(i + 2) || s.charAt(i + 1) == s.charAt(i + 2)) {

Explanation:
The problem is asking to check if a given string is happy or not. A string is happy if its length is at least 3 and every 3 consecutive letters are distinct.

In the given solution, we first check if the length of the string is less than 3. If it is, we return false because a string with less than 3 characters cannot be happy.

Then, we use a for loop to iterate over the string. We check if the current character is the same as the next two characters or if the next two characters are the same. If we find any pair of characters that are the same, we return false because the string is not happy.

If we don't find any pair of characters that are the same, we return true because the string is happy. This is because we have checked all possible combinations of 3 consecutive characters and they are all distinct. Therefore, the string meets the condition of being happy.
