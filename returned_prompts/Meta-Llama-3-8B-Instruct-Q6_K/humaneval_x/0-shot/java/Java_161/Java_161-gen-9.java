        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (Character.isLetter(c)) {
                sb.append(Character.toUpperCase(c));
            } else {
                sb.append(c);
            }
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
S:
The problem is asking to reverse the case of letters in the given string and if the string contains no letters, reverse the string. 

In the solution above, a StringBuilder is used to build the resulted string. For each character in the string, if it's a letter, it's converted to upper case and appended to the StringBuilder. If it's not a letter, it's appended as it is. 

Finally, the StringBuilder is converted to a string and returned. 

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string, because we're iterating over the string once. The space complexity is also O(n), because in the worst case, we're building a new string of the same length.
