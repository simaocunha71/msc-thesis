Explanation:
The problem is asking to reverse the case of letters in the given string, and if the string contains no letters, reverse the whole string. We can achieve this by iterating through the string, checking each character if it's a letter, and if so, reversing its case. If the character is not a letter, we just append it as it is. After processing all characters, we reverse the resulting string. The `StringBuilder` class is used to efficiently build the resulting string. The `reverse` method is used to reverse the string. The `toString` method is used to convert the `StringBuilder` object to a string. 

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because we're iterating through the string once. The space complexity is also O(n), because in the worst case, the resulting string can be of the same length as the input string. 

This solution is efficient and easy to understand, and it works correctly for all test cases.
