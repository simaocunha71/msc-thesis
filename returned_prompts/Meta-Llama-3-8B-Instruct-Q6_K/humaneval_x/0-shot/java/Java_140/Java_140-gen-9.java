Explanation:
This function iterates over each character in the input string. If the character is a space, it checks if the previous character is also a space. If it is, it checks if the character before that is also a space. If it is, it replaces the space with a hyphen (-). Otherwise, it replaces the space with an underscore (_). If the character is not a space, it simply appends the character to the result string. The function returns the resulting string. 

For example, for the input string "Example   3", the function would iterate over the characters as follows:
- 'E' is not a space, so it is appended to the result string.
- 'x' is not a space, so it is appended to the result string.
- 'a' is not a space, so it is appended to the result string.
- 'm' is not a space, so it is appended to the result string.
- 'p' is not a space, so it is appended to the result string.
- 'l' is not a space, so it is appended to the result string.
- 'e' is not a space, so it is appended to the result string.
- ' ' is a space, and the previous character is also a space, so it is replaced with a hyphen (-).
- '3' is not a space, so it is appended to the result string.

The resulting string would be "_Example-3".
