Explanation:
We use the `Collections.sort()` method and provide a custom comparator to sort the array. The comparator compares two integers `a` and `b` by counting the number of ones in their binary representation using the `Integer.bitCount()` method. If the number of ones is the same, it compares the decimal values using the `Integer.compare()` method. This way, the array is sorted according to the number of ones in their binary representation in ascending order, and for similar number of ones, it is sorted based on decimal value. 

The `Integer.bitCount()` method returns the number of one-bits in the binary representation of the specified integer. This method is more efficient than counting the number of ones manually. 

The `Integer.compare()` method returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as the first argument is less than, equal to, or greater than the second. 

This solution works for both positive and negative integers. For negative integers, the `Integer.bitCount()` method returns the number of one-bits in the binary representation of the absolute value of the integer. The sorting is done based on the absolute value of the integers. 

The `sortArray()` method returns the sorted list of integers. 

The unit tests provided ensure that the solution works correctly for different input arrays.
