Explanation:
This problem is about calculating the nth element of the fib4 sequence. The fib4 sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but it has a different recurrence relation: fib4(n) = fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4).

The solution uses dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the nth element of the fib4 sequence. It first initializes an array of size n+1 with the base cases of the fib4 sequence. Then, it iterates from 3 to n, and for each i, it calculates fib4(i) as the sum of fib4(i-1), fib4(i-2), fib4(i-3), and fib4(i-4). Finally, it returns the nth element of the fib4 sequence.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), and the space complexity is O(n), where n is the input number. This solution is efficient because it avoids the use of recursion and uses a loop to iterate over the sequence.
