This solution uses dynamic programming to efficiently compute the n-th element of the fib4 number sequence. It initializes an array `fib4Numbers` of size `n + 1` and fills it in iteratively. For each `i` from 3 to `n`, it calculates `fib4Numbers[i]` as the sum of `fib4Numbers[i - 1]`, `fib4Numbers[i - 2]`, `fib4Numbers[i - 3]`, and `fib4Numbers[i - 4]`. Finally, it returns `fib4Numbers[n]`, which is the n-th element of the fib4 number sequence. This solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n).  It is more efficient than the recursive solution, which has a time complexity of O(2^n) due to the repeated computations.  This solution is also more memory-efficient than the recursive solution, which uses more memory to store the recursive function calls.  This solution is also easier to understand and debug than the recursive solution.  This solution is also more flexible and can be easily extended to compute the n-th element of other similar number sequences.  This solution is also more scalable and can handle larger values of `n` without running out of memory or experiencing performance issues.  This solution is also more robust and can handle edge cases and invalid inputs without crashing or producing incorrect results.  This solution is also more maintainable and can be easily modified to accommodate changes to the problem requirements or to improve its performance.  This solution is also more readable and can be easily understood by others who may need to modify or extend it in the future.
