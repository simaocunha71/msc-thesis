public String decimalToBinary(int decimal) {
    String binary = Integer.toBinaryString(decimal);
    return "db" + binary + "db";
}
// Example: decimalToBinary(15) returns "db1111db" because 15 in decimal is 1111 in binary. 

Explanation: 
The problem is asking you to convert an integer to its binary representation and return it as a string with 'db' prepended and appended.

In Java, you can use the Integer.toBinaryString(int i) method to convert an integer to its binary representation as a string.

The method "decimalToBinary" takes an integer as input, converts it to binary using the toBinaryString method, and then prepends and appends 'db' to the result.

For example, if you call decimalToBinary(15), it will return "db1111db" because 15 in decimal is 1111 in binary. 

The time complexity is O(1) because the conversion to binary is a constant time operation. The space complexity is also O(1) because the output string is of fixed length.
