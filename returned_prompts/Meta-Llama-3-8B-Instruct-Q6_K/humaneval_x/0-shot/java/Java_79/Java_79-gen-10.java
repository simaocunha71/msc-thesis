        // Your code here
        return "db" + Integer.toBinaryString(decimal) + "db";
    }
}

Explanation:
The problem is asking to convert a given decimal number to binary format. The binary format should be returned as a string with each character representing a binary number, which can be either '0' or '1'. 

The given examples clarify that there are extra characters 'db' at the beginning and at the end of the string. 

In the solution, we use the built-in method `Integer.toBinaryString(decimal)` to convert the decimal number to a binary string. This method returns a string representing the binary representation of the given decimal number. 

Then, we concatenate the 'db' characters at the beginning and at the end of the binary string to get the final result. 

So, the solution is quite simple and straightforward, and it works correctly for the given examples.
