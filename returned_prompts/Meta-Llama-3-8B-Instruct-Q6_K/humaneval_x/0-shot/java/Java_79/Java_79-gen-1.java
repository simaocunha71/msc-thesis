The problem is asking to convert a given decimal number to binary format and return it as a string. The binary representation should be prefixed with "db" and suffixed with "db" for formatting purposes.

Here is a Java solution for the problem:

```java
public String decimalToBinary(int decimal) {
    return "db" + Integer.toBinaryString(decimal) + "db";
}
```

This solution uses the `Integer.toBinaryString()` method to convert the decimal number to binary and then concatenates it with "db" at the beginning and end. The `Integer.toBinaryString()` method returns a string representing the binary representation of the given decimal number. The binary string is then prefixed with "db" and suffixed with "db" as per the problem requirements.
