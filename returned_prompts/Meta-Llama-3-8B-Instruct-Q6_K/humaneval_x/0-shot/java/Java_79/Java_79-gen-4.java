        // Convert decimal number to binary
        StringBuilder binary = new StringBuilder();
        binary.append("db"); // Add extra characters as per the problem statement
        while (decimal > 0) {
            binary.append((decimal & 1) == 1 ? '1' : '0'); // Use bitwise AND to get the last bit
            decimal = decimal >> 1; // Right shift the decimal number by 1 bit
        }
        binary.append("db"); // Add extra characters as per the problem statement

S:
The problem is asking to convert a decimal number to binary format. The binary string will have 'db' at the beginning and at the end.

The given solution uses a StringBuilder to build the binary string. It starts by appending 'db' to the StringBuilder. Then it enters a while loop which continues until the decimal number becomes 0.

Inside the loop, it uses bitwise AND operation to get the last bit of the decimal number. If the result is 1, it appends '1' to the StringBuilder, otherwise it appends '0'. Then it right shifts the decimal number by 1 bit to move to the next bit.

After the loop, it appends 'db' again to the StringBuilder and returns the binary string as a string. This solution is efficient and easy to understand. It also handles the extra characters 'db' as per the problem statement.
