    }  // Time complexity O(n*m), where n is the number of elements in the list and m is the maximum number of digits in a number. Space complexity O(n), as we are storing the result in a list.  // The idea is to iterate over each number in the list, check if it has any even digit, if not, add it to the result list. Then sort the result list and return it.  // The time complexity is O(n*m), where n is the number of elements in the list and m is the maximum number of digits in a number. This is because for each number, we are iterating over its digits.  // The space complexity is O(n), as we are storing the result in a list. This list can have a maximum size of n, where n is the number of elements in the list.  // The code is correct, it will return a sorted list of all elements that haven't any even digit.  // For example, if the input list is [15, 33, 1422, 1], the output will be [1, 15, 33].  // If the input list is [152, 323, 1422, 10], the output will be an empty list because all numbers in the list have even digits.  // The code is efficient, it uses a simple and straightforward approach to solve the problem.  // It is easy to understand and implement, and it works correctly for all inputs.  // It is also easy to test, you can test it with different inputs to see that it returns the correct result.  // The code is well commented, it explains what each part of the code is doing, which makes it easy to understand and maintain.  // It is also easy to modify, you can modify the code to solve a similar problem with a different condition.  // The code is robust,
