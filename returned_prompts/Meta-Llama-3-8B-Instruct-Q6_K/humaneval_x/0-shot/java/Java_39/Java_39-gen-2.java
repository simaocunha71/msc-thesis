The code is a Java implementation of a function that returns the nth Fibonacci number that is also a prime number. The function first generates the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term, and then checks each term to see if it is prime. If a prime Fibonacci number is found, the function returns it. If no prime Fibonacci number is found within the range, the function returns -1.

Here is the breakdown of the code:

1. The function `primeFib` takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the nth Fibonacci number to be found.
2. The function initializes an array `fib` of size `n+1` to store the Fibonacci sequence.
3. The function sets the first two elements of the Fibonacci sequence to 1, as they are the base cases.
4. The function then iterates from 3 to `n` and calculates each Fibonacci number as the sum of the previous two numbers.
5. The function then iterates from 3 to `n` and checks each Fibonacci number to see if it is prime using the `isPrime` function.
6. If a prime Fibonacci number is found, the function returns it.
7. If no prime Fibonacci number is found within the range, the function returns -1.

The `isPrime` function checks if a given number `n` is prime by iterating from 2 to the square root of `n` and checking if `n` is divisible by any of these numbers. If `n` is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is considered prime and the function returns `true`. If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime and the function returns `
