S:

The problem is asking to find the nth Fibonacci number that is also prime. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. We start with the first two Fibonacci numbers, 0 and 1, and then generate the next number by adding the previous two. We keep track of the count of the generated Fibonacci numbers and stop when we reach the nth number that is also prime.

To check if a number is prime, we use a helper function `isPrime` that checks if the number has any divisors other than 1 and itself. If the number is less than or equal to 1, it is not prime. We then check if the number is divisible by any number up to its square root. If it is, it is not prime. Otherwise, it is prime.

In the `primeFib` function, we start with the first two Fibonacci numbers, `a` and `b`, and then generate the next number by adding `a` and `b`. We increment the count each time we generate a new Fibonacci number. We check if the new number is prime by calling the `isPrime` function. If it is, we increment the count again. We repeat this process until we reach the nth number that is also prime. We then return this number.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n * sqrt(n)) because we are checking if each Fibonacci number is prime, and the time complexity of the `isPrime` function is O(sqrt(n)). The space complexity is O(1) because we are using a constant amount of space to store the Fibonacci numbers and the count. S:
