            if (maxHeap.size() > k) {
                maxHeap.poll();
            }
        }

        // Create a list to store the result
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();

        // Add all elements from the priority queue to the result list
        while (!maxHeap.isEmpty()) {
            result.add(maxHeap.poll());

        // Return the result list
        return result;
    }
}

In this solution, we use a priority queue to store the top k elements from the array. The priority queue is implemented using a max heap, where the maximum element is at the top. We add all elements from the array to the priority queue, and if the size of the queue exceeds k, we remove the smallest element (which is the maximum element in the queue). Finally, we add all elements from the priority queue to a result list and return it.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n log k), where n is the length of the array and k is the value of the parameter. This is because we add all elements from the array to the priority queue, which takes O(n) time, and then we remove the smallest element k times, which takes O(k log k) time. The space complexity is O(k), which is the maximum size of the priority queue.

This solution is efficient because it uses a priority queue to store the top k elements, which allows us to find the maximum k elements in the array in a single pass. It also uses a max heap to store the elements, which allows us to add and remove elements efficiently. Overall, this solution is suitable for large arrays and high values of k.
