        // Sort the array in descending order
        Collections.sort(arr, Collections.reverseOrder());

Explanation:
The problem is asking to return a sorted list of length k with the maximum k numbers in the given array. To solve this, we can first sort the array in descending order, and then return the top k elements.

In the solution above, we use the `Collections.sort()` method to sort the array in descending order. We then use the `subList()` method to return the top k elements.

Note that the `subList()` method returns a view of the specified range of the list. In this case, we pass `0` as the starting index and `k` as the ending index, which returns the top k elements of the sorted array.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the length of the array. The space complexity is O(1) as we only use a constant amount of space to store the result.
