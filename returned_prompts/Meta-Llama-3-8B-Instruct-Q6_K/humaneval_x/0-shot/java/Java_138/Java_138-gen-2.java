Explanation:
This problem is about checking whether a given number can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. 

The solution is using a brute force approach with four nested loops. Each loop iterates from 2 to the given number, incrementing by 2 each time to ensure that only even numbers are considered. 

Inside the loops, the sum of the four numbers is checked against the given number. If the sum matches the given number, the method returns true. If the loops complete without finding a match, the method returns false. 

This approach is not efficient for large numbers as it has a time complexity of O(n^4). For smaller numbers, this approach may work fine. However, for larger numbers, a more efficient approach would be needed. 

In this code, the variable i, j, k, l are used to represent the four even numbers. The loops iterate over all possible combinations of these numbers and check if their sum is equal to the given number. If a match is found, the method returns true. If no match is found after checking all combinations, the method returns false. 

This code is a simple and straightforward implementation of the problem. However, as mentioned earlier, it may not be efficient for large numbers. A more efficient solution would be needed for larger numbers. 

The time complexity of this code is O(n^4), where n is the given number. This is because there are four nested loops, each of which iterates up to n. The space complexity is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the variables and the given number. 

The code is written in Java. It uses the for loop to iterate over the numbers and the if statement to check if the sum of the four numbers is equal to the given number. The return statement is used to return the result of the method. 

The method is named isEqualToSumEven and it takes an integer as input. It returns
