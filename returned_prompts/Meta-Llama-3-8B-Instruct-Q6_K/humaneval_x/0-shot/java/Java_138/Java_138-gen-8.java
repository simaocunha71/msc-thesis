Solution:

The given problem can be solved by checking if the given number `n` can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. 

The approach is to create a set of even numbers from 2 to `n` and then iterate over the set to find a combination of 4 even numbers that sum up to `n`.

Here is the optimized solution:

```java
public boolean isEqualToSumEven(int n) {
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i += 2) {
        for (int j = i; j <= n; j += 2) {
            for (int k = j; k <= n; k += 2) {
                for (int l = k; l <= n; l += 2) {
                    if (i + j + k + l == n) {
                        return true;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) as it iterates over the set of even numbers and checks for the sum of 4 even numbers. The space complexity is O(1) as it uses a constant amount of space to store the variables. 

This solution is more efficient than the original solution as it avoids creating a set and using a set iterator. It directly iterates over the set of even numbers and checks for the sum of 4 even numbers. 

However, it's worth noting that this problem can be solved more efficiently using a different approach, such as generating all combinations of 4 even numbers and checking if their sum is equal to `n`. This approach
