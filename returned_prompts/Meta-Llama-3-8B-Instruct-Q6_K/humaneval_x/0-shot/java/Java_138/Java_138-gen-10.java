C:
    public boolean isEqualToSumEven(int n) {
        for(int i = 2; i <= n; i += 2) {
            int sum = 0;
            for(int j = i; j <= n; j += 2) {
                sum += j;
                if(sum == n) {
                    return true;
                }
                if(sum > n) {
                    break;
                }
            }

A.  This solution iterates through all even numbers up to n, and for each even number, it calculates the sum of all even numbers starting from that even number. If the sum equals n, it returns true. If it finds more than one sum equal to n, it will return true for the first sum and break the loop. If it does not find any sum equal to n, it will return false.

C. This solution uses a brute force approach. It iterates through all even numbers up to n, and for each even number, it calculates the sum of all even numbers starting from that even number. If the sum equals n, it returns true. If it does not find any sum equal to n after iterating through all even numbers, it returns false. This solution is less efficient than the previous one as it uses more iterations.

The time complexity of A is O(n) and C is O(n^2).

The space complexity of both solutions is O(1).  // 2
