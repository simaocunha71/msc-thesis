                        }
                    }

R:
The problem can be solved by checking if the given number n is even and greater than or equal to 8. If not, it's not possible to write n as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. 

Here is the corrected code:

```java
public boolean isEqualToSumEven(int n) {
    if (n % 2 != 0 || n < 8) {
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

In this solution, we use a simple if-statement to check if the number is even and greater than or equal to 8. If it is, we return true, otherwise, we return false. This solution is more efficient and easier to understand than the original code. 

The original code had a time complexity of O(n^4) because it was checking all possible combinations of 4 even numbers, which is not necessary. The corrected code has a time complexity of O(1) because it only checks a single condition. 

This solution is also more robust because it handles edge cases correctly. For example, it correctly returns false for odd numbers and numbers less than 8. 

Overall, the corrected code is a more efficient, easier to understand, and more robust solution to the problem.
