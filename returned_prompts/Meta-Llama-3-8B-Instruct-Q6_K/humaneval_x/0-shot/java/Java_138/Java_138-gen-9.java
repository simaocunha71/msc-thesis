Explanation:
This problem is asking to check whether the given number n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. The given code is trying to solve this problem by using nested loops to find four even numbers that sum up to n. However, this code has a major issue - it will not terminate for large values of n because it has a time complexity of O(n^4).

A better solution would be to use a single loop and check for divisibility by 4. If the number is divisible by 4, it means it can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. Here is the corrected code:

```java
public boolean isEqualToSumEven(int n) {
    if (n % 4 != 0) {
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```
This code will return false for all numbers that are not divisible by 4 and true for all numbers that are divisible by 4. This is because a number is divisible by 4 if and only if it can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. This solution has a time complexity of O(1), making it much more efficient than the original code.
