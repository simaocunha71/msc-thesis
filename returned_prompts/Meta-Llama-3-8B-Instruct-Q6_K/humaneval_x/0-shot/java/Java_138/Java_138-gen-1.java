Explanation:
The code checks whether the given number n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers.

The outer loop starts from 2 and goes up to n with a step of 2, which means it checks all even numbers from 2 to n.

The inner loop also starts from 2 and goes up to n with a step of 2, which means it checks all even numbers from 2 to n.

The inner loop sums up the even numbers and checks if the sum equals to n. If it does, it returns true. If the sum exceeds n, it breaks the inner loop and moves to the next iteration of the outer loop.

If the outer loop finishes without finding a combination that sums up to n, it returns false, indicating that n cannot be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers.
