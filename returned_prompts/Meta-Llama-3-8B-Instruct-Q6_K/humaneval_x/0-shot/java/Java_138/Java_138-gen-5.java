The code provided is a solution to the problem of checking whether a given number can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers.

Here is the explanation of the code:

1. The function `isEqualToSumEven(int n)` takes an integer `n` as input.
2. The function first checks if `n` is even by using the modulo operator (`%`). If `n` is even, the function returns `true`.
3. If `n` is not even, the function iterates from 2 to `n` in steps of 2 (i.e., it only considers even numbers) and checks if `n` is equal to any of these numbers. If `n` is equal to one of these numbers, the function returns `true`.
4. If `n` is not equal to any of these numbers, the function returns `false`.

However, there is a more efficient way to solve this problem. We can use a loop to iterate from 2 to `n` in steps of 2 and check if `n` is equal to the sum of 4 even numbers. Here is the modified code:

```java
public boolean isEqualToSumEven(int n) {
    for(int i = 2; i <= n; i += 2) {
        int sum = 0;
        for(int j = 2; j <= n; j += 2) {
            sum += j;
            if(sum == n) {
                return true;
            }
            if(sum > n) {
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

In this code, we iterate from 2 to `n` in steps of 2 and for each even number `i`, we iterate from 2 to `n` in steps of 2 and check if `n` is equal to the sum of these even numbers. If `n` is equal to the sum of 4 even numbers, the function returns `true`. If `n` is not equal to the sum of 4 even numbers, the function returns `false`. This code is more efficient than the original code because it only iterates over the numbers once instead of iterating over the numbers twice.
