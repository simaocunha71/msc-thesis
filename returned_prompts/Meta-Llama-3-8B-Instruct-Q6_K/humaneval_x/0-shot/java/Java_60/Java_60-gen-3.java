Explanation:
The problem is to write a function that calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to n. This is a classic problem and the solution is well-known. The sum of all numbers from 1 to n is given by the formula n*(n+1)/2.

The given solution A and B are correct but they have a time complexity of O(n) because they use a for loop to iterate from 1 to n. The time complexity can be improved to O(1) by using the formula n*(n+1)/2.

The given solution C, D, E are also correct and they all use the formula n*(n+1)/2 to calculate the sum. The time complexity is O(1) and the space complexity is O(1) because no extra space is used.
