S:
The code provided is a Java program that calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to a given integer 'n'. The function sumToN(int n) takes an integer 'n' as an argument and returns the sum of all numbers from 1 to 'n'. This is a simple example of a mathematical problem where the sum of natural numbers up to 'n' is calculated.

Here is a breakdown of how the code works:

1. The function sumToN(int n) is defined to take an integer 'n' as an argument.
2. The variable 'sum' is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the sum of all numbers from 1 to 'n'.
3. The for loop starts from 1 and goes up to 'n' (inclusive). For each iteration, the value of 'i' is added to 'sum'.
4. After the loop finishes, the function returns the value of 'sum', which is the sum of all numbers from 1 to 'n'.

For example, if you call sumToN(5), the function will return 15, which is the sum of all numbers from 1 to 5 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15). Similarly, sumToN(10) will return 55, which is the sum of all numbers from 1 to 10 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 55).

This code is a simple and straightforward solution to the problem, and it works efficiently for small values of 'n'. However, for larger values of 'n', this code may not be efficient due to its O(n) time complexity. In such cases, you might want to consider using a more efficient algorithm, such as the formula for the sum of natural numbers up to 'n', which is n*(n+1)/2.
