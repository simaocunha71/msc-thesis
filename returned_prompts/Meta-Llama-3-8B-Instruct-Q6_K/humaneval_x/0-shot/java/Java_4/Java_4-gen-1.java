}A) The code uses a for loop to calculate the sum of the mean and the sum of the absolute differences between each number and the mean. It then returns the sum of the absolute differences divided by the size of the list, which is the mean absolute deviation.

B) The code first calculates the mean of the list of numbers by summing all the numbers and dividing by the size of the list. Then, it calculates the sum of the absolute differences between each number and the mean. Finally, it returns the sum of the absolute differences divided by the size of the list.

C) The code uses a for loop to calculate the sum of the absolute differences between each number and the mean. It then returns the sum of the absolute differences divided by the size of the list, which is the mean absolute deviation.

D) The code calculates the mean of the list of numbers by summing all the numbers and dividing by the size of the list. Then, it returns the mean as the mean absolute deviation.

Correct Answer: B) The code first calculates the mean of the list of numbers by summing all the numbers and dividing by the size of the list. Then, it calculates the sum of the absolute differences between each number and the mean. Finally, it returns the sum of the absolute differences divided by the size of the list.
