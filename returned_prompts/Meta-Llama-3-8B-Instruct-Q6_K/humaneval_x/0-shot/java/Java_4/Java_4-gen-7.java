Explanation:
The problem requires calculating the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) around the mean of a given list of numbers. MAD is the average absolute difference between each element and the mean.

Here is a step-by-step solution:
1. Calculate the mean of the given list of numbers.
2. Initialize a variable `sum` to 0.0, which will be used to calculate the sum of absolute differences between each element and the mean.
3. Iterate over the list of numbers, and for each number, add it to the `mean` variable to calculate the mean.
4. Calculate the mean by dividing the sum of numbers by the size of the list.
5. Iterate over the list of numbers again, and for each number, calculate the absolute difference between the number and the mean.
6. Add the absolute difference to the `sum` variable.
7. Calculate the MAD by dividing the `sum` by the size of the list.

Note: The `Math.abs` function is used to calculate the absolute value of a number, and the `numbers.size()` function is used to get the size of the list.
