This code calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of a list of numbers. The MAD is a measure of the average absolute difference between each element in the list and the mean of the list. The code first calculates the mean of the list, then calculates the absolute deviations from the mean, and finally calculates the MAD by dividing the sum of the absolute deviations by the size of the list. The result is the average absolute difference between each element and the mean of the list.
