Explanation:
The given code implements a method named `meanAbsoluteDeviation` which calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of a given list of numbers.

The MAD is calculated by first calculating the mean of the numbers, then calculating the absolute difference between each number and the mean, and finally calculating the average of these absolute differences.

In the provided code, the mean is calculated by summing up all the numbers and dividing by the count of numbers. The sum of absolute deviations is calculated by summing up the absolute differences between each number and the mean. The MAD is then calculated by dividing the sum of absolute deviations by the count of numbers.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list, because it performs a single pass through the list to calculate the mean and another pass to calculate the sum of absolute deviations. The space complexity is O(1), because it uses a constant amount of space to store the sum, mean, and count variables.
