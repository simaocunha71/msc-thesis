Here is the solution in Java:
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int skjkasdkd(List<Integer> lst) {
        int maxPrime = 0;
        for (int num : lst) {
            if (isPrime(num) && num > maxPrime) {
                maxPrime = num;
            }
        }
        if (maxPrime == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        int sumOfDigits = 0;
        while (maxPrime > 0) {
            sumOfDigits += maxPrime % 10;
            maxPrime /= 10;
        }
        return sumOfDigits;
    }

    public boolean isPrime(int num) {
        if (num <= 1) {
            return false;
        }
        for (int i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(num); i++) {
            if (num % i == 0) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
This solution iterates through the list of integers to find the largest prime number. It then calculates the sum of the digits of the largest prime number. The `isPrime` method is used to check if a number is prime.

Here's an explanation of the code:

1. The `skjkasdkd` method iterates through the list of integers and finds the largest prime number using a helper method `isPrime`.
2. If the largest prime number is 0, the method returns 0.
3. The method then calculates the sum of the digits of the largest prime number by repeatedly dividing the number by 10 and adding the remainder to a running total.
4. The `isPrime` method checks if a number is prime by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number and checking if the number is divisible by any of the values in that range. If it is, the method returns false. Otherwise, it returns true.

Note that the `isPrime` method uses a simple trial division method to check for primality, which is not the most efficient method for large numbers. For larger inputs, a more efficient primality test such as the Miller-Rabin primality test may be needed.
