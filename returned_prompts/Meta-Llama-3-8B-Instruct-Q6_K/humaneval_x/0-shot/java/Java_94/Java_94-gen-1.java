The problem is asking to find the largest prime number in the given list and then return the sum of its digits.

Here is the Java solution for the problem:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int skjkasdkd(List<Integer> lst) {
        int maxPrime = -1;
        for (int num : lst) {
            if (isPrime(num) && num > maxPrime) {
                maxPrime = num;
            }
        }
        if (maxPrime == -1) {
            return -1;
        }
        int sum = 0;
        while (maxPrime > 0) {
            sum += maxPrime % 10;
            maxPrime /= 10;
        }
        return sum;
    }

    public boolean isPrime(int n) {
        if (n <= 1) {
            return false;
        }
        for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {
            if (n % i == 0) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

In this solution, we first iterate over the list to find the largest prime number. If no prime number is found, we return -1. Then, we calculate the sum of the digits of the largest prime number by repeatedly taking the remainder of the number when divided by 10 and adding it to the sum, and then dividing the number by 10. Finally, we return the sum. The isPrime method checks if a number is prime by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number and checking if the number is divisible by any of the numbers in that range. If it is, the number is not prime, and we return false. If the number is not divisible by any of the numbers in that range, we return true.  ](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-find-largest-prime-number-list-numbers/)

This solution has a time complexity of O(n * sqrt(m)), where n is the size of the list and m is the maximum number in the list. The space complexity is O(1), as we are using a constant amount of space to store the variables. ](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-find-largest-prime-number-list-numbers/) ](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-find-largest-prime-number-list-numbers/) ](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-find-largest-prime-number-list
