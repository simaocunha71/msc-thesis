The problem is asking you to convert a given integer `x` to a new base `base` which is less than 10. The result should be a string representation of the converted number.

Here is a simple solution for this problem in Java:

```java
public String changeBase(int x, int base) {
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    while (x > 0) {
        int remainder = x % base;
        if (remainder > 9) {
            sb.append((char) (remainder + 55)); // Convert 10-15 to A-F
        } else {
            sb.append(remainder);
        }
        x /= base;
    }
    return sb.reverse().toString();
}
```

This solution works by repeatedly dividing the input number `x` by the base `base` and appending the remainder to the result string. If the remainder is greater than 9, it converts the remainder to its corresponding letter (A-F) by adding 55 to the remainder and casting it to a character. Finally, it reverses the result string and returns it.

For example, if you call `changeBase(8, 3)`, the function will return `"22"`, which is the base-3 representation of the number 8. If you call `changeBase(8, 2)`, the function will return `"1000"`, which is the base-2 representation of the number 8. If you call `changeBase(7, 2)`, the function will return `"111"`, which is the base-2 representation of the number 7.
