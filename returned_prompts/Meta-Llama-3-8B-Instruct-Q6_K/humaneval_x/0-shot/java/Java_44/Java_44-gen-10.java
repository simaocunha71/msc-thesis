The problem asks to change the numerical base of a given number `x` to a new base `base`. The new base should be less than 10. For example, if the input number is 8 and the base is 3, the output should be "22".

Here is the Java solution for the problem:

```java
public String changeBase(int x, int base) {
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    while (x > 0) {
        int rem = x % base;
        if (rem > 9) {
            sb.insert(0, (char) (rem + 55)); // convert 10-35 to a-f
        } else {
            sb.insert(0, rem);
        }
        x /= base;
    }
    return sb.toString();
}
```

This solution uses a StringBuilder to build the output string. It repeatedly divides the input number `x` by the new base `base` and prepends the remainder to the StringBuilder. If the remainder is greater than 9, it converts it to a letter (a-f) by adding 55 to it. Finally, it returns the StringBuilder as a string.

You can test this function with different inputs to get the desired output. For example, `changeBase(8, 3)` returns "22", `changeBase(8, 2)` returns "1000", and `changeBase(7, 2)` returns "111".
