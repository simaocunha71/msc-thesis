Explanation:
The problem is to check if two given strings have the same characters. This can be done by counting the frequency of each character in both strings and comparing the results.

In the given solution, we first check if the lengths of the two strings are equal. If they are not, we immediately return `false` because the strings cannot have the same characters if they have different lengths.

We then create two hash maps, `map0` and `map1`, to store the frequency of each character in `s0` and `s1` respectively. We iterate over each character in the strings and update the corresponding count in the hash maps.

Finally, we compare the two hash maps using the `equals` method. If they are equal, it means that the two strings have the same characters, and we return `true`. Otherwise, we return `false`.
