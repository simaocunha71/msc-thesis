In this solution, we use a for loop to iterate from 1 to x. In each iteration, we calculate the power of n raised to the current iteration value i. If this calculated value is equal to x, we return true, indicating that x is a simple power of n. If the loop finishes without finding such a value, we return false. This solution has a time complexity of O(log(x)) because the maximum number of iterations is the number of times n can be raised to the power of 2 (which is log2(x)).  For example, for the input x = 8 and n = 2, the loop will iterate 3 times: 2^1 = 2, 2^2 = 4, and 2^3 = 8. Therefore, the function will return true.  Similarly, for the input x = 3 and n = 2, the loop will iterate only once: 2^1 = 2, and then stop because 2^2 = 4 > 3. Therefore, the function will return false.  This solution is efficient and works for all positive integers x and n.  It is a simple and intuitive approach to solve the problem.  It can be easily implemented in any programming language.
