    Explanation:

    The problem is asking to check if a given number `x` is a simple power of another number `n`, i.e., `n` raised to the power of an integer.

    We can solve this problem by using the property of logarithms: `log(a^b) = b * log(a)`. This means that if `x` is a simple power of `n`, then `log(x)` divided by `log(n)` should be an integer.

    In the code, we use the `Math.log` function to calculate the logarithm of `x` with base `n`. We then divide this result by `log(n)` to get the exponent. If the exponent is an integer, then `x` is a simple power of `n`, and we return `true`. Otherwise, we return `false`.

    This solution has a time complexity of O(1) because it only involves a few mathematical operations, and a space complexity of O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the result.
