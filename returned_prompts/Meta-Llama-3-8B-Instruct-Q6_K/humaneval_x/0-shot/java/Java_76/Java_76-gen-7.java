Explanation:

The problem is asking to check if a given number `x` is a simple power of another number `n`. A simple power is when `n` is raised to an integer power and equals `x`.

The approach is to iterate through powers of `n` from 1 to `x` and check if `n` raised to that power equals `x`. If it does, return `true`. If no such power is found, return `false`.

The code uses a for loop to iterate through powers of `n`. Inside the loop, it checks if `n` raised to the current power equals `x` using the `Math.pow` function. If it does, the function returns `true`. If the loop completes without finding a match, the function returns `false`.

The `(int)` cast is used to convert the result of `Math.pow` to an integer, as `Math.pow` returns a double. This is necessary because the problem requires an exact match, not a close approximation.

This solution has a time complexity of O(log(x)), where `x` is the input number, because the maximum number of iterations is when `n` is raised to the power of `x`. The space complexity is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the loop variables.
