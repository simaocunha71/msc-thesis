The problem is asking to write a function that determines whether a given number `x` is a simple power of another number `n`. In other words, it checks if `n` raised to the power of an integer is equal to `x`.

Here's the solution:
```java
public boolean isSimplePower(int x, int n) {
    for (int i = 1; Math.pow(n, i) <= x; i++) {
        if (Math.pow(n, i) == x) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```
This function iterates through the powers of `n` starting from 1 and checks if any power is equal to `x`. If it finds a match, it returns `true`. If it doesn't find a match after checking all powers, it returns `false`.

For example, if we call `isSimplePower(8, 2)`, the function will iterate through the powers of 2: 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, ..., until it finds 2^3 = 8, which is equal to the input `x`. Therefore, it returns `true`. If we call `isSimplePower(3, 2)`, the function will iterate through the powers of 2: 2^1, 2^2, ..., until it finds that none of them are equal to 3, so it returns `false`.
