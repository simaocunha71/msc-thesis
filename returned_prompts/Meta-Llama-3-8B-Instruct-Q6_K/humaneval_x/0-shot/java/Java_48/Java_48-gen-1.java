```java
public boolean isPalindrome(String text) {
    text = text.toLowerCase();
    String reversed = new StringBuilder(text).reverse().toString();
    return text.equals(reversed);
}
```
The code will check if the given string is a palindrome. It does this by first converting the string to lowercase to ignore case sensitivity. Then it creates a new string that is the reverse of the original string. Finally, it checks if the original string is equal to the reversed string. If they are equal, the function returns true, indicating that the string is a palindrome. Otherwise, it returns false. This solution has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the length of the string, as it needs to iterate over the entire string to reverse it and compare it with the original string. The space complexity is also O(n) as it needs to store the reversed string. This solution can be improved by only comparing characters from the start and end of the string, without creating a new string. This would reduce the space complexity to O(1). Here is the improved solution:
```java
public boolean isPalindrome(String text) {
    text = text.toLowerCase();
    int start = 0;
    int end = text.length() - 1;
    while (start < end) {
        if (text.charAt(start) != text.charAt(end)) {
            return false;
        }
        start++;
        end--;
    }
    return true;
}
```
This solution has a time complexity of O(n/2) which is equivalent to O(n) and a space complexity of O(1). It only needs to keep track of the start and end indices of the string, and does not need to create a new string. This makes it more efficient than the previous solution.
