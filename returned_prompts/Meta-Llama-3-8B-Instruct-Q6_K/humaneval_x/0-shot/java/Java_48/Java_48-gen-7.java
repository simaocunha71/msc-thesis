        // Create a variable to store the result
        boolean result = true;

        // Convert the string to lowercase and remove non-alphanumeric characters
        text = text.toLowerCase().replaceAll("[^a-z0-9]", "");

        // Compare the string with its reverse
        String reverse = new StringBuilder(text).reverse().toString();

        // Check if the string is equal to its reverse
        if (!text.equals(reverse)) {

Explanation:
This code defines a method called `isPalindrome` that takes a string as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the string is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward.

The method first converts the input string to lowercase and removes any non-alphanumeric characters (such as spaces, punctuation, etc.) using the `replaceAll` method. This is done to ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive and ignores non-alphanumeric characters.

Next, the method creates a new string by reversing the input string using the `StringBuilder` class. This is done by creating a new `StringBuilder` object, calling its `reverse` method, and then converting the resulting `StringBuilder` object to a string using the `toString` method.

Finally, the method compares the original string with its reverse using the `equals` method. If the two strings are equal, the method returns `true`, indicating that the input string is a palindrome. If the two strings are not equal, the method returns `false`, indicating that the input string is not a palindrome.

The code is written in Java, but the logic is applicable to other programming languages as well. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because it needs to iterate over the entire string to reverse it and compare it with the original string. The space complexity is O(n) as well, because it needs to store the reversed string in memory.
