    if (isPrime(n)) {

public static boolean isPrime(int n) {

C:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        System.out.println(solution.xOrY(7, 34, 12));  // prints 34
        System.out.println(solution.xOrY(15, 8, 5));   // prints 5
    }
}
R:
The main function is used to test the xOrY function by creating an instance of the Solution class and calling the xOrY function with different inputs. The results are then printed out to the console. The output of this program will be:
34
5

This means that the xOrY function is correctly returning the value of x when the input number n is a prime number, and returning the value of y when n is not a prime number. The isPrime function is used to check if a number is prime, and it does this by checking if the number is divisible by any integer between 2 and the square root of the number. If the number is divisible by any of these integers, it is not prime. Otherwise, it is prime.  The xOrY function uses this isPrime function to determine whether the input number n is prime, and returns the value of x if it is, and the value of y if it is not. This is a simple but effective way to implement this functionality.  The output of this program shows that the xOrY function is working correctly, and that it is returning the correct values for the given inputs.  This demonstrates that the program is functioning as intended.
