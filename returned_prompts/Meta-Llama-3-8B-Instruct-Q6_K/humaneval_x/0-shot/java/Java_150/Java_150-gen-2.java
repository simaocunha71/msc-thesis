C:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        System.out.println(solution.xOrY(7, 34, 12)); //34
        System.out.println(solution.xOrY(15, 8, 5)); //5
    }
}
Explanation:
This Java program uses a class named Solution which has a method named xOrY(). This method takes three integer parameters n, x, and y. It checks if the number n is a prime number or not. If n is a prime number, it returns the value of x; otherwise, it returns the value of y. The isPrime() method checks if a given number is prime or not by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number and checking for divisibility. If the number is divisible, it is not a prime number. Otherwise, it is a prime number. The main method is used to test the xOrY() method with different inputs. The output will be the value of x if the input number is prime, and the value of y otherwise. For example, for the input (7, 34, 12), the output will be 34 because 7 is a prime number, and for the input (15, 8, 5), the output will be 5 because 15 is not a prime number.  }  }  }  }
