The problem is asking to write a function that calculates 2^n modulo p, where n and p are integers.

Here is the solution in Java:
```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int modp(int n, int p) {
        if (n == 0) {
            return 1;
        }
        if (n % 2 == 0) {
            int half = modp(n / 2, p);
            return (half * half) % p;
        } else {
            return (2 % p * modp(n - 1, p)) % p;
        }
    }
}
```
This function uses the property of modular exponentiation that states that (a * b) % p = ((a % p) * (b % p)) % p. It also uses the fact that if n is even, then 2^n can be calculated as (2^(n/2))^2, and if n is odd, then 2^n can be calculated as 2 * 2^(n-1).

The function first checks if n is 0, in which case it returns 1. Then it checks if n is even, in which case it calculates 2^n as (2^(n/2))^2. If n is odd, it calculates 2^n as 2 * 2^(n-1).

The function uses recursion to calculate 2^n, and it uses the modulo operator (%) to ensure that the result is within the range [0, p-1]. This is necessary because the result of the calculation could be larger than p, and taking the remainder modulo p ensures that the result is within the desired range.

The time complexity of this function is O(log n), because it uses recursion to calculate 2^n, and the number of recursive calls is proportional to the number of bits in the binary representation of n. The space complexity is O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the variables and the recursive call stack.
