Explanation:
This problem is asking to find if there are two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero. We can solve this problem by using a HashSet to store unique elements in the list. Then, we iterate over each element in the set, and for each element, we check if there is another element in the set that is its negative. If we find such a pair, we return true. If we don't find any such pair after checking all elements, we return false.

In the given code, we first convert the list to a set to remove duplicates. Then, we iterate over each element in the set. For each element, we use the contains method of the set to check if there is another element that is its negative. If we find such a pair, we return true. If we don't find any such pair after checking all elements, we return false.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. The space complexity is also O(n), as we are storing all elements in the set. This solution works well for large lists, as the contains method of the set has an average time complexity of O(1), making the overall time complexity linear.
