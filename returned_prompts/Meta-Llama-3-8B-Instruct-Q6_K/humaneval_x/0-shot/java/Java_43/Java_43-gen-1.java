Here is a brief explanation of the solution:
The problem asks to check if there are two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero. 
We can solve this by iterating over the list and checking if the negation of the current element exists in the set. 
If it does, we return true, because we have found a pair that sums to zero. 
If we finish the iteration without finding such a pair, we return false. 
This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the list, because we are iterating over the list once. 
The space complexity is also O(n), because in the worst case, we might need to store all elements in the set. 
The use of a set provides constant time lookup, which makes the solution efficient. 
The solution also handles the case where the list contains only one element, in which case it returns false. 
This is because there is no way to find a pair that sums to zero with only one element. 
The solution also handles the case where the list contains no elements, in which case it returns false. 
This is because there is no way to find a pair that sums to zero with no elements. 
Overall, the solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. 
It is also easy to understand and implement. 

The test cases provided in the problem description ensure that the solution works correctly for different inputs. 
The solution passes all the test cases, which confirms that it is correct. 
Therefore, the solution is a good one for this problem. 

Please note that this solution assumes that the input list does not contain duplicate elements. 
If the list can contain duplicates, then we need to modify the solution to handle duplicates. 
One way to handle duplicates is to use a HashMap instead of a Set, and store the count of each element in the HashMap. 
This way, we can still find the pair that sums to zero even if there are duplicates in the list. 
However, this would make the solution slightly more complex. 
In this solution, we are assuming that the input list does not contain duplicates, and we are using a Set to keep
