    The problem asks you to find the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array palindromic. 

    We can solve this problem by iterating over the array from both ends (beginning and end) and comparing the elements. 

    If the elements are not equal, we increment a counter for the number of changes needed. 

    We continue this process until we reach the middle of the array.

    Here is the Java code for the solution:

```java
public int smallestChange(List<Integer> arr) {
    int changes = 0;
    int left = 0;
    int right = arr.size() - 1;

    while (left < right) {
        if (arr.get(left) != arr.get(right)) {
            changes++;
        }
        left++;
        right--;
    }

    return changes;
}
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the array, and a space complexity of O(1), since we are not using any extra space that scales with the input size. 

The code works by initializing two pointers, one at the beginning of the array and one at the end. It then iterates over the array, comparing the elements at the two pointers. If the elements are not equal, it increments a counter for the number of changes needed. The pointers are then moved towards the center of the array. This process continues until the pointers meet or cross each other. At this point, the number of changes needed to make the array palindromic is the value of the counter. 

This solution assumes that the input array is non-empty. If the input array is empty, the function will return 0, which is correct since an empty array is already palindromic. 

The function is case-insensitive, meaning it treats integers as equal if they have the same value, regardless of their signs or magnitudes. 

The function returns the minimum number of changes needed to make the array palindromic. If the array is already palindromic, the function returns 0. 

This solution is efficient and easy to understand, making it a good choice for this problem. 

Note that this solution assumes that the array is a list of integers. If the array is a list of strings or any other type of object, the solution would need to be modified accordingly. 





Final Answer: The final answer is the Java code for the solution. I hope it is correct.
