The problem is asking to find the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array palindromic. A palindromic array is an array that is read the same backwards and forwards. In one change, you can change one element to any other element.

The approach to solve this problem is to iterate through the array and find the first pair of elements that are not equal. Then, find the first pair of elements that are equal from the end of the array to the beginning. If these two pairs are not the same, it means that the array is not palindromic and we need to change some elements. The number of changes needed is the sum of the distances from the first pair to the start of the array and from the second pair to the end of the array.

Here is the implementation in Java:

```java
public int smallestChange(List<Integer> arr) {
    int start = 0, end = arr.size() - 1;
    while (start < end) {
        if (!arr.get(start).equals(arr.get(end))) {
            int left = start, right = end;
            while (left < right) {
                if (arr.get(left).equals(arr.get(right))) {
                    left++;
                    right--;
                } else {
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (left < right) {
                start = left + 1;
            } else {
                end = right - 1;
            }
        } else {
            start++;
            end--;
        }
    }
    return start;
}
```

In this implementation, we use two pointers, `start` and `end`, to iterate through the array from the start and end respectively. We compare the elements at `start` and `end` indices. If they are not equal, we find the first pair of equal elements from the start and end of the array. If these two pairs are not the same, we increment `start` and decrement `end`. If they are the same, we increment `start` and decrement `end`. Finally, we return `start` as the minimum number of changes needed. If the array is already palindromic, `start` will be equal to 0, which means no changes are needed.
