Explanation:
The problem asks to find the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array palindromic. A palindromic array is an array that is read the same backwards and forwards. In one change, you can change one element to any other element.

To solve this problem, we can convert the array to a string and then compare the string with its reverse. If the string is not equal to its reverse, then we need to change some elements to make it palindromic. We can count the number of elements that need to be changed by counting the number of mismatched characters between the string and its reverse.

Here is the code in Java:

```java
public int smallestChange(List<Integer> arr) {
    int n = arr.size();
    int res = 0;
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sb.append(arr.get(i));
    }
    String s = sb.toString();
    int i = 0, j = s.length() - 1;
    while (i < j) {
        if (s.charAt(i) != s.charAt(j)) {
            res++;
            j--;
        } else {
            i++;
            j--;
        }
    }
    return res;
}
```

In this code, we first convert the array to a string using a StringBuilder. Then we initialize two pointers, i and j, to the start and end of the string respectively. We then enter a loop that continues until i is greater than or equal to j. Inside the loop, we compare the characters at positions i and j. If they are not equal, we increment the result and decrement j. If they are equal, we increment i and decrement j. Finally, we return the result, which is the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array
