The problem is asking to shift every character in a given string by 5 positions in the alphabet. 

The `encodeShift` function takes a string as input and returns the encoded string. It iterates over each character in the input string, adds 5 to its ASCII value, and appends the resulting character to a `StringBuilder`. If the result exceeds the ASCII value of 'z', it wraps around to 'a'.

The `decodeShift` function takes an encoded string as input and returns the decoded string. It does the opposite of `encodeShift`: it iterates over each character in the input string, subtracts 5 from its ASCII value, and appends the resulting character to a `StringBuilder`. If the result is less than the ASCII value of 'a', it wraps around to 'z'.

Here's the complete code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    public String encodeShift(String s) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            sb.append((char) ('a' + ((ch + 5 - 'a') % 26)));
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }

    public String decodeShift(String s) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            sb.append((char) ('a' + ((ch - 5 - 'a') % 26)));
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because it iterates over each character in the string once. The space complexity is O(n) as well, because it uses a `StringBuilder` to store the result.
