The problem is asking you to create a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string where every character is shifted by 5 positions in the alphabet. If the character is 'z', it should wrap around to 'a'.

Here's a Java solution using a StringBuilder and the modulus operator to handle the wrapping:

```java
class Solution {
    public String encodeShift(String s) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            sb.append((char) ('a' + ((ch + 5 - 'a') % 26)));
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```

This function works by iterating over each character in the input string. For each character, it calculates the new character by adding 5 to the ASCII value of the current character, subtracting the ASCII value of 'a', taking the modulus of the result by 26 (to wrap around to 'a' if necessary), and then converting the result back to a character. The new character is then appended to the StringBuilder. The result is a new string where every character is shifted by 5 positions in the alphabet.

To decode the string, you can simply reverse the process:

```java
class Solution {
    public String decodeShift(String s) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            sb.append((char) ('a' + ((ch - 'a') % 26)));
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```

This function works by iterating over each character in the input string, subtracting the ASCII value of 'a' from the ASCII value of the current character, taking the modulus of the result by 26 (to wrap around to 'z' if necessary), and then converting the result back to a character. The new character is then appended to the StringBuilder. The result is a new string where every character is shifted back by 5 positions in the alphabet.
