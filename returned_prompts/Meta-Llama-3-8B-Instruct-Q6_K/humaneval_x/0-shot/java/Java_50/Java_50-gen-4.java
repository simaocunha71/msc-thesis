The code provided is for encoding and decoding a string by shifting every character by 5 positions in the alphabet.

The encodeShift function takes a string as input and returns the encoded string. It does this by iterating over each character in the string, adding 5 to the ASCII value of the character, and then converting the resulting value back to a character. If the resulting character is beyond 'z', it wraps around to 'a'.

The decodeShift function takes an encoded string as input and returns the decoded string. It does the reverse of the encodeShift function, subtracting 5 from the ASCII value of each character and then converting the resulting value back to a character.

Here is the complete code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    /**
    returns encoded string by shifting every character by 5 in the alphabet.
     */
    public String encodeShift(String s) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            sb.append((char) ('a' + ((ch + 5 - 'a') % 26)));
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }

    /**
    takes as input string encoded with encodeShift function. Returns decoded string.
     */
    public String decodeShift(String s) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            sb.append((char) ('a' + ((ch - 5 - 'a') % 26)));
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```

You can test this code with a string like "hello" to encode it and then decode it back to the original string. For example:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Solution solution = new Solution();
    String s = "hello";
    String encoded = solution.encodeShift(s);
    System.out.println("Encoded: " + encoded);
    String decoded = solution.decodeShift(encoded);
    System.out.println("Decoded: " + decoded);
}
```

This will output:

```
Encoded: mjqqt
Decoded: hello
