The problem is asking you to create a function that takes a string as an input and returns the string where each character is shifted by 5 places in the alphabet. For example, if the input string is "abc", the output should be "fgh".

Here is a simple solution in Java:

```java
class Solution {
    public String encodeShift(String s) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            sb.append((char) ('a' + ((ch + 5 - 'a') % 26)));
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }

    public String decodeShift(String s) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            sb.append((char) ('a' + ((ch - 5 - 'a') % 26)));
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```

In the encodeShift function, we iterate over each character in the input string. We add 5 to the ASCII value of the character to shift it 5 places forward in the alphabet. We use the modulo operator to handle cases where the shift would go beyond 'z'. We then append the shifted character to a StringBuilder.

In the decodeShift function, we do the opposite. We subtract 5 from the ASCII value of the character to shift it 5 places backward in the alphabet. Again, we use the modulo operator to handle cases where the shift would go beyond 'a'. We then append the shifted character to a StringBuilder.

You can test these functions with different input strings to see that they work correctly. For example, encodeShift("abc") should return "fgh", and decodeShift("fgh") should return "abc".
