The code you provided appears to be a solution for a problem where you need to encode and decode a string by shifting each character by 5 positions in the alphabet. The encodeShift function takes a string as input, and for each character in the string, it adds 5 to the ASCII value of the character and takes the result modulo 26 (the number of letters in the alphabet). This effectively shifts each character 5 positions forward in the alphabet.

The decodeShift function does the opposite: it subtracts 5 from the ASCII value of each character and takes the result modulo 26.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public String encodeShift(String s) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            sb.append((char) ('a' + ((ch - 'a' + 5) % 26)));
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }

    public String decodeShift(String s) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            sb.append((char) ('a' + ((ch - 'a' - 5) % 26)));
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```

This code should work correctly for encoding and decoding strings. The encodeShift function shifts each character 5 positions forward in the alphabet, and the decodeShift function shifts each character 5 positions backward. The modulo operation ensures that the result stays within the range of the alphabet.
