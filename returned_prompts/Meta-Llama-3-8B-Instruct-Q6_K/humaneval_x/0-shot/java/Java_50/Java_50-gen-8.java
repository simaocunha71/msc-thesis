The given code is a solution to a problem where a string is encoded by shifting every character by 5 positions in the alphabet. The encoded string is then decoded by shifting each character back by 5 positions.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

1. `encodeShift(String s)` function: This function takes a string as input and returns the encoded string. It iterates through each character in the input string, adds 5 to the ASCII value of the character, and appends the resulting character to a `StringBuilder`. The `% 26` operation is used to ensure that the character remains within the range of 'a' to 'z'.

2. `decodeShift(String s)` function: This function takes an encoded string as input and returns the decoded string. It iterates through each character in the input string, subtracts 5 from the ASCII value of the character, and appends the resulting character to a `StringBuilder`. The `% 26` operation is used to ensure that the character remains within the range of 'a' to 'z'.

The code uses the modulo operator (`%`) to ensure that the character remains within the range of 'a' to 'z'. This is necessary because adding 5 to 'z' would result in a character outside the range of 'a' to 'z'. By using the modulo operator, the code ensures that the character wraps around to 'a' when it reaches the end of the alphabet.

The code also uses the `StringBuilder` class to efficiently build the encoded and decoded strings. This is because the `StringBuilder` class is designed for string manipulation and is more efficient than concatenating strings using the `+` operator.
