The provided Java code is for encoding and decoding strings by shifting each character by 5 positions in the alphabet.

The `encodeShift` method takes a string as input and returns the encoded string. It iterates over each character in the string, checks if it is a letter, and if so, shifts it by 5 positions in the alphabet. If the character is not a letter (e.g., a space or punctuation mark), it is left unchanged.

The `decodeShift` method takes an encoded string as input and returns the decoded string. It also iterates over each character in the string, checks if it is a letter, and if so, shifts it back by 5 positions in the alphabet. If the character is not a letter, it is left unchanged.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    public String encodeShift(String s) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (Character.isLetter(ch)) {
                char base = Character.isUpperCase(ch) ? 'A' : 'a';
                sb.append((char) ((ch - base + 5) % 26 + base));
            } else {
                sb.append(ch);
            }
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
