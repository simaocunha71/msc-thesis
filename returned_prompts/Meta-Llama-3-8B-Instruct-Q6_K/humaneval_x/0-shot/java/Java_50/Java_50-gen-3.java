The problem is asking to create a function that takes a string as input and returns the string after shifting every character by 5 positions in the alphabet. The function should work for both lowercase and uppercase letters.

Here's the correct solution:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    /**
    returns decoded string by shifting every character by -5 in the alphabet.
     */
    public String decodeShift(String s) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (Character.isUpperCase(ch)) {
                sb.append((char) ('A' + ((ch - 65 - 5) % 26)));
            } else {
                sb.append((char) ('a' + ((ch - 97 - 5) % 26)));
            }
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```

This function uses a StringBuilder to construct the decoded string. It iterates over each character in the input string, and for each character, it checks if it is uppercase or lowercase. If it is uppercase, it subtracts 65 (the ASCII value of 'A') from the character, subtracts 5, and takes the remainder when divided by 26. If it is lowercase, it subtracts 97 (the ASCII value of 'a') from the character, subtracts 5, and takes the remainder when divided by 26. The resulting character is then appended to the StringBuilder. Finally, the function returns the decoded string.
