The problem is asking whether it is possible to sort the given array in non-decreasing order by performing right shift operations. We can solve this problem by iterating through the array and checking if the current element is less than the next one. If it is, we can perform a right shift operation to move the current element to the next position.

Here is the solution in Java:

```java
public boolean moveOneBall(List<Integer> arr) {
    int i = 0;
    while (i < arr.size() - 1) {
        if (arr.get(i) > arr.get(i + 1)) {
            return false;
        }
        i++;
    }
    return true;
}
```

In this solution, we iterate through the array using a while loop. For each element, we check if it is greater than the next one. If it is, we return false, because it is not possible to sort the array by performing right shift operations. If we reach the end of the array without finding any such pair, we return true, because the array can be sorted by performing right shift operations. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the size of the array. The space complexity is O(1), because we only use a constant amount of space.
