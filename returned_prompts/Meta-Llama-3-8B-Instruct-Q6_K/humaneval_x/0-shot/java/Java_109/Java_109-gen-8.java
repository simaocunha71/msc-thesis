The problem is asking to check if it's possible to get the array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing right shift operations. 

Here's a solution in Java:

```java
public boolean moveOneBall(List<Integer> arr) {
    if (arr.isEmpty()) {
        return true;
    }

    int smallest = Collections.min(arr);
    int last = arr.get(arr.size() - 1);
    if (smallest == last) {
        return true;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
        arr.add(0, arr.remove(arr.size() - 1));
        if (arr.get(0) == smallest) {
            return true;
        }
    }

    return false;
}
```

In this solution, we first check if the array is empty. If it is, we return true because we can get the array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing no right shift operations.

Then, we find the smallest and the last element of the array. If the smallest element is the same as the last element, we return true because we can get the array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing one right shift operation.

Next, we perform a loop that simulates the right shift operations. In each iteration, we remove the last element of the array and add it to the beginning of the array. We also check if the first element of the array is the smallest element. If it is, we return true because we can get the array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the right shift operations.

If we finish the loop without finding the smallest element at the beginning of the array, we return false because it's not possible to get the array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing right shift operations. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the size of the array because we perform a loop that iterates n times. The space complexity is O(1) because we only use a constant amount of space to store the smallest element and the last element. 

Note that this solution assumes that the input array has unique elements. If the array can have duplicate elements, we need to modify the solution to handle this case. 

For example, if the array has duplicate smallest elements, we need to find the smallest element that is not the last element. 

We can do this by keeping track of the smallest element we've seen so far and updating it if we find a smaller element. If we find the smallest element at the
