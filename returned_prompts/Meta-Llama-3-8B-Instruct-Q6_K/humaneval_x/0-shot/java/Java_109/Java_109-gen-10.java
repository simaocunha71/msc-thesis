The problem statement is asking to check if it's possible to sort the given array in non-decreasing order by performing right shift operations. 

The approach to solve this problem is to iterate through the array and check if the current element is greater than the next one. If it is, then we can't achieve a non-decreasing order by shifting the elements to the right. 

Here is the Java code to solve this problem:

```java
public boolean moveOneBall(List<Integer> arr) {
    int n = arr.size();
    if (n == 0) {
        return true;
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        if (arr.get(i) > arr.get(i + 1)) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    
    return true;
}
```

In this code, we first check if the array is empty. If it is, we return true because an empty array is already sorted. Then we iterate through the array and check if the current element is greater than the next one. If it is, we return false because we can't achieve a non-decreasing order by shifting the elements to the right. If we finish the loop without finding any such pair, we return true because the array is already sorted. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the array, and a space complexity of O(1) because we only use a constant amount of space to store the array and a few variables.
