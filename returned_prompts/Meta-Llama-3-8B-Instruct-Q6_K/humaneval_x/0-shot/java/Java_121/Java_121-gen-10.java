                if (lst.get(i) % 2 != 0) {
                    sum += lst.get(i);

S:
The problem asks to find the sum of all the odd numbers that are at even positions in the given list. The position of an element in the list is considered even if it is an index of the list that is divisible by 2. For example, the first element has position 1, the second element has position 2, the third element has position 3, and so on. So, the first element is at an odd position and the second element is at an even position.

Here is the Java code to solve this problem:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int solution(List<Integer> lst) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < lst.size(); i++) {
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                if (lst.get(i) % 2 != 0) {
                    sum += lst.get(i);
                }
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

In this code, we use a for loop to iterate over the list. For each element, we check if its position is even (i.e., `i % 2 == 0`) and if the element itself is odd (i.e., `lst.get(i) % 2 != 0`). If both conditions are true, we add the element to the sum. Finally, we return the sum. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the size of the list, because we iterate over the list once. The space complexity is O(1), because we use a constant amount of space to store the sum.  C
C++:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    int solution(std::vector<int> lst) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < lst.size(); i++) {
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                if (lst[i] % 2 != 0) {
                    sum += lst[i];
                }
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
};
```
