        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < lst.size(); i++) {
            if (i % 2 == 0 && lst.get(i) % 2 != 0) {
                sum += lst.get(i);
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}  // Correct solution

Explanation:
The problem asks to find the sum of all odd numbers in even positions in a given list. 

Here is the explanation of the code:

- We initialize a variable `sum` to store the sum of the odd numbers in even positions. 

- We iterate through the list using a for loop. 

- Inside the loop, we check if the current position `i` is even (`i % 2 == 0`) and if the current element is odd (`lst.get(i) % 2 != 0`). 

- If both conditions are true, it means the current element is an odd number in an even position, so we add it to the `sum`.

- Finally, we return the `sum` as the result.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the list, because we are iterating through the list once. The space complexity is O(1), as we are using a constant amount of space to store the sum.  // Correct solution
