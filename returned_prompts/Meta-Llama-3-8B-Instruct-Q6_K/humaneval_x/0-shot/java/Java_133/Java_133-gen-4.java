    public int sumSquares(List<Double> lst) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (double num : lst) {
            int ceil = (int) Math.ceil(num);
            sum += Math.pow(ceil, 2);
        }
        return sum;
    }
}

R:
The given problem is asking to find the sum of squares of the numbers in a given list, but before finding the square, each number in the list should be rounded to the upper integer using the ceiling function. 

We can solve this problem by iterating over each number in the list, rounding it to the upper integer using the ceiling function, squaring the result, and adding it to the sum. 

Here is the Java code for the problem:

```java
public int sumSquares(List<Double> lst) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (double num : lst) {
        int ceil = (int) Math.ceil(num);
        sum += Math.pow(ceil, 2);
    }
    return sum;
}
```

This code uses a for-each loop to iterate over each number in the list. For each number, it uses the ceiling function to round it to the upper integer, squares the result, and adds it to the sum. Finally, it returns the sum. 

This code assumes that the input list contains only double values. If the list can contain other types of numbers, you may need to add additional error checking code. 

For example, if the list contains a string that cannot be converted to a double, the code will throw a runtime error. You can add a try-catch block to catch and handle such errors. 

Here is an example of how you can modify the code to add error checking:

```java
public int sumSquares(List<Double> lst) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (Object obj : lst) {
        if (obj instanceof Double) {
            double num = (double) obj;
            int ceil = (int) Math.ceil(num);
            sum += Math.pow(ceil, 2);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Error: The list contains a non-numeric value.");
        }
    }
    return sum;
}
```

In this modified code, we use the instanceof operator to check if each object in the list is an instance of the Double class. If it is, we cast it to a double and proceed as before. If it is not, we print an error message and skip that value.
