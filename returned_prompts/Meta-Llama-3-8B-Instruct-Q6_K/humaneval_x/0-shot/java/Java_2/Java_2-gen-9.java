    public double truncateNumber(double number) {
        int integerPart = (int) Math.floor(number);
        return number - integerPart;
    }
}
Explanation:

The problem is asking to decompose a positive floating point number into its integer part and decimal part. The integer part is the largest integer smaller than the given number, and the decimal part is the leftover part always smaller than 1.

To solve this problem, we can use the `Math.floor()` function to get the integer part of the number. This function returns the largest integer less than or equal to the given number. We then subtract the integer part from the original number to get the decimal part.

In the given code, we first calculate the integer part using `(int) Math.floor(number)`. We then subtract the integer part from the original number to get the decimal part. The result is returned as a double value.

For example, if the input number is 3.5, the integer part is 3 and the decimal part is 0.5. The function will return 0.5.
