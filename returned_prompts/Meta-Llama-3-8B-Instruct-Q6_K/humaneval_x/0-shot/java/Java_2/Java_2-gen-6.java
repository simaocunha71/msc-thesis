Here is a simple Java method that truncates a decimal number to its integer part and returns the remaining decimal part:

```java
public double truncateNumber(double number) {
    return number - (int) number;
}
```

This method works by subtracting the integer part of the number (obtained by casting the number to an integer) from the original number. The result is the decimal part of the number. For example, if the input number is 3.5, the method will return 0.5. 

This method is called a "truncate" operation, because it effectively "truncates" the integer part of the number and leaves only the decimal part. 

The output of this method will be a decimal number, because it is a part of a larger decimal number. The output will always be less than 1.0, because the integer part of the original number is greater than or equal to the integer part of the output. 

This method is used to decompose a decimal number into its integer and decimal parts. The integer part is the largest integer smaller than the given number, and the decimal part is the leftover part always smaller than 1.0. 

For example, if the input number is 3.5, the output will be 0.5, which is the decimal part of the number. The integer part is 3, and the decimal part is 0.5. 

This method can be used to solve various mathematical problems, such as calculating the decimal part of a number, or decomposing a number into its integer and decimal parts. 

Note that this method assumes that the input number is a positive floating point number. If the input number is negative, the output will also be negative. If the input number is not a floating point number, the output will be 0.0. 

This method is not suitable for use with very large or very small numbers, because the results may be inaccurate due to the limitations of floating point arithmetic. In such cases, it may be necessary to use a different method or data type, such as a string or a big decimal number.
