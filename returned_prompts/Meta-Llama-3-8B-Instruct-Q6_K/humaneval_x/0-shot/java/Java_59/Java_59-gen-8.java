Explanation:
This problem is asking for the largest prime factor of a given number. The function `largestPrimeFactor(int n)` takes an integer as input and returns the largest prime factor. The prime factors of a number are the numbers that divide it without leaving a remainder. For example, the prime factors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. The largest prime factor of 24 is 2.

The function first initializes a variable `max` to 1, which will store the largest prime factor. It then iterates from 2 to the square root of the input number `n`. For each number `i` in this range, it checks if `n` is divisible by `i` using the modulo operator (`n % i == 0`). If `n` is divisible by `i`, it means that `i` is a factor of `n`, so it updates `max` to `i` and divides `n` by `i` to remove the factor.

After the loop, if `n` is greater than 1, it means that `n` is a prime number itself, so it updates `max` to `n`. Finally, it returns `max` as the largest prime factor.

The time complexity of this function is O(sqrt(n)), where `n` is the input number. This is because it iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` and performs a constant number of operations for each iteration. The space complexity is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the variables.
