This improved solution only checks up to the square root of the given number, which significantly improves its efficiency. It also handles the case where the given number is a prime number by returning the number itself in the end. This is because the largest prime factor of a prime number is the number itself. The time complexity of this improved solution is O(sqrt(n)), which is much better than the original solution's time complexity of O(n).
