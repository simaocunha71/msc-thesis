Explanation:
This code defines a method `isBored` that takes a string of words as input and returns the number of boredoms in the string. A boredom is a sentence that starts with the word "I".

The method first splits the input string into sentences using a regular expression that matches the characters '.', '?', or '!'. This is done using the `split` method, which takes a regular expression as its first argument and returns an array of strings, where each string is a substring of the original string that matches the regular expression.

The method then initializes a boredom counter to 0. It then iterates over each sentence in the array of sentences using a for-each loop. For each sentence, it checks if the sentence starts with the word "I" using the `startsWith` method. If it does, it increments the boredom counter.

Finally, the method returns the boredom count. This is done by returning the value of the boredom counter.

For example, if the input string is "The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather", the method will return 1, because there is one sentence that starts with the word "I". If the input string is "Hello world", the method will return 0, because there are no sentences that start with the word "I".
