The problem is asking to check if the length of the intersection of two given intervals is a prime number. An interval is a pair of integers, and the given intervals are closed, meaning they include both start and end.

Here is the Java solution for the problem:

```java
public String intersection(List<Integer> interval1, List<Integer> interval2) {
    int start = Math.max(interval1.get(0), interval2.get(0));
    int end = Math.min(interval1.get(1), interval2.get(1));

    if (start > end) {
        return "NO";
    }

    int length = end - start + 1;
    if (isPrime(length)) {
        return "YES";
    }
    return "NO";
}

public boolean isPrime(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) {
        return false;
    }
    for (int i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(n); i++) {
        if (n % i == 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

In this solution, we first calculate the start and end of the intersection by finding the maximum of the starts and the minimum of the ends of the given intervals. If the start is greater than the end, it means the intervals do not intersect, so we return "NO".

Then, we calculate the length of the intersection by subtracting the start from the end and adding 1 (because the end is inclusive).

Finally, we check if the length is a prime number using the `isPrime` function. If it is, we return "YES", otherwise, we return "NO".

The `isPrime` function checks if a number is prime by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number and checking if the number is divisible by any of these values. If it is, it returns false, otherwise, it returns true.
