The given problem requires you to determine whether the length of the intersection of two intervals is a prime number. 

Here is a Java solution for this problem:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public String intersection(List<Integer> interval1, List<Integer> interval2) {
        int start = Math.max(interval1.get(0), interval2.get(0));
        int end = Math.min(interval1.get(1), interval2.get(1));
        if (start > end) {
            return "NO";
        }
        int length = end - start + 1;
        for (int i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(length); i++) {
            if (length % i == 0) {
                return "NO";
            }
        }
        return "YES";
    }
}
```

This solution first calculates the start and end points of the intersection. If the start point is greater than the end point, it means the intervals do not intersect, so it returns "NO". Then it calculates the length of the intersection. Finally, it checks whether the length is a prime number by iterating from 2 to the square root of the length and checking if the length is divisible by any of these numbers. If it is, it returns "NO", otherwise, it returns "YES". 

This solution assumes that the intervals are valid (i.e., the start point is less than or equal to the end point) and that the length of the intersection is not zero. If these assumptions are not valid, additional checks should be added to handle these cases. 

The time complexity of this solution is O(sqrt(n)), where n is the length of the intersection. The space complexity is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space. 

This solution can be further optimized by using a more efficient primality test, such as the Miller-Rabin primality test, which has a lower time complexity. However, this would make the solution more complex and less readable. 

In practice, the intervals are typically small, so the time complexity of this solution is not a concern. Therefore, this solution is sufficient for most practical purposes. 

It's also worth noting that this solution assumes that the intervals are non-empty. If the intervals can be empty, additional checks should be added to handle this case. 

Finally, this solution returns a string "YES" or "NO", but it could also return a boolean value true or false, depending on the requirements of the problem. 

In summary,
