The problem requires us to check if the intersection of two intervals is a prime number. We first need to find the intersection of the two intervals. If the intersection is empty, we return "NO". Otherwise, we find the length of the intersection and check if it is a prime number. If it is, we return "YES", otherwise we return "NO".

Here is the solution in Java:
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public String intersection(List<Integer> interval1, List<Integer> interval2) {
        int start1 = Math.max(interval1.get(0), interval2.get(0));
        int end1 = Math.min(interval1.get(1), interval2.get(1));
        if (start1 > end1) {
            return "NO";
        }
        int intersectionLength = end1 - start1 + 1;
        if (isPrime(intersectionLength)) {
            return "YES";
        } else {
            return "NO";
        }
    }

    public boolean isPrime(int n) {
        if (n <= 1) {
            return false;
        }
        for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {
            if (n % i == 0) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
In the `intersection` method, we first find the start and end of the intersection by taking the maximum of the start of the two intervals and the minimum of the end of the two intervals. If the start is greater than the end, it means the intervals do not intersect, so we return "NO". Otherwise, we find the length of the intersection and check if it is a prime number using the `isPrime` method. If it is, we return "YES", otherwise we return "NO".

The `isPrime` method checks if a given number is prime by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number and checking if the number is divisible by any of the iterated numbers. If it is, it is not a prime number, so we return false. If it is not divisible by any of the iterated numbers, it is a prime number, so we return true.
