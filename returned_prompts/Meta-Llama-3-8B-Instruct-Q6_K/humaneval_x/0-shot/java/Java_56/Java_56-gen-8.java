Explanation:
The problem is asking to check if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the given string of brackets.

We can use a stack to solve this problem. We iterate through the string and for each opening bracket ('<'), we push it onto the stack. For each closing bracket ('>'), we check if the stack is empty or the top of the stack is not an opening bracket. If either of these conditions is true, we return false because there is no corresponding opening bracket.

After iterating through the entire string, we check if the stack is empty. If it is, it means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and we return true. If the stack is not empty, it means there are some opening brackets without corresponding closing brackets, and we return false.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string, and a space complexity of O(n) due to the use of the stack.
