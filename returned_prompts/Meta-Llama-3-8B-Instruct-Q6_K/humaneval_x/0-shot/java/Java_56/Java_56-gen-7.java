```java
public boolean correctBracketing(String brackets) {
    Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();
    for (char bracket : brackets.toCharArray()) {
        if (bracket == '<') {
            stack.push('<');
        } else if (bracket == '>') {
            if (stack.isEmpty() || stack.pop() != '<') {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    return stack.isEmpty();
}
```

Explanation:
This solution uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. For each character in the input string, if it's an opening bracket ('<'), we push it onto the stack. If it's a closing bracket ('>'), we check if the stack is empty (which means there's no corresponding opening bracket) or if the top of the stack doesn't match the closing bracket (which means the brackets are not balanced). If either of these conditions is true, we return false. After going through all the characters in the input string, we check if the stack is empty. If it is, that means all the opening brackets had corresponding closing brackets, so we return true. If the stack is not empty, that means there were some opening brackets that didn't have corresponding closing brackets, so we return false.
