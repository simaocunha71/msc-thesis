Here is a simple Java solution for the problem. This solution uses a Stack to keep track of the opening brackets. For each character in the string, if it's an opening bracket, it's pushed onto the stack. If it's a closing bracket, the stack is checked to see if it's empty or if the top of the stack doesn't match the current closing bracket. If either of these conditions is true, the function returns false.

```java
public boolean correctBracketing(String brackets) {
    Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();
    for (char c : brackets.toCharArray()) {
        if (c == '<') {
            stack.push('<');
        } else if (c == '>') {
            if (stack.isEmpty() || stack.pop() != '<') {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    return stack.isEmpty();
}
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string, because it processes each character in the string once. The space complexity is O(n) as well, because in the worst case, all characters in the string are opening brackets, so the stack will store all of them.
