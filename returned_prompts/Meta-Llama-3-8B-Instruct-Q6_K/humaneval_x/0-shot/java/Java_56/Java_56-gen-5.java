```java
import java.util.Stack;

public class Solution {
    public boolean correctBracketing(String brackets) {
        Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<Character>();
        for (char c : brackets.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == '<') {
                stack.push('<');
            } else if (c == '>') {
                if (stack.isEmpty() || stack.pop() != '<') {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return stack.isEmpty();
    }
}
```
This code defines a function `correctBracketing` that takes a string of brackets as input and returns `true` if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and `false` otherwise.

The function uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. It iterates over the input string, and for each character:
- If the character is an opening bracket ('<'), it pushes it onto the stack.
- If the character is a closing bracket ('>'), it checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack is not an opening bracket ('<'). If either condition is true, it returns `false`, because there is no corresponding opening bracket.
- If the stack is not empty after iterating over the entire string, it returns `false`, because there are still opening brackets without corresponding closing brackets.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because it iterates over the string once. The space complexity is O(n), because in the worst case, the stack will contain n opening brackets.
