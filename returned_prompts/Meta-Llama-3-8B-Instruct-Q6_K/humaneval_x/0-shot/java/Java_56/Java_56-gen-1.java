The above solution first creates a stack and then iterates over each character in the input string. If it encounters a '<' character, it pushes it onto the stack. If it encounters a '>' character, it checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack does not match the '>'. If either condition is true, it returns false. After iterating over all characters, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, it returns true, meaning that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. If the stack is not empty, it returns false, meaning that there are unmatched opening brackets. This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string, and a space complexity of O(n), where n is the number of opening brackets in the input string. .


The provided unit tests show that the function should return true for strings like "<>" or "<<><>>" and false for strings like "<" or "><<>". This is because the first two strings have every opening bracket matched with a corresponding closing bracket, while the last two strings do not.
