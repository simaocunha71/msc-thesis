This solution uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. When a closing bracket is encountered, it checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack is not an opening bracket. If either condition is true, it returns false. At the end, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, it means that every opening bracket had a corresponding closing bracket, so it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false. This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string, and a space complexity of O(n) since the stack can hold up to n elements.
