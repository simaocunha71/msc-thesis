```java
public boolean correctBracketing(String brackets) {
    Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();
    for (char c : brackets.toCharArray()) {
        if (c == '<') {
            stack.push(c);
        } else if (c == '>') {
            if (stack.isEmpty() || stack.pop() != '<') {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    return stack.isEmpty();
}
```

Explanation:
The problem is to check if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. We can use a stack to solve this problem. 

We iterate over the string, and for each character, if it's an opening bracket '<', we push it onto the stack. If it's a closing bracket '>', we check if the stack is empty or the top of the stack is not an opening bracket '<'. If either of these conditions is true, we return false, because there's no corresponding opening bracket for this closing bracket. 

After iterating over the entire string, we check if the stack is empty. If it's not empty, it means there are some opening brackets that don't have corresponding closing brackets, so we return false. If the stack is empty, it means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so we return true. 

The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string, because we iterate over the string once. The space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of opening brackets in the string, because in the worst case, we have to store all opening brackets in the stack.
