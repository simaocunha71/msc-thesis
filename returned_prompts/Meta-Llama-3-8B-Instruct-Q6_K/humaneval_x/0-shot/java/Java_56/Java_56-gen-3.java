```java
public boolean correctBracketing(String brackets) {
    Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();
    for (char c : brackets.toCharArray()) {
        if (c == '<') {
            stack.push(c);
        } else if (c == '>') {
            if (stack.isEmpty()) {
                return false;
            }
            stack.pop();
        }
    }
    return stack.isEmpty();
}
```
Explanation:
The problem is asking to check if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. We can use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. When we encounter a closing bracket, we check if the stack is empty (which means there's no corresponding opening bracket) or if the top of the stack is an opening bracket (which means we can pop it). If the stack is not empty after going through all the brackets, it means there are unmatched opening brackets, so we return false. Otherwise, we return true. 

The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string, because we're iterating through the string once. The space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of opening brackets in the string, because we're using a stack to store the opening brackets. 

The unit tests provided show that the function should return false for "<", true for "<>", true for "<<><>>", and false for "><<>". The function correctly passes these tests.
