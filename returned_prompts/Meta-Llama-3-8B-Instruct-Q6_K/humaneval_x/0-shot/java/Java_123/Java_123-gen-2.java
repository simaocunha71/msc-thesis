// Test
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Solution solution = new Solution();
    List<Integer> result = solution.getOddCollatz(5);
    System.out.println(result); // [1, 5]
}
```

The given task is to create a method that generates the Collatz sequence for a given number, and then filters out the odd numbers from the sequence. The sequence is generated by applying the Collatz function to the input number until it reaches 1. The Collatz function is defined as:

- If the previous term is even, the next term is half of the previous term.
- If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1.

The filtered sequence of odd numbers is then sorted in ascending order and returned.

In the provided Java code, the method `getOddCollatz(int n)` is implemented to achieve this. It first initializes an empty list `result` to store the odd numbers and an empty list `sequence` to store the entire Collatz sequence.

The method then enters a loop that continues until the input number `n` reaches 1. In each iteration, it applies the Collatz function to `n` and adds the result to the `sequence` list.

After the loop, the method iterates over the `sequence` list and adds any odd numbers to the `result` list. Finally, it sorts the `result` list in ascending order and returns it.

In the provided test code, the method is called with the input `5`, and the resulting list of odd numbers is printed to the console, which is `[1, 5]`.
