The problem is asking you to take a string of parentheses and separate them into individual groups of balanced parentheses. The groups are not nested within each other.

Here is a Java solution for the problem:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public List<String> separateParenGroups(String paren_string) {
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (char c : paren_string.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == '(') {
                sb.append(c);
            } else if (c == ')') {
                int count = sb.length() - 1;
                while (count > 0 && sb.charAt(count) == '(') {
                    sb.setCharAt(count, ')');
                    count--;
                }
                result.add(sb.toString());
                sb.setLength(0);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

In this solution, we iterate over the string and whenever we encounter a '(', we add it to the current group. When we encounter a ')', we check if the current group is balanced by counting the number of '(' and ')'. If the group is balanced, we add it to the result list and reset the current group. If the group is not balanced, we continue to add ')' to the group until it becomes balanced.

This solution works by iterating over the string once and using a StringBuilder to keep track of the current group. It uses a while loop to check if the group is balanced and add ')' to the group until it becomes balanced. This ensures that the groups are added to the result list in the correct order. The time complexity of this solution is O(n) where n is the length of the string, as we are iterating over the string once. The space complexity is also O(n) as in the worst case, the result list can contain n/2 groups.
