Here is a JavaScript solution for the problem:

```javascript
const roundedAvg = (n, m) => {
  if (n > m) return -1;
  const sum = (m + n) * (m - n + 1) / 2;
  const avg = Math.round(sum / (m - n + 1));
  return avg.toString(2);
};
```

Explanation:

1. First, we check if `n` is greater than `m`. If it is, we return -1.
2. Then, we calculate the sum of the integers from `n` through `m` using the formula `(m + n) * (m - n + 1) / 2`. This formula is based on the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.
3. We calculate the average by dividing the sum by the number of integers in the series, `m - n + 1`.
4. We round the average to the nearest integer using `Math.round`.
5. Finally, we convert the average to binary using the `toString(2)` method. This method converts a number to a string in base 2 (binary). We use this method to convert the rounded average to binary.

You can test the function with the examples you provided:

```javascript
console.log(roundedAvg(1, 5)); // Output: "0b11"
console.log(roundedAvg(7, 5)); // Output: -1
console.log(roundedAvg(10, 20)); // Output: "0b1111"
console.log(roundedAvg(20, 33)); // Output: "0b11010"
```
