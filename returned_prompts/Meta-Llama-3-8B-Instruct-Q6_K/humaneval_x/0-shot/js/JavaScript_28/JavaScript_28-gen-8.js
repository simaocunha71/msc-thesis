```
const concatenate = (strings) => strings.join('');
```


Explanation:
The `join` method is used to concatenate all the elements of an array into a single string. It takes an optional separator parameter, which defaults to a comma (",") if not provided. In this case, we're using an empty separator (`""`), which means the elements are joined without any separator. The `strings` array is passed as an argument to the `concatenate` function, and the `join` method is called on it to concatenate the strings. The resulting string is then returned by the function.
