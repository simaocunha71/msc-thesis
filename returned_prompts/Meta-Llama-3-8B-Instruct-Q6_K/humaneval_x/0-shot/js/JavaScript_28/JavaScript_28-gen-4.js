```javascript
const concatenate = (strings) => strings.join('');
```
Explanation:
The `join()` method is used to concatenate all the elements of an array into a single string. It takes an optional separator as an argument, which defaults to a comma (`,`) if not provided. In this case, we don't provide a separator, so it will concatenate the strings without any separator. The resulting string is then returned as the output of the `concatenate` function.
