```
const concatenate = (strings) => strings.join('');
```


Explanation:
The `join` method in JavaScript is used to concatenate all the elements of an array into a single string. It takes an optional separator as an argument, which is used to separate the elements in the resulting string. If no separator is provided, it defaults to a comma. In this case, we're using an empty separator `''` to concatenate the strings without any separation. The `strings` array is passed to the `join` method, and the resulting string is returned by the `concatenate` function.
