```
const concatenate = (strings) => strings.join('');
```


Explanation:

The `join()` method is used to concatenate all the elements of an array into a single string. It takes an optional separator as an argument, which is used to separate the elements in the resulting string. If no separator is provided, it defaults to a comma.

In this case, we are passing the `strings` array to the `join()` method without any separator, so the elements are concatenated without any spaces or punctuation.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array, because the `join()` method needs to iterate over all the elements in the array to concatenate them.

The space complexity is also O(n), because the resulting string can have a length of up to n times the length of the input array.
