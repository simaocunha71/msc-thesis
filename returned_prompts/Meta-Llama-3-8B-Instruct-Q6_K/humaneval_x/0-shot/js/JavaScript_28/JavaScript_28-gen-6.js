The task is to write a function that concatenates a list of strings into a single string.

Here's a simple solution in JavaScript:
```
const concatenate = (strings) => strings.join('');
```
This function uses the `join` method of the array, which concatenates all the elements of the array into a single string. The empty string `''` is used as the separator, which means that the elements will be concatenated without any separators in between.

Here are some examples:
```
console.log(concatenate([])); // ''
console.log(concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c'])); // 'abc'
```
This solution is concise and efficient, and it works for any number of input strings.
