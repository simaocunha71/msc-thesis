Explanation:
The problem is asking to find the minimum sum of any non-empty subarray of the given array.
We can solve this problem by iterating through the array and keeping track of the sum of the current subarray.
If the sum of the current subarray becomes positive, we reset it to 0.
We update the minimum sum whenever we find a smaller sum.
Finally, we return the minimum sum.

In the code, we initialize `minSum` to Infinity and `currentSum` to 0. Then, we iterate through the array and update `currentSum` and `minSum` accordingly. If `currentSum` becomes positive, we reset it to 0. Finally, we return the minimum sum.

Note that we also need to consider the case where the array is empty, so we use `Math.min(minSum, currentSum)` to handle this case.

For example, if the input array is [2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4], the minimum sum of any non-empty subarray is 1 (which is the sum of the subarray [1]). If the input array is [-1, -2, -3], the minimum sum of any non-empty subarray is -6 (which is the sum of the entire array).
