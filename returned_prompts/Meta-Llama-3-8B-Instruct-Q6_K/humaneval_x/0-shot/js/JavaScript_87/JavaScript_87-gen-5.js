Here is a Python solution for the problem:

```Python
def getRow(lst, x):
    result = []
    for i, row in enumerate(lst):
        if x in row:
            result.append((i, row.index(x)))
    result.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    return result
```

This function iterates over each row in the list. If the element `x` is found in the row, it appends a tuple `(i, row.index(x))` to the result list, where `i` is the row index and `row.index(x)` is the column index of `x` in the row. The result list is then sorted based on the row index in ascending order and the column index in descending order. The sorted result list is then returned.

Here is how you can test the function:

```Python
print(getRow([[1,2,3,4,5,6], [1,2,3,4,1,6], [1,2,3,4,5,1]], 1))  # Output: [(0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0)]
print(getRow([], 1))  # Output: []
print(getRow([[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3))  # Output: [(2, 2)]
```
