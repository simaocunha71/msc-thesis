```
const maximum = (arr, k) => {
  return arr.sort((a, b) => b - a).slice(0, k);
};
```

Explanation:
The problem is asking to return a sorted list of length k with the maximum k numbers in the given array. 

We can achieve this by sorting the array in descending order and then slicing the first k elements.

Here's how it works:
- `arr.sort((a, b) => b - a)`: This sorts the array in descending order. The lambda function `(a, b) => b - a` compares two elements a and b and returns a negative value if a is smaller than b, a positive value if a is larger than b, and 0 if they are equal.
- `slice(0, k)`: This slices the sorted array and returns a new array containing the first k elements.

For example, if the input array is `[-3, -4, 5]` and `k` is `3`, the function will return `[-4, -3, 5]`, which is the sorted list of length 3 with the maximum 3 numbers in the array. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the length of the array. The space complexity is O(k) for the result array. 

This solution is efficient and easy to implement, but it may not be suitable for large arrays or for applications where memory is a concern. In such cases, a more efficient solution might be needed. 





This is the solution to the problem. It uses the built-in `sort` method to sort the array in descending order and then uses the `slice` method to extract the first `k` elements. The result is a new array containing the `k` largest elements from the original array.
