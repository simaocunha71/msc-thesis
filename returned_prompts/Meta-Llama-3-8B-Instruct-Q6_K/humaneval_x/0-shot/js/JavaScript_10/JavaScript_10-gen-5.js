```javascript
const isPalindrome = (string) => {
  return string == string.split('').reverse().join('');
}

const makePalindrome = (string) => {
  if (isPalindrome(string)) return string;
  for (let i = string.length; i > 0; i--) {
    let suffix = string.slice(0, i);
    if (isPalindrome(suffix)) {
      let prefix = string.slice(i);
      let reversePrefix = prefix.split('').reverse().join('');
      return string + reversePrefix;
    }
  }
};
```


Explanation:
The `isPalindrome` function checks if a given string is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse. The `makePalindrome` function generates the shortest palindrome that begins with a given string. It does this by finding the longest postfix of the given string that is a palindrome, and appending to the end of the string the reverse of the string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of how `makePalindrome` works:
1. If the given string is already a palindrome, it returns the string as is.
2. It then iterates over the string from the end to the start, finding the longest postfix that is a palindrome.
3. Once it finds the palindromic suffix, it takes the remaining prefix of the string and reverses it.
4. It then appends the reversed prefix to the end of the string, effectively creating the shortest palindrome that begins with the given string.

For example, if the input string is "cata", the function will find the longest palindromic suffix as "a" and then append the reversed prefix "tac" to the end, resulting in the shortest palindrome "catac". If the input string is "cat", the function will find the longest palindromic suffix as "c" and then append the reversed prefix "tac" to the end, resulting in the shortest palindrome "catac". If the input string is an empty string, it simply returns an empty string.
