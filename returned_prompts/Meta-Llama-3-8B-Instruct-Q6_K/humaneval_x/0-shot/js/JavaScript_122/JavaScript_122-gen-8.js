Here is a simple solution in JavaScript:
```
const addElements = (arr, k) => {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    if (String(arr[i]).length <= 2) {
      sum += arr[i];
    }
  }
  return sum;
};
```
Here's an explanation of the code:

1. We initialize a variable `sum` to store the sum of the elements with at most two digits.
2. We loop through the first `k` elements of the array using a `for` loop.
3. For each element, we convert it to a string using `String(arr[i])`.
4. We check if the length of the string is less than or equal to 2 using `length <= 2`. This is because the length of a string represents the number of digits in the integer.
5. If the element has at most two digits, we add it to the `sum`.
6. Finally, we return the `sum`.

You can test this function with the example input you provided:
```
console.log(addElements([111, 21, 3, 4000, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], 4)); // Output: 24
```
This should return the correct sum of 21 + 3, which is 24.
