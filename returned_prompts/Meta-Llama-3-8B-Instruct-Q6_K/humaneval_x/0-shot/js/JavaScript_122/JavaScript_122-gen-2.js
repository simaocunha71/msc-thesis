```
const addElements = (arr, k) => {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    if (String(arr[i]).length <= 2) {
      sum += arr[i];
    }
  }
  return sum;
};
```
In this solution, we iterate over the first k elements of the array using a for loop. For each element, we convert it to a string and check if its length is less than or equal to 2. If it is, we add it to the sum. Finally, we return the sum. This solution has a time complexity of O(k) and a space complexity of O(1). It also satisfies the constraints given in the problem statement.
