Here is the solution to the problem:
```
const addElements = (arr, k) => {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    if (String(arr[i]).length <= 2) {
      sum += arr[i];
    }
  }
  return sum;
};
```
Here's an explanation of the solution:

1. We initialize a variable `sum` to 0, which will store the sum of the elements with at most two digits.
2. We iterate over the first `k` elements of the array using a for loop.
3. For each element, we convert it to a string using `String(arr[i])`. This allows us to check the length of the string representation of the element.
4. If the length of the string representation of the element is less than or equal to 2, it means that the element has at most two digits. In this case, we add the element to the `sum` variable.
5. Finally, we return the `sum` variable, which now contains the sum of the elements with at most two digits from the first `k` elements of the array.

You can test the function with the example input `arr = [111,21,3,4000,5,6,7,8,9], k = 4` to see that it returns the correct output `24`.
