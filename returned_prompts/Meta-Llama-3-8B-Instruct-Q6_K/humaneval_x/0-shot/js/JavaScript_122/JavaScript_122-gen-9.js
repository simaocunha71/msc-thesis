Here is the solution in JavaScript:
```javascript
const addElements = (arr, k) => {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    if (String(arr[i]).length <= 2) {
      sum += arr[i];
    } else {
      break;
    }
  }
  return sum;
};
```
Explanation:

1. We initialize a variable `sum` to 0, which will store the sum of the elements with at most two digits.
2. We loop through the first `k` elements of the array using a for loop.
3. For each element, we convert it to a string and check its length. If the length is less than or equal to 2, it means the element has at most two digits, so we add it to the `sum`.
4. If the length is greater than 2, it means the element has more than two digits, so we break out of the loop.
5. Finally, we return the `sum` variable, which contains the sum of the elements with at most two digits from the first `k` elements of the array.

You can test this function with the example input you provided:
```javascript
console.log(addElements([111, 21, 3, 4000, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], 4)); // Output: 24
```

    sum = 0
    for i in range(k):
        if len(str(arr[i])) <= 2:

        else:
            break
