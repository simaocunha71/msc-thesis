Here is the solution using JavaScript:
```javascript
const addElements = (arr, k) => {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    if (String(arr[i]).length <= 2) {
      sum += arr[i];
    }
  }
  return sum;
};
```
Explanation:

1. We initialize a variable `sum` to store the sum of the elements with at most two digits.
2. We loop through the first `k` elements of the array using a `for` loop.
3. For each element, we convert it to a string using `String(arr[i])` and check its length using `length`. If the length is less than or equal to 2, it means the element has at most two digits.
4. If the element has at most two digits, we add it to the `sum` variable using `sum += arr[i]`.
5. After the loop, we return the `sum` variable, which contains the sum of the elements with at most two digits from the first `k` elements of the array.

Example usage:
```javascript
const arr = [111, 21, 3, 4000, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];
const k = 4;
console.log(addElements(arr, k)); // Output: 24
