Here is the solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
const bf = (planet1, planet2) => {
  const planets = ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune'];
  const index1 = planets.indexOf(planet1);
  const index2 = planets.indexOf(planet2);
  
  if (index1 === -1 || index2 === -1) {
    return [];
  }
  
  const start = Math.min(index1, index2);
  const end = Math.max(index1, index2);
  
  return planets.slice(start + 1, end).sort((a, b) => planets.indexOf(a) - planets.indexOf(b));
};
```

This function first checks if both planet1 and planet2 are valid planet names by trying to find their indices in the planets array. If either of them is not found, the function returns an empty array.

Then, it determines the start and end indices of the range of planets to be returned. The start index is the minimum of the two indices, and the end index is the maximum. This ensures that the range includes all planets between planet1 and planet2, including planet1 and planet2 themselves if they are adjacent.

Finally, the function uses the slice method to extract the planets in the specified range, and the sort method to sort them in order of proximity to the sun. The sort method is implemented by comparing the indices of the planets in the planets array. The result is a tuple of planet names, sorted by their proximity to the sun.
