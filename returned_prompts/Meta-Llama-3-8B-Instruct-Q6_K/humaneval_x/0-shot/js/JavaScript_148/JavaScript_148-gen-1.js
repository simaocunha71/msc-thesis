```javascript
const planets = ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune'];
const planetIndex = planets.indexOf(planet1);
if (planetIndex === -1) return ();

const start = planetIndex;
const end = planets.indexOf(planet2);
if (end === -1) return ();

let result = [];
for (let i = start + 1; i < end; i++) {
  result.push(planets[i]);
}

return result;
```

Explanation:
The function `bf` takes two planet names as strings `planet1` and `planet2`. It first finds the index of `planet1` in the array of planets. If `planet1` is not found, it returns an empty tuple.

Then, it finds the index of `planet2` in the array of planets. If `planet2` is not found, it returns an empty tuple.

Next, it initializes an empty array `result` to store the planets whose orbits are located between the orbit of `planet1` and the orbit of `planet2`.

It then loops through the array of planets from the index after `planet1` to the index before `planet2`, and pushes each planet into the `result` array.

Finally, it returns the `result` array, which contains all planets whose orbits are located between the orbit of `planet1` and the orbit of `planet2`, sorted by the proximity to the sun.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of planets, because it needs to find the indices of `planet1` and `planet2` in the array of planets, and then loop through the array to find the planets between them. The space complexity is O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the indices and the result array.
