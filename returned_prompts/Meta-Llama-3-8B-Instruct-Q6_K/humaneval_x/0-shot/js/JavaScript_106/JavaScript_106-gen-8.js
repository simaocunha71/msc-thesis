Here is the solution in JavaScript:
```
const f = (n) => {
  const result = [];
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    if (i % 2 === 0) { // i is even
      result.push(factorial(i));
    } else { // i is odd
      let sum = 0;
      for (let j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
        sum += j;
      }
      result.push(sum);
    }
  }
  return result;
};

const factorial = (n) => {
  let result = 1;
  for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    result *= i;
  }
  return result;
};
```
This solution uses a for loop to iterate over the range from 1 to n. For each iteration, it checks if the current number `i` is even or odd. If `i` is even, it calculates the factorial of `i` using another function `factorial` and adds it to the result array. If `i` is odd, it calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to `i` and adds it to the result array.

The `factorial` function calculates the factorial of a given number `n` by iterating from 2 to `n` and multiplying the result by each number.

You can test the function with the example you provided:
```
console.log(f(5)); // [1, 2, 6, 24, 15]
```
This should output the expected result. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification! ðŸ˜Š

```python
def f(n):
    result = []
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            result.append(factorial(i))
        else:
            sum = 0
            for j in range(1, i+1):
                sum += j
            result.append(sum)
    return result

def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n+1):
        result *= i
    return result

print(f(5))  # [1, 2, 6, 24, 15]
```
This solution is similar to the JavaScript solution, but it uses Python instead. The `f` function iterates over the range from 1 to `n`, and for
