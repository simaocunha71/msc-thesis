```
const add = (x, y) => x + y;
```


Explanation:
The problem is asking to create a function that adds two numbers. The function should take two arguments, `x` and `y`, and return their sum.

In the solution, we define a function called `add` that takes two arguments `x` and `y`. Inside the function, we simply return the result of adding `x` and `y` using the `+` operator.

The function can be called with different arguments, such as `add(2, 3)` or `add(5, 7)`, and it will return the correct sum. For example, `add(2, 3)` will return `5` and `add(5, 7)` will return `12`.
