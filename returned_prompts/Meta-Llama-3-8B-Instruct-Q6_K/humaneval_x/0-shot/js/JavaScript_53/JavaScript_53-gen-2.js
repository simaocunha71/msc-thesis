```javascript
const add = (x, y) => x + y;
```
This code defines a function called `add` that takes two arguments, `x` and `y`, and returns their sum. The `=>` symbol is used to define the function, and the `x + y` expression is evaluated and returned as the result of the function. The function can be called with two numbers, like `add(2, 3)` or `add(5, 7)`, and it will return their sum. For example, `add(2, 3)` would return `5`, and `add(5, 7)` would return `12`.
