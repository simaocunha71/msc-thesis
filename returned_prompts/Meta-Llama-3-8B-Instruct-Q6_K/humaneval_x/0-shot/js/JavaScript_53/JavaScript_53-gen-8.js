```javascript
const add = (x, y) => x + y;
```
Explanation:

In this problem, we need to create a function called `add` that takes two numbers `x` and `y` as arguments and returns their sum.

The function can be defined using the arrow function syntax `(x, y) => x + y`. The `x` and `y` are the input parameters, and `x + y` is the calculation to be performed.

When we call the `add` function with the arguments `2` and `3`, it returns `5`, which is the sum of `2` and `3`. Similarly, when we call the `add` function with the arguments `5` and `7`, it returns `12`, which is the sum of `5` and `7`.
