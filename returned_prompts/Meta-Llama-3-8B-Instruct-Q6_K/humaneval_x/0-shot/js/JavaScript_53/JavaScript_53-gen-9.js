```javascript
const add = (x, y) => x + y;
```



Explanation:
The problem is asking you to create a function called `add` that takes two numbers `x` and `y` as arguments and returns their sum. The function should be able to add any two numbers together, as demonstrated by the examples provided.

The solution is a simple JavaScript function that uses the built-in `+` operator to add the two numbers together. The function is defined as `add(x, y) => x + y`, where `x` and `y` are the two numbers being added. The function can be called with any two numbers, and it will return their sum. For example, `add(2, 3)` would return `5`, and `add(5, 7)` would return `12`.
