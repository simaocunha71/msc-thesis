```javascript
const add = (x, y) => {
  return x + y;
};

console.log(add(2, 3)); // Output: 5
console.log(add(5, 7)); // Output: 12
```


Explanation:

The task is to create a function called `add` that takes two numbers `x` and `y` as arguments and returns their sum. The function is defined using an arrow function `(x, y) => { ... }`.

Inside the function, the sum of `x` and `y` is calculated using the `+` operator and returned using the `return` statement.

The function is then called with different pairs of numbers using the `console.log` function to demonstrate its functionality. The output of the program is the sum of the input numbers.
