```javascript
const add = (x, y) => x + y;
```
This is a simple function that takes two arguments `x` and `y` and returns their sum. 

You can call this function with two numbers, like `add(2, 3)` or `add(5, 7)`, and it will return their sum. 

For example, `add(2, 3)` will return `5` and `add(5, 7)` will return `12`. 

Note that this function is a pure function, meaning it always returns the same output given the same inputs, and it has no side effects. This makes it a good candidate for use in functional programming. 

Also, this function uses the addition operator (`+`) to add the two numbers. This is a built-in operator in JavaScript that works with numbers. 

You can test this function with different inputs to see that it works correctly. For example, `add(10, 20)` will return `30`. 

This function is a good example of a simple mathematical operation that can be performed using JavaScript. 

You can also use this function in a larger program or with other functions to perform more complex calculations. 

For example, you could use this function to calculate the sum of an array of numbers:
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, current) => add(acc, current), 0);
console.log(sum); // Output: 15
```
In this example, the `reduce` method is used to iterate over the array of numbers and add them up using the `add` function. The `reduce` method takes a callback function as an argument, which is called for each element in the array. The callback function takes two arguments, `acc` and `current`, where `acc` is the accumulator (the running total) and `current` is the current element in the array. The callback function returns the new value of the accumulator, which is then used in the next iteration. The `reduce` method returns the final value of the accumulator, which is the sum of all the numbers in the array. 

You can also use this function with other functions to perform more complex calculations, such as calculating the average of an array of numbers:
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const average = numbers.reduce((acc,
