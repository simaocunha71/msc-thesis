Here is the solution to the problem:

```javascript
const add = (x, y) => {
  return x + y;
};

console.log(add(2, 3)); // Output: 5
console.log(add(5, 7)); // Output: 12
```

Explanation:
The problem asks to create a function called `add` that takes two numbers `x` and `y` as arguments and returns their sum. The function is implemented using an arrow function, which is a concise way to define a function in JavaScript.

The function is then called with two sets of arguments, `(2, 3)` and `(5, 7)`, and the results are logged to the console. The expected outputs are 5 and 12, respectively. The function correctly calculates the sum of the input numbers and returns the result.
