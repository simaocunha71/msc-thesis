```javascript
const add = (x, y) => x + y;

console.log(add(2, 3)); // 5
console.log(add(5, 7)); // 12
```


Explanation:
The problem asks to create a function `add` that takes two numbers `x` and `y` as input and returns their sum. The function can be defined using an arrow function in JavaScript.

In the given code, the `add` function is defined with two parameters `x` and `y`, and it returns their sum using the `+` operator.

The function is then called with two sets of input values, `(2, 3)` and `(5, 7)`, and the results are printed to the console using `console.log`. The output is `5` for the first call and `12` for the second call, which is the expected result.
