```javascript
const add = (x, y) => x + y;
```
Explanation:

The problem asks to create a function `add` that takes two numbers `x` and `y` as arguments and returns their sum. The function should be able to handle any two numbers, not just specific values.

In the solution, we define the `add` function as an arrow function that takes two arguments `x` and `y`. The function simply returns the result of adding `x` and `y` together using the `+` operator.

The function is then tested with two different sets of inputs: `add(2, 3)` and `add(5, 7)`. In both cases, the function returns the correct sum of the input numbers.
