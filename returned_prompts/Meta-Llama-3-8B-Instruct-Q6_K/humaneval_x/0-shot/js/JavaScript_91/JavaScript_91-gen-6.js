The solution to this problem can be achieved by using a simple regular expression to match the sentences that start with the word "I". Here's the implementation:

```javascript
const isBored = (S) => {
  const sentences = S.split(/[.!?]/);
  return sentences.filter(sentence => sentence.trim().startsWith('I')).length;
};
```

Explanation:

1. `S.split(/[.!?]/)` splits the input string into an array of sentences, using the characters `.`, `?`, and `!` as delimiters.
2. `filter(sentence => sentence.trim().startsWith('I'))` filters the sentences that start with the word "I". The `trim()` method is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the sentence.
3. `length` returns the number of sentences that start with the word "I", which represents the number of boredoms.

For example, if the input string is `"The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather"`, the function will split it into an array of sentences: `["The sky is blue", "The sun is shining", "I love this weather"]`. Then, it will filter out the sentences that start with the word "I", resulting in an array of length 1. Therefore, the function will return `1`, indicating that there is one boredom in the input string.
