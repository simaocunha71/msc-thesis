```
function isBored(S) {
  let boredomCount = 0;
  let sentences = S.split(/(?:\.(?:\s|$)|\?(?:\s|$)|\!(?:\s|$))/g);
  for (let sentence of sentences) {
    if (sentence.trim().startsWith('I')) {
      boredomCount++;
    }
  }
  return boredomCount;
}
```

Explanation:
The code defines a function `isBored` that takes a string `S` as input. It initializes a variable `boredomCount` to 0 to count the number of boredoms.

It then splits the input string `S` into an array of sentences using a regular expression that matches the end of a sentence (either a dot, question mark, or exclamation mark, followed by a space or the end of the string). This is done using the `split` method with a regular expression as the separator.

The code then iterates over the array of sentences using a `for...of` loop. For each sentence, it checks if the sentence starts with the word "I" (ignoring leading and trailing whitespace) using the `startsWith` method. If it does, it increments the `boredomCount` variable.

Finally, the code returns the `boredomCount` variable, which represents the number of boredoms in the input string.
