function isBored(S) {

    let boredCount = 0;

    for (const sentence of sentences) {
        if (sentence.trim().startsWith('I')) {

Explanation:
The task is to count the number of sentences that start with the word "I". We achieve this by splitting the input string into an array of sentences using regular expression `/[.!?]/`, which matches the characters '.', '?', and '!'. 

Then, we iterate over each sentence in the array, trim the sentence (to remove leading and trailing spaces), and check if it starts with the word "I" using the `startsWith` method. If it does, we increment the `boredCount`. 

Finally, we return the `boredCount`, which represents the number of boredoms (sentences that start with the word "I") in the input string. 

The `trim` method is used to remove leading and trailing spaces from each sentence, to ensure that sentences like "   I love this weather" are correctly identified as boredoms. 

The `startsWith` method is used to check if a sentence starts with the word "I", ignoring case sensitivity. This ensures that sentences like "I love this weather" and "i love this weather" are both correctly identified as boredoms. 

The function `isBored` takes a string `S` as input, splits it into sentences, counts the number of sentences that start with the word "I", and returns the count. 

This function can be used to count the number of boredoms in a given string, as shown in the example. 

For example, `isBored("Hello world")` returns `0`, because there are no sentences that start with the word "I" in the input string. 

`isBored("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather")` returns `1`, because there is one sentence that starts with the word "I" in the input string.
