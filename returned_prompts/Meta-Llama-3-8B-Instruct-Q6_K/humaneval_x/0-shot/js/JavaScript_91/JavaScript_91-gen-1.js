The problem is asking to count the number of sentences that start with the word "I". A sentence is a sequence of characters that is terminated by a period (.), question mark (?), or exclamation mark (!).

We can solve this problem by iterating over the string and checking each sentence to see if it starts with the word "I". We can use a regular expression to split the string into sentences and then check each sentence.

Here is the solution in JavaScript:
```
const isBored = (S) => {
  let boredomCount = 0;
  const sentences = S.split(/[^.!?]+/);
  for (const sentence of sentences) {
    if (sentence.trim().startsWith('I')) {
      boredomCount++;
    }
  }
  return boredomCount;
};
```
Here's an explanation of how the code works:

1. We initialize a variable `boredomCount` to 0, which will be used to count the number of boredoms.
2. We use the `split()` method to split the input string `S` into an array of sentences. The regular expression `/[^.!?]+/` matches one or more characters that are not a period, question mark, or exclamation mark. This effectively splits the string into sentences.
3. We iterate over the array of sentences using a `for...of` loop.
4. For each sentence, we use the `trim()` method to remove any leading or trailing whitespace, and then check if the sentence starts with the word "I" using the `startsWith()` method. If it does, we increment the `boredomCount`.
5. Finally, we return the `boredomCount` at the end of the function.

You can test the function with the examples provided in the problem statement:
```
console.log(isBored("Hello world")); // 0
console.log(isBored("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather")); // 1
```
