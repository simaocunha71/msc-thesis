Here is a Python solution that uses the concept of Memoization to store the Fibonacci numbers and their primality. It also uses a helper function to check if a number is prime.

```Python
def is_prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def primeFib(n):
    memo = {0: 0, 1: 1}
    a, b = 0, 1
    count = 1
    while True:
        a, b = b, a + b
        if is_prime(b):
            if count == n:
                return b
            memo[count] = b
            count += 1
        if count > n:
            break
    return memo.get(n, None)
```
This function works by generating Fibonacci numbers and checking if they are prime. The first prime Fibonacci number that is the nth number is returned. The function uses a dictionary to store the Fibonacci numbers and their primality, which is helpful for checking if a number is prime without having to recheck it. The helper function `is_prime` checks if a number is prime by checking if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. This function is used to check if a Fibonacci number is prime. The `primeFib` function returns the nth prime Fibonacci number. If no such number exists, it returns `None`. This function is efficient because it uses memoization to store the Fibonacci numbers and their primality, which reduces the number of times it needs to check if a number is prime. This makes the function much faster for larger values of `n`.
