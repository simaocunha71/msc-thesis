Explanation:
The problem asks to calculate the sum of squares of odd numbers in a given list. We need to iterate over the list, filter out non-integer and negative numbers, and then check if the remaining numbers are odd. If they are, we add their squares to the sum. Finally, we return the sum.

The code uses a for...of loop to iterate over the list. We use the typeof operator to check if the current element is a number. We also use the modulo operator (%) to check if the number is positive and if it's an integer (by checking if the remainder is 0). If the number is odd (i.e., the remainder is not 0), we add its square to the sum.

Note that we use the ** operator to calculate the square of the number. This is the correct way to calculate the square in JavaScript, as the ^ operator is used for bitwise XOR operations. The ** operator is the exponentiation operator, which returns the result of raising the left operand to the power of the right operand. In this case, we use it to calculate the square of the number (i.e., the result of raising the number to the power of 2).
