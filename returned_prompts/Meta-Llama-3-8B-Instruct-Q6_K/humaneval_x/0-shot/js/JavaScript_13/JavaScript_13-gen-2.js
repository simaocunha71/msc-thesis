```
  if (b === 0) {
    return a;
  }
  return greatestCommonDivisor(b, a % b);
}
```


Explanation:
The function greatestCommonDivisor takes two integers a and b as input and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD is the largest positive integer that divides both a and b without leaving a remainder.

The function uses a recursive approach to find the GCD. If b is 0, the function returns a, since a is the GCD of a and 0. Otherwise, the function calls itself with b and the remainder of a divided by b.

For example, to find the GCD of 25 and 15, the function would recursively call itself as follows:

* greatestCommonDivisor(25, 15) = greatestCommonDivisor(15, 25 % 15) = greatestCommonDivisor(15, 10) = greatestCommonDivisor(10, 15 % 10) = greatestCommonDivisor(10, 5) = greatestCommonDivisor(5, 10 % 5) = greatestCommonDivisor(5, 0) = 5

So, the GCD of 25 and 15 is 5.

The function works for all positive integers a and b, and is efficient because it only requires a constant amount of additional memory to store the recursive function calls. It also uses a simple and intuitive approach to find the GCD, making it easy to understand and modify.
