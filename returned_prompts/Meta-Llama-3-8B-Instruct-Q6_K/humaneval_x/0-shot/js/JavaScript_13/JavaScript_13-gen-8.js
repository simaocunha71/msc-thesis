Explanation:
This function uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b`. The algorithm works by repeatedly replacing `a` and `b` with `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, respectively, until `b` becomes 0. At that point, `a` is the GCD of the original `a` and `b`.

In this implementation, the base case is when `b` is 0, in which case the GCD is `a`. Otherwise, the function calls itself recursively with `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b` as the new arguments. This process continues until `b` is 0, at which point the function returns the GCD.

For example, when `a` is 3 and `b` is 5, the function calls itself recursively as follows:

* `greatestCommonDivisor(3, 5)` calls `greatestCommonDivisor(5, 3)`
* `greatestCommonDivisor(5, 3)` calls `greatestCommonDivisor(3, 2)`
* `greatestCommonDivisor(3, 2)` calls `greatestCommonDivisor(2, 1)`
* `greatestCommonDivisor(2, 1)` calls `greatestCommonDivisor(1, 0)`
* `greatestCommonDivisor(1, 0)` returns 1 (since `b` is 0)

Therefore, the GCD of 3 and 5 is 1. Similarly, when `a` is 25 and `b` is 15, the function calls itself recursively as follows:

* `greatestCommonDivisor(25, 15)` calls `greatestCommonDivisor(15, 10)`
* `greatestCommonDivisor(15, 10)` calls `greatestCommonDivisor(10, 5)`
* `greatestCommonDivisor(10, 5)` calls `greatestCommonDivisor(5, 0)`
* `greatestCommonDivisor(5, 0)` returns 5 (since `b` is 0)

Therefore, the GCD
