```javascript
const encodeCyclic = (s) => {
  let encoded = '';
  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i += 3) {
    if (i + 3 <= s.length) {
      encoded += s.slice(i + 1, i + 3) + s[i];
    } else {
      encoded += s.slice(i);
    }
  }
  return encoded;
};

const decodeCyclic = (s) => {
  let decoded = '';
  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    if (i > 0 && i % 3 === 0) {
      decoded += s[i - 1];
    }
    decoded += s[i];
  }
  return decoded;
};
```


These functions, encodeCyclic and decodeCyclic, are used to encode and decode a string by cycling groups of three characters. The encodeCyclic function takes a string as input and returns an encoded string by cycling the characters in groups of three. The decodeCyclic function takes an encoded string as input and returns the original string by reversing the cycling operation.

Here's a breakdown of how these functions work:

1. encodeCyclic:
	* The function iterates over the input string in chunks of three characters.
	* For each chunk, it checks if the chunk has exactly three characters. If it does, it takes the second and third characters and moves them to the beginning of the chunk, effectively "cycling" the characters.
	* If the chunk has fewer than three characters, it simply appends the chunk as is to the encoded string.
	* The encoded string is returned as the output.
2. decodeCyclic:
	* The function iterates over the encoded string, character by character.
	* For each character, it checks if it's the third character in a group of three. If it is, it moves the previous character to the beginning of the group, effectively "un-cycling" the characters.
	* The decoded string is returned as the output.

Here's an example of how these functions can be used:

```javascript
const originalString = 'hello world';
const encodedString = encodeCyclic(originalString);
console.log(encodedString); // Output: 'lohel olldwor'

const decodedString = decodeCyclic(encodedString);
console.log(decodedString); // Output: 'hello world'
```


Note that these functions assume that the input string is a sequence of Unicode code
