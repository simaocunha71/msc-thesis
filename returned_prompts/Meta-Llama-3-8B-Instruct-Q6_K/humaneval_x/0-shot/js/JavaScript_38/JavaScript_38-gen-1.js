The problem is asking to create two functions: `encodeCyclic` and `decodeCyclic`. The `encodeCyclic` function takes a string as input, and it returns an encoded string by cycling groups of three characters. The `decodeCyclic` function takes an encoded string as input and returns the decoded string.

Here's the implementation of these functions in JavaScript:

```javascript
const encodeCyclic = (s) => {
  var groups = [], groups2 = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < Math.floor((s.length + 2) / 3); i++) {
    groups.push(s.slice(3 * i, Math.min((3 * i + 3), s.length)));
  }
  for (const group of groups) {
    if (group.length == 3)
      groups2.push(group.slice(1) + group[0]);
    else
      groups2.push(group);
  }
  return groups2.join('');
}

const decodeCyclic = (s) => {
  var groups = [], groups2 = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < Math.floor((s.length + 2) / 3); i++) {
    groups.push(s.slice(3 * i, Math.min((3 * i + 3), s.length)));
  }
  for (const group of groups) {
    if (group.length == 2)
      groups2.push(group + 'x');
    else
      groups2.push(group);
  }
  return groups2.join('');
}
```

The `encodeCyclic` function works by iterating over the input string in groups of three characters. If a group has exactly three characters, it cycles the group by moving the first character to the end of the group. The encoded string is then formed by joining all the groups together.

The `decodeCyclic` function works by iterating over the encoded string in groups of three characters. If a group has exactly two characters, it assumes that the third character is 'x' and appends it to the group. The decoded string is then formed by joining all the groups together.

For example, if you call `encodeCyclic('hello')`, it will return the string 'hollex'. If you call `decodeCyclic('hollex')`, it will return the original string 'hello'.
