```
const belowZero = (operations) => {
  let balance = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < operations.length; i++) {
    balance += operations[i];
    if (balance < 0) {
      return true;
    }
  }
  return false;
};
```

Explanation:
The function `belowZero` takes a list of operations as an argument. It initializes the balance to 0. Then, it iterates through the operations and adds each operation to the balance. If the balance becomes negative at any point, the function returns `true`. If the function has iterated through all operations without the balance becoming negative, it returns `false`. This ensures that the function detects if the balance of the account falls below zero at any point and returns the appropriate result.
