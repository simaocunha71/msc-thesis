The problem can be solved by iterating over the operations and keeping track of the balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, we return true. If we finish iterating without the balance falling below zero, we return false.

Here is a JavaScript solution:

```javascript
const belowZero = (operations) => {
  let balance = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < operations.length; i++) {
    balance += operations[i];
    if (balance < 0) {
      return true;
    }
  }
  return false;
};
```

This function takes an array of operations as input. It initializes a balance variable to zero. Then, it iterates over the operations, adding each operation to the balance. If the balance ever falls below zero, it immediately returns true. If it finishes iterating without the balance falling below zero, it returns false.

For example, if we call `belowZero([1, 2, 3])`, the function will return false because the balance never falls below zero. If we call `belowZero([1, 2, -4, 5])`, the function will return true because the balance falls below zero when it's subtracted by 4.
