The task is to write a function `belowZero` that takes a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account as input. The function should return `true` if at any point the balance of the account falls below zero, and `false` otherwise.

Here's a possible implementation in JavaScript:
```
const belowZero = (operations) => {
  let balance = 0;
  for (const operation of operations) {
    balance += operation;
    if (balance < 0) {
      return true;
    }
  }
  return false;
};
```
Here's an explanation of how the function works:

1. We initialize the `balance` variable to 0, which represents the initial balance of the account.
2. We iterate through the `operations` array using a `for...of` loop.
3. For each operation, we add it to the `balance` variable. If the operation is a deposit, the balance will increase, and if it's a withdrawal, the balance will decrease.
4. We check if the `balance` is less than 0. If it is, we immediately return `true` because the account balance has fallen below zero.
5. If we reach the end of the loop without finding a balance below zero, we return `false` because the account balance remains non-negative throughout the operations.

You can test the function with the examples you provided:
```
console.log(belowZero([1, 2, 3])); // false
console.log(belowZero([1, 2, -4, 5])); // true
```
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions. ðŸ˜Š
```
```python
def below_zero(operations):
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```python
```
The function `below_zero` takes a list of operations as input and returns `True` if at any point the balance of the account falls below zero, and `False` otherwise.
