```
const belowZero = (operations) => {
  let balance = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < operations.length; i++) {
    balance += operations[i];
    if (balance < 0) {
      return true;
    }
  }
  return false;
};
```
Explanation:
The function `belowZero` takes a list of operations as input. It initializes a variable `balance` to 0, which represents the current balance of the bank account. It then iterates over each operation in the list. For each operation, it adds the operation to the `balance`. If at any point the `balance` falls below 0, it immediately returns `true`. If it finishes iterating over the list without finding a negative balance, it returns `false`. This ensures that it detects the first point at which the balance falls below zero, if any. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of operations. The space complexity is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space.
