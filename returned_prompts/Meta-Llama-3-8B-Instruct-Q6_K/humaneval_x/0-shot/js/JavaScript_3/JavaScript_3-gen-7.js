```
const belowZero = (operations) => {
  let balance = 0;
  for (const operation of operations) {
    balance += operation;
    if (balance < 0) {
      return true;
    }
  }
  return false;
};
```


The code defines a function `belowZero` that takes a list of deposit and withdrawal operations as an argument. It initializes a variable `balance` to 0, which represents the current balance of the account. It then iterates over the operations, adding each operation to the balance. If the balance ever falls below 0, it immediately returns `true`. If it gets through all the operations without the balance falling below 0, it returns `false`.

For example, `belowZero([1, 2, 3])` would return `false` because the balance remains positive throughout, while `belowZero([1, 2, -4, 5])` would return `true` because the balance falls below 0 after the withdrawal of 4.
