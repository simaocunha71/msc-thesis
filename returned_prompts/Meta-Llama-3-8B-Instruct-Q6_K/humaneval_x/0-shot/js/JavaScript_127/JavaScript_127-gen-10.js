Here is the solution to the problem:
```
const intersection = (interval1, interval2) => {
  const [start1, end1] = interval1;
  const [start2, end2] = interval2;

  // Check if the intervals intersect
  if (start1 > end2 || start2 > end1) {
    return "NO";
  }

  // Calculate the intersection
  const start = Math.max(start1, start2);
  const end = Math.min(end1, end2);

  // Calculate the length of the intersection
  const length = end - start + 1;

  // Check if the length is a prime number
  if (length <= 1) {
    return "NO";
  }

  for (let i = 2; i * i <= length; i++) {
    if (length % i === 0) {
      return "NO";
    }
  }

  return "YES";
};
```
Explanation:

1. First, we check if the intervals intersect by comparing the start and end points. If they don't intersect, we return "NO".
2. If the intervals intersect, we calculate the start and end points of the intersection.
3. We calculate the length of the intersection by subtracting the start point from the end point and adding 1 (because the interval is closed).
4. We check if the length is a prime number by iterating from 2 to the square root of the length and checking if the length is divisible by any of these numbers. If it is, we return "NO".
5. If the length is not divisible by any of these numbers, we return "YES". If the length is 1, we also return "NO" because 1 is not considered a prime number.

This solution has a time complexity of O(sqrt(n)) where n is the length of the intersection, because we iterate from 2 to the square root of the length to check if it's a prime number. The space complexity is O(1) because we only use a constant amount of space to store the start and end points of the intervals and the length of the intersection.
