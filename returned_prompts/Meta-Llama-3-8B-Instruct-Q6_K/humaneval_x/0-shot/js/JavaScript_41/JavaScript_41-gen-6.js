This problem is a variation of the "Range Sum Query" problem. The idea is to use a sliding window approach to solve this problem. 

Here is the solution:
```
const carRaceCollision = (n) => {
    let collisions = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (i !== j) {
                collisions += Math.min(i, j);
            }
        }
    }
    return collisions;
}
```
Explanation:
In this problem, we are trying to find the number of collisions that will occur. Since the cars are moving at the same speed, the number of collisions that will occur is equal to the sum of the minimum of the two cars' positions.

We can use two nested loops to iterate over all pairs of cars. For each pair, we can calculate the minimum of the two cars' positions and add it to the total number of collisions.

In the outer loop, we iterate over the left-moving cars. In the inner loop, we iterate over the right-moving cars. If the current left-moving car is not the same as the current right-moving car, we calculate the minimum of their positions and add it to the total number of collisions.

Finally, we return the total number of collisions.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) and a space complexity of O(1). It is efficient for small values of n, but it may not be efficient for large values of n. In that case, a more efficient solution using a different algorithm may be needed.
