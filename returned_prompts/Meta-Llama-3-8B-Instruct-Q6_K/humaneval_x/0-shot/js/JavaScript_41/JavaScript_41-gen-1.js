This problem is a classic example of a "collision problem" in computer science, where objects move in a straight line and collide with each other. In this case, we have two sets of `n` cars moving in opposite directions, and we want to count the number of collisions.

Here is a simple and efficient solution in JavaScript:
```
const carRaceCollision = (n) => {
  let collisions = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      if (i !== j && Math.abs(i - j) % 2 === 1) {
        collisions++;
      }
    }
  }
  return collisions;
};
```
Here's an explanation of the code:

* We initialize a variable `collisions` to 0, which will keep track of the number of collisions.
* We use two nested loops to iterate over the `n` cars in both directions. The outer loop iterates over the cars moving left to right, and the inner loop iterates over the cars moving right to left.
* We check if the current car moving left to right (`i`) collides with the current car moving right to left (`j`). We do this by checking if `i` is not equal to `j` (to avoid counting self-collisions) and if the absolute difference between `i` and `j` is odd (since cars moving in opposite directions will have an odd distance between them).
* If the cars collide, we increment the `collisions` variable.
* Finally, we return the total number of collisions.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2), which is efficient enough for small to moderate values of `n`. For larger values of `n`, you may want to consider a more efficient algorithm or a more advanced data structure.
