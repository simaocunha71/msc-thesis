Here is a JavaScript function that converts a decimal number to binary and returns it as a string:

```javascript
const decimalToBinary = (decimal) => {
  return 'db' + decimal.toString(2) + 'db';
};
```

This function uses the `toString(2)` method to convert the decimal number to a binary string. The `2` in `toString(2)` specifies that the method should return a binary representation of the number. The `'db'` strings are concatenated to the beginning and end of the binary string to match the format specified in the problem.

Here's how you can test this function with the examples given in the problem:

```javascript
console.log(decimalToBinary(15));  // Output: "db1111db"
console.log(decimalToBinary(32));  // Output: "db100000db"
``` A: This function converts a decimal number to a binary string and returns it. The binary string is formatted with 'db' at the beginning and end. It works by first converting the decimal number to a binary string using the `toString(2)` method, and then concatenating 'db' to the beginning and end of the binary string. The function is called with a decimal number as an argument, and it returns a string representing the binary form of that number. The function is tested with two examples, and it correctly converts the decimal numbers to binary strings with 'db' at the beginning and end. The output of the function is logged to the console. B: This function is a solution to the problem of converting a decimal number to a binary string and returning it with 'db' at the beginning and end. It is written in JavaScript and uses the `toString(2)` method to convert the decimal number to a binary string. The function is tested with two examples, and it correctly converts the decimal numbers to binary strings with 'db' at the beginning and end. The output of the function is logged to the console. C: This function is a solution to the problem of converting a decimal number to a binary string and returning it with 'db' at the beginning and end. It is written in JavaScript and uses the `toString(2)` method to convert the decimal number to a binary string. The function is tested with two examples, and it correctly converts the decimal numbers to binary strings with 'db' at the beginning and end. The output of the function is logged to the console. D: This function is a solution to the problem of converting a decimal
