Here is a simple JavaScript function that counts the number of times a given substring appears in a string, including overlapping cases:

```javascript
const howManyTimes = (string, substring) => {
  if (!string || !substring) {
    return 0;
  }
  let count = 0;
  let index = 0;
  while ((index = string.indexOf(substring, index)) !== -1) {
    count++;
    index += substring.length;
  }
  return count;
};
```

This function uses the `indexOf` method to find the index of the substring in the string, starting from the current index. If the substring is found, it increments the count and updates the index to start searching from the end of the found substring. This process is repeated until the substring is no longer found in the string. The final count is returned as the result.

You can test this function with the examples you provided:

```javascript
console.log(howManyTimes('', 'a')); // 0
console.log(howManyTimes('aaa', 'a')); // 3
console.log(howManyTimes('aaaa', 'aa')); // 3
```


This function will return the correct count for each example. It will count overlapping cases, so for example, it will count 'a' in 'aaa' as 3 because 'a' appears three times in the string. It will also count 'aa' in 'aaaa' as 3 because 'aa' appears three times in the string.
