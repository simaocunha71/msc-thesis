```javascript
const countDistinctCharacters = (string) => {
  const charSet = new Set();
  for (let char of string.toLowerCase()) {
    charSet.add(char);
  }
  return charSet.size;
};

console.log(countDistinctCharacters('xyzXYZ')); // 3
console.log(countDistinctCharacters('Jerry')); // 4
```
Explanation:
The task is to count the number of distinct characters in a given string, ignoring the case. We can achieve this by using a Set in JavaScript. A Set is a collection of unique items. We convert the string to lowercase and iterate over each character. For each character, we add it to the Set. Finally, we return the size of the Set, which represents the number of distinct characters.

The code first creates a new Set, then iterates over the characters in the input string (converted to lowercase to ignore case). For each character, it adds the character to the Set. Since a Set only allows unique items, duplicates are automatically removed. Finally, the code returns the size of the Set, which is the number of distinct characters in the input string.

The output of the code will be:
```
3
4
```
For the inputs 'xyzXYZ' and 'Jerry', respectively. The first output indicates that the string 'xyzXYZ' contains 3 distinct characters, and the second output indicates that the string 'Jerry' contains 4 distinct characters.
