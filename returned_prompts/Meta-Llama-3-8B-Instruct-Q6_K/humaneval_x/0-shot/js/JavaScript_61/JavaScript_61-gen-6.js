```javascript
const correctBracketing = (brackets) => {
  const stack = [];
  for (const bracket of brackets) {
    if (bracket === "(") {
      stack.push(bracket);
    } else if (bracket === ")") {
      if (stack.length === 0) {
        return false;
      }
      stack.pop();
    }
  }
  return stack.length === 0;
};
```



Explanation:

1. We use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets.
2. We iterate through the string of brackets.
3. When we encounter an opening bracket, we push it onto the stack.
4. When we encounter a closing bracket, we check if the stack is empty. If it is, that means there is no corresponding opening bracket, so we return false.
5. If the stack is not empty, we pop the opening bracket from the stack.
6. After iterating through all the brackets, we check if the stack is empty. If it is, that means every opening bracket had a corresponding closing bracket, so we return true. If the stack is not empty, that means there are some opening brackets without corresponding closing brackets, so we return false.
