```
const correctBracketing = (brackets) => {
  const stack = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < brackets.length; i++) {
    if (brackets[i] === "(") {
      stack.push(brackets[i]);
    } else if (brackets[i] === ")") {
      if (stack.length === 0) {
        return false;
      }
      stack.pop();
    }
  }
  return stack.length === 0;
};
```

Explanation:
The function `correctBracketing` takes a string of brackets as an argument. It initializes an empty stack. Then it iterates over the string. If it encounters an opening bracket, it pushes it onto the stack. If it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means there is no corresponding opening bracket, so it returns `false`. If the stack is not empty, it pops the opening bracket from the stack. After iterating over the entire string, it checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means every opening bracket had a corresponding closing bracket, so it returns `true`. If the stack is not empty, it means there were some opening brackets without corresponding closing brackets, so it returns `false`.
