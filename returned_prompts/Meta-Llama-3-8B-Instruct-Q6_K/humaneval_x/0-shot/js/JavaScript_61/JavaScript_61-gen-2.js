const correctBracketing = (brackets) => {
  let stack = [];
  for (let bracket of brackets) {
    if (bracket === "(") {
      stack.push(bracket);
    } else if (bracket === ")") {
      if (stack.length === 0) {
        return false;
      }
      stack.pop();
    }

  return stack.length === 0;

Explanation:
The problem is asking to check if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. We can use a stack data structure to solve this problem. We iterate through the brackets string. If we encounter an opening bracket, we push it onto the stack. If we encounter a closing bracket, we check if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means there is no corresponding opening bracket for the closing bracket, so we return false. If the stack is not empty, we pop the opening bracket from the stack. After iterating through all the brackets, we check if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so we return true. If the stack is not empty, it means there are some opening brackets that do not have corresponding closing brackets, so we return false.
