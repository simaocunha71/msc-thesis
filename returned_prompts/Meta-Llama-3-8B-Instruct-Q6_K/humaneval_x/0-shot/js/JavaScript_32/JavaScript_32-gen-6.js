The `findZero` function is intended to find a root of a polynomial equation, i.e., a value of `x` such that `poly(xs, x) = 0`. However, the implementation is not correct. It does not correctly calculate the root of the polynomial and does not handle the case when there are multiple roots.

Here is a corrected implementation of the `findZero` function using the `fsolve` function from the `scipy.optimize` module:

```
const { fsolve } = require('scipy.optimize');

const findZero = (xs) => {
  const n = xs.length;
  const coeffs = new Array(n);
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    coeffs[i] = xs[i];
  }
  return fsolve(poly, 0, coeffs).toFixed(2);
};
```

This implementation assumes that the input `xs` is a list of coefficients of a polynomial, and that the largest non-zero coefficient is at the beginning of the list. It uses the `fsolve` function to find a root of the polynomial and returns the result as a string with two decimal places.

Note that this implementation is not guaranteed to find all roots of the polynomial, and it may not work correctly for all polynomials. In particular, it may not work correctly if the polynomial has multiple roots or if the roots are complex. For more robust root finding, you may need to use a more advanced algorithm or a specialized library.
