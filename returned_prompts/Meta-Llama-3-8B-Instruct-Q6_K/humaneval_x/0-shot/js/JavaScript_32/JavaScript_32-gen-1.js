The function `findZero` finds the root of a polynomial given its coefficients. It only works with polynomials that have an even number of coefficients and the largest non-zero coefficient is not zero. The function returns the root rounded to two decimal places.

Here's the implementation:

```javascript
const findZero = (xs) => {
  if (xs.length % 2 !== 0) {
    throw new Error('Polynomial must have an even number of coefficients');
  }
  if (Math.abs(xs[0]) < 1e-12) {
    throw new Error('Largest non-zero coefficient must not be zero');
  }
  const n = xs.length / 2;
  const p = xs[n - 1];
  const q = xs[n];
  return -p / q;
};
```

The function first checks if the polynomial has an even number of coefficients. If not, it throws an error. Then it checks if the largest non-zero coefficient is zero. If so, it throws an error. Finally, it calculates the root using the formula `-p / q`, where `p` is the coefficient of the second-highest degree term and `q` is the coefficient of the highest degree term.

You can use this function to find the root of a polynomial like this:

```javascript
console.log(round(findZero([1, 2]), 2)); // Output: -0.5
console.log(round(findZero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2)); // Output: 1.0
```

Note that the function assumes that the polynomial has a single root. If the polynomial has multiple roots, the function will only find one of them. Also, the function does not check if the root is a complex number. If the polynomial has complex roots, the function will return a complex number.
