Here is the solution to the problem:

```javascript
const histogram = (test) => {
  if (!test) return {};

  let frequency = {};
  let maxCount = 0;

  for (let char of test.split(' ')) {
    if (!frequency[char]) {
      frequency[char] = 0;
    }
    frequency[char]++;
    if (frequency[char] > maxCount) {
      maxCount = frequency[char];
    }
  }

  let result = {};
  for (let char in frequency) {
    if (frequency[char] === maxCount) {
      result[char] = maxCount;
    }
  }

  return result;
};
```

This solution works by first splitting the input string into individual characters using the `split` method. Then, it iterates over the characters and updates a frequency object to keep track of the count of each character. It also keeps track of the maximum frequency seen so far.

After that, it iterates over the frequency object and adds each character with the maximum frequency to the result object. Finally, it returns the result object.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because it needs to iterate over each character in the string once. The space complexity is also O(n), because in the worst case, all characters in the string could be unique.
