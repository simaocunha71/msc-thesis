This function first splits the input strings into their numerator and denominator parts and converts them to numbers. Then it calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator using the Euclidean algorithm. It then simplifies the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their GCD. Finally, it checks if the simplified denominator is 1, which means the original product is a whole number. If it is, the function returns true; otherwise, it returns false. This approach ensures that the function correctly handles all possible cases, including those where the GCD is 1.
