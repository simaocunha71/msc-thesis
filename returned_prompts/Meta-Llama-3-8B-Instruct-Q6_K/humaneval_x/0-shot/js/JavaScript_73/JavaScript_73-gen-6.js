The function smallestChange takes an array as input and returns the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array palindromic.

Here is the solution:
```javascript
const smallestChange = (arr) => {
  const n = arr.length;
  let left = 0, right = n - 1;
  let count = 0;

  while (left < right) {
    if (arr[left] !== arr[right]) {
      count++;
      right--;
      if (right < left) {
        left++;
      }
    } else {
      left++;
      right--;
    }
  }

  return count;
};
```
Here's an explanation of the solution:

1. We initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start and end of the array respectively.
2. We loop until `left` meets `right` or `right` becomes less than `left`.
3. Inside the loop, we check if the elements at `left` and `right` are equal. If they are not equal, we increment the `count` variable and decrement `right`. If `right` becomes less than `left`, we increment `left`.
4. If the elements at `left` and `right` are equal, we increment both `left` and `right`.
5. The `count` variable keeps track of the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array palindromic.
6. Finally, we return the `count` variable.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the `left`, `right`, and `count` variables.
