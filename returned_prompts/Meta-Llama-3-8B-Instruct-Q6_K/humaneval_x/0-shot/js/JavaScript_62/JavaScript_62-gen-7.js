return xs.slice(1).map((x, i) => x * (i + 1))

Explanation:
The function `derivative` takes an array `xs` as an argument, which represents the coefficients of a polynomial. The function returns the derivative of the polynomial in the same form.

The derivative of a polynomial is calculated by multiplying each coefficient by its corresponding power. The power of a coefficient is one more than its index in the array.

The `slice(1)` method is used to exclude the first element of the array, which corresponds to the constant term in the polynomial. The `map` method is used to apply the multiplication operation to each element in the array.

The `i` variable is used to represent the power of each coefficient, which is one more than its index in the array. The `x` variable represents the coefficient itself.

For example, if the input array is `[3, 1, 2, 4, 5]`, the function will return `[1, 4, 12, 20]`, which are the coefficients of the derivative polynomial `x + 2x + 4x^2 + 5x^3`. If the input array is `[1, 2, 3]`, the function will return `[2, 6]`, which are the coefficients of the derivative polynomial `2 + 6x`. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array, because it iterates over the array once. The space complexity is also O(n), because it creates a new array to store the result.
