return xs.slice(1).map((x, i) => x * (i + 1));

Explanation:

The derivative of a polynomial is obtained by differentiating each term and multiplying the result by the power of the variable. In the context of the given problem, the polynomial is represented as an array of coefficients `xs`, where `xs[i]` represents the coefficient of `x^i`.

The function `derivative` takes an array `xs` as input and returns the derivative of the polynomial in the same form.

Here's the step-by-step implementation:

1. `xs.slice(1)` returns a new array that excludes the first element of `xs`, which corresponds to the constant term in the polynomial.
2. `map` is used to apply a transformation to each element of the sliced array.
3. The transformation is a function that takes two arguments: `x` (the current element) and `i` (the index of the element). The function returns the result of multiplying `x` by `i + 1`, which corresponds to the derivative of the term `x^i`.
4. The resulting array is returned as the derivative of the polynomial.

For example, if the input is `[3, 1, 2, 4, 5]`, the function will return `[1, 4, 12, 20]`, which are the coefficients of the derivative polynomial `x + 2x + 4x^2 + 5x^3`. If the input is `[1, 2, 3]`, the function will return `[2, 6]`, which are the coefficients of the derivative polynomial `2 + 6x`.
