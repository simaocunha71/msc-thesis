Explanation:
The derivative of a polynomial is defined as the polynomial where each term is multiplied by its degree. In other words, the derivative of `x^n` is `n * x^(n-1)`.

In the given problem, we are given a polynomial in the form of an array `xs`, where `xs[i]` represents the coefficient of `x^i`. We need to calculate the derivative of this polynomial, also in the same form.

The solution uses the `slice` method to get all elements of the array except the first one, and then uses the `map` method to calculate the derivative of each term. The derivative of `x^i` is `i * x^(i-1)`, so we multiply each term by its degree (`i + 1`).

The result is an array of coefficients representing the derivative of the original polynomial.

For example, if the input is `[3, 1, 2, 4, 5]`, the derivative will be `[1, 4, 12, 20]`, which is the result of multiplying each term by its degree: `1 * 1`, `4 * 2`, `12 * 3`, and `20 * 4`. Similarly, if the input is `[1, 2, 3]`, the derivative will be `[2, 6]`, which is the result of multiplying each term by its degree: `2 * 1` and `6 * 2`.
