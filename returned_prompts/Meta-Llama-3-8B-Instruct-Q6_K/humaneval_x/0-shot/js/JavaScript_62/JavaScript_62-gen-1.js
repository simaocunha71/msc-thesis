```javascript
const derivative = (xs) => xs.slice(1).map((x, i) => x * (i + 1));
```
Explanation:

The problem is asking to find the derivative of a polynomial represented as an array of coefficients, where `xs[0]` is the constant term, `xs[1]` is the coefficient of the linear term, `xs[2]` is the coefficient of the quadratic term, and so on.

The derivative of a polynomial is a new polynomial whose coefficients are the derivatives of the original polynomial's coefficients. Specifically, the derivative of `xs[i] * x^i` is `xs[i] * i * x^(i-1)`.

We can use the `slice` method to get the coefficients of the polynomial starting from the second element (since the derivative of the constant term is 0), and then use the `map` method to calculate the derivative of each coefficient. The derivative of `xs[i]` is `xs[i] * (i + 1)`, since the derivative of `x^i` is `i * x^(i-1)`.

Here's the implementation in JavaScript:
```javascript
const derivative = (xs) => xs.slice(1).map((x, i) => x * (i + 1));
```
For example, if we call `derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])`, it will return `[1, 4, 12, 20]`, which are the coefficients of the derivative of the polynomial `3 + x + 2x^2 + 4x^3 + 5x^4`. Similarly, if we call `derivative([1, 2, 3])`, it will return `[2, 6]`, which are the coefficients of the derivative of the polynomial `1 + 2x + 3x^2`.
