```
return xs.slice(1).map((x, i) => x * (i + 1));
```
Explanation:

The derivative of a polynomial is obtained by replacing each coefficient with the product of the coefficient and its power. In other words, the derivative of `xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + ...` is `xs[1] + 2 * xs[2] * x + 3 * xs[3] * x^2 + ...`.

In the code above, we use `slice(1)` to remove the first element of the array (since it's a constant term and doesn't contribute to the derivative). Then, we use `map` to apply the transformation to each element of the array. The transformation is `x * (i + 1)`, where `x` is the current element and `i` is its index.

For example, if we have `xs = [3, 1, 2, 4, 5]`, the code will return `[1, 4, 12, 20]`, which are the coefficients of the derivative polynomial.

The time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the length of the input array, since we only need to iterate over the array once to compute the derivative. The space complexity is also O(n), since we need to create a new array to store the result.
