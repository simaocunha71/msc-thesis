```javascript
const sumSquares = (lst) => {
  return lst.map((x) => Math.ceil(x) ** 2).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
};
```


Explanation:
The problem asks to sum the squares of the numbers in the list after rounding each number to the upper integer (ceiling) using the `Math.ceil()` function.

Here's how the solution works:

1. `lst.map((x) => Math.ceil(x) ** 2)`: This line maps each number `x` in the list to its ceiling value using `Math.ceil(x)`, and then squares the result using `** 2`.
2. `reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0)`: This line reduces the resulting array of squares to a single sum using the `reduce()` method. The initial value of the accumulator `a` is set to `0`.

By combining these two operations, we get the sum of the squares of the numbers in the list after rounding each number to the upper integer.
