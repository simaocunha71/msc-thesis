Here is a possible implementation of the `antiShuffle` function:
```
const antiShuffle = (s) => {
  return s.split(' ').map(word => word.split('').sort((a, b) => a.charCodeAt(0) - b.charCodeAt(0)).join('')).join(' ');
};
```
Here's an explanation of how the function works:

1. `s.split(' ')` splits the input string into an array of words, using spaces as the separator.
2. `map()` is used to apply a transformation to each word in the array. The transformation is a function that takes a word, splits it into an array of characters, sorts the characters in ascending order based on their ASCII values, and joins the sorted characters back into a string.
3. `join(' ')` is used to join the sorted words back into a single string, using spaces as the separator.
4. The resulting string is returned as the output of the `antiShuffle` function.

You can test the function with the examples you provided:
```
console.log(antiShuffle('Hi')); // Output: "Hi"
console.log(antiShuffle('hello')); // Output: "ehllo"
console.log(antiShuffle('Hello World!!!')); // Output: "Hello !!!Wdlor"
```
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions. ðŸ˜Š

Note: This implementation assumes that the input string only contains spaces as word separators. If the input string can contain other types of whitespace characters (such as tabs, newlines, etc.), you may need to modify the implementation accordingly.
