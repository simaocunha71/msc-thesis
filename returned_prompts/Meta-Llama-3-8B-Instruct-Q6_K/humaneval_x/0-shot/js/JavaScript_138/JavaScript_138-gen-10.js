Here is a JavaScript solution for the problem:

```javascript
const isEqualToSumEven = (n) => {
    for (let i = 2; i <= n; i += 2) {
        let sum = 0;
        for (let j = 2; j <= n; j += 2) {
            if (sum + j > n) break;
            sum += j;
            if (sum === n) return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
};
```

This function iterates over all even numbers from 2 to `n` and checks whether any subset of these even numbers sums up to `n`. It uses a nested loop to generate all possible subsets of even numbers and checks whether the sum of the subset equals `n`. If it finds such a subset, it returns `true`. If no such subset is found after checking all possible subsets, it returns `false`. 

This function has a time complexity of O(n^2), where `n` is the input number. This is because it checks all possible subsets of even numbers up to `n`, which takes O(n^2) time. The space complexity is O(1), which means it uses a constant amount of space. 

Note that the function does not need to check all numbers from 1 to `n` because it only needs to check even numbers. This is why it starts the inner loop from 2 and increments the loop variable by 2 in each iteration. 

Also, the function does not need to check subsets of more than 4 even numbers because the problem statement specifies that the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers is required. Therefore, the outer loop only needs to iterate up to `n/2` to ensure that the sum of 4 even numbers does not exceed `n`. However, the function still checks all possible subsets of even numbers up to `n` because it is not known in advance whether a subset of 4 even numbers sums up to `n` or not. 

In practice, this function may not be efficient for large values of `n` because its time complexity is quadratic. However, for small to medium-sized values of `n`, it should work correctly and efficiently. 

For example, `isEqualToSumEven(8)` returns `true` because 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8, and `isEqualToSumEven(6)` returns `false` because there is no way to write 6 as the sum
