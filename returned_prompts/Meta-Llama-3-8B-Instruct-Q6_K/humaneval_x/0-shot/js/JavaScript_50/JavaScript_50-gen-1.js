The problem is asking to create a function that takes a string as input and returns the encoded string by shifting every character in the alphabet by 5 positions. For example, if the input string is "hello", the encoded string would be "mjqqt".

The function should also be able to decode the encoded string back to the original string. This means that if the input string is the encoded string "mjqqt", the function should return the original string "hello".

Here is the solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
const encodeShift = (s) => {
  return s.split("").map(ch => String.fromCharCode(
    ((ch.charCodeAt(0) + 5 - "a".charCodeAt(0)) % 26) + "a".charCodeAt(0)
  )).join("");
}

const decodeShift = (s) => {
  return s.split("").map(ch => String.fromCharCode(
    ((ch.charCodeAt(0) - 5 - "a".charCodeAt(0)) % 26) + "a".charCodeAt(0)
  )).join("");
}

// Test the functions
console.log(encodeShift("hello")); // Output: "mjqqt"
console.log(decodeShift("mjqqt")); // Output: "hello"
```

In this solution, the `encodeShift` function uses the `map` method to iterate over each character in the input string. For each character, it calculates the ASCII code of the character shifted by 5 positions in the alphabet. The `String.fromCharCode` method is then used to convert the calculated ASCII code back to a character.

The `decodeShift` function is similar to the `encodeShift` function, but it shifts the characters in the opposite direction, by subtracting 5 from the ASCII code instead of adding 5. This effectively reverses the encoding process and returns the original string.
