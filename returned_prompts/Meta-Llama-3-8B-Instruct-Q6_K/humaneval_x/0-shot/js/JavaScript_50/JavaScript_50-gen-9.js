```
const decodeShift = (s) => {
  return s.split("").map(ch => String.fromCharCode(
    ((ch.charCodeAt(0) - "a".charCodeAt(0) + 26) % 26) + "a".charCodeAt(0)
  )).join("");
}
```


Explanation:
- The `encodeShift` function takes a string `s` as input and returns the encoded string by shifting every character by 5 in the alphabet.
- The `decodeShift` function takes an encoded string `s` as input and returns the decoded string by shifting every character back by 5 in the alphabet.

In both functions, we use the `String.fromCharCode` method to convert the ASCII value of a character to its corresponding character in the alphabet. We use the modulo operator `% 26` to ensure that the character is shifted within the alphabet (i.e., wrapping around from 'z' to 'a' if necessary).

In the `encodeShift` function, we add 5 to the ASCII value of each character, and in the `decodeShift` function, we subtract 5 from the ASCII value of each character. We also use the `charCodeAt(0)` method to get the ASCII value of each character, and the `split("")` method to split the string into individual characters.

Finally, we use the `join("")` method to concatenate the decoded characters back into a string.
