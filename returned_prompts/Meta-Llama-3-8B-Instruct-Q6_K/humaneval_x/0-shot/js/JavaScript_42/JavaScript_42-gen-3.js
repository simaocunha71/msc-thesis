```
const incrList = (l) => l.map(x => x + 1);
```


Explanation:
This function uses the `map` method to iterate over each element in the input list `l`. For each element `x`, it returns a new value that is the result of adding 1 to `x`. The resulting list of incremented values is then returned. This is a simple and efficient way to increment each element in the list by 1.
