Here is a JavaScript solution for the problem:

```javascript
const factorize = (n) => {
  const factors = [];
  let divisor = 2;
  while (n > 1) {
    let count = 0;
    while (n % divisor === 0) {
      n /= divisor;
      count++;
    }
    if (count > 0) {
      factors.push(Array(count + 1).fill(divisor));
    }
    divisor++;
  }
  return factors.flat();
};
```

In this solution, we start by initializing an empty array `factors` to store the prime factors. We also initialize a variable `divisor` to 2, which will be used to find the factors of the input number `n`.

We then enter a while loop that continues until `n` is reduced to 1. Inside the loop, we find the factors of `n` by dividing it by `divisor` as long as it is divisible. We keep track of the count of divisions using the `count` variable.

Once we have found all the factors of `n` with respect to `divisor`, we push an array of `count + 1` `divisor`s to the `factors` array. This is because we want to store the prime factors along with their counts.

Finally, we increment `divisor` by 1 and repeat the process until `n` is reduced to 1.

After the loop, we flatten the `factors` array using the `flat()` method and return the result. The `flat()` method is used to flatten the array of arrays into a single array.

The time complexity of this solution is O(√n), where n is the input number. This is because we are dividing `n` by `divisor` until it is reduced to 1, and the maximum value of `divisor` is √n. The space complexity is O(1), as we are using a fixed amount of space to store the factors and the count.
