Here is a Python solution that implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all primes up to the square root of the input number, and then iterates over the primes to find the prime factors of the input number.

```Python
def factorize(n):
    i = 2
    factors = []
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            while n % i == 0:
                factors.append(i)
                n //= i
        i += 1
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```
This solution first checks if the input number `n` is divisible by `i` (starting from 2). If it is, it divides `n` by `i` as many times as possible (i.e., until `n` is no longer divisible by `i`), and adds `i` to the list of factors. It then increments `i` by 1 and repeats the process until `i * i` is greater than `n`. If `n` is still greater than 1 after this process, it means that `n` is a prime number, so it adds `n` to the list of factors. The function then returns the list of factors. 

This solution is efficient because it only needs to iterate up to the square root of the input number to find all its prime factors. This is because a larger factor of the input number would have already been found as a smaller factor. 

For example, if the input number is 8, the function will first find that 2 is a factor of 8, and then find that 2 is also a factor of 4 (which is the result of dividing 8 by 2). It will then divide 4 by 2 again, and since 4 is no longer divisible by 2, it will stop. The function will then return the list `[2, 2, 2]`. 

This solution is also easy to understand and implement, and it works for large input numbers. 

However, it's worth noting that this solution is not the most efficient solution for very large input numbers, because it needs to iterate over all numbers up to the square root of the input number. For very large input numbers, a more efficient solution might be needed. 

Also, the solution does not handle the case where the input number is less than
