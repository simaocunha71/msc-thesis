Here is the solution for the problem:

```javascript
const factorize = (n) => {
  const factors = [];
  let i = 2;
  while (i * i <= n) {
    if (n % i) {
      i++;
    } else {
      n /= i;
      factors.push(i);
    }
  }
  if (n > 1) {
    factors.push(n);
  }
  return factors;
};
```

In this solution, we start by initializing an empty array `factors` to store the prime factors. We also initialize a variable `i` to 2, which will be used to iterate through the numbers from 2 to the square root of `n`.

In the while loop, we check if `n` is divisible by `i`. If it is, we divide `n` by `i` and add `i` to the `factors` array. We repeat this process until `i` is greater than the square root of `n`.

After the while loop, if `n` is greater than 1, it means that `n` is a prime number, so we add it to the `factors` array.

Finally, we return the `factors` array, which contains the prime factors of the input number `n` in the order from smallest to largest, with each factor repeated the number of times it appears in the factorization.
