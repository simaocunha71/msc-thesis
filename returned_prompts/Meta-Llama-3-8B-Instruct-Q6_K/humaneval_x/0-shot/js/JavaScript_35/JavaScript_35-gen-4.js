```javascript
const maxElement = (l) => {
  return Math.max(...l);
};
```


Explanation:

The function `maxElement` takes a list `l` as an argument and returns the maximum element in the list. The `Math.max` function is used to find the maximum element in the list. The `...` operator is used to spread the list into separate arguments for the `Math.max` function.

For example, if the list is `[1, 2, 3]`, the `Math.max` function will be called with arguments `1`, `2`, and `3`, and it will return `3`, which is the maximum element in the list.

The function can handle lists of any length, including empty lists. If the list is empty, the `Math.max` function will return `Infinity`, which can be handled by checking if the result is `Infinity` before returning it. However, since the problem statement does not specify what to do if the list is empty, the function will simply return `Infinity` in this case.

The function can also handle lists that contain non-numeric elements. In this case, the `Math.max` function will ignore the non-numeric elements and return the maximum numeric element in the list. For example, if the list is `[1, 2, 'a', 3, 4]`, the function will return `4`, which is the maximum numeric element in the list.
