The problem is asking to write a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the maximum number in the list. 

Here is a simple solution in Python:
```
def maxElement(l):
    return max(l)
```
This solution uses the built-in `max` function in Python, which returns the largest item in an iterable or the largest of two or more arguments. 

For example, if we call `maxElement([1, 2, 3])`, it will return `3`, which is the maximum number in the list. Similarly, if we call `maxElement([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])`, it will return `123`, which is the maximum number in the list. 

This solution is efficient and easy to understand, and it works for lists of any size. 

Here is the equivalent solution in JavaScript:
```
function maxElement(l) {
    return Math.max(...l);
}
```
This solution uses the `Math.max` function, which returns the largest of its arguments. The `...` operator is used to spread the elements of the list into separate arguments for the `Math.max` function. 

For example, if we call `maxElement([1, 2, 3])`, it will return `3`, which is the maximum number in the list. Similarly, if we call `maxElement([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])`, it will return `123`, which is the maximum number in the list. 

This solution is also efficient and easy to understand, and it works for lists of any size. 

It's worth noting that the `max` function in Python and the `Math.max` function in JavaScript are both designed to work with iterables, such as lists, tuples, and arrays. They will automatically find the maximum value in the iterable, without requiring you to write a loop or other iteration mechanism. This makes them very convenient to use, and they are often the best choice when you need to find the maximum value in a list.
