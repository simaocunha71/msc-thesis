The task is to check whether the given list of strings can be concatenated in a way that the resulting string is balanced. A string is considered balanced if every open parenthesis has a corresponding close parenthesis.

We can solve this problem by using a stack data structure. We iterate over the concatenated string and push every open parenthesis onto the stack. When we encounter a close parenthesis, we check if the stack is empty. If it is, it means there is no corresponding open parenthesis and we return 'No'. If the stack is not empty, we pop the top element (which is an open parenthesis) from the stack. At the end, if the stack is empty, it means every open parenthesis has been closed and we return 'Yes'. If the stack is not empty, it means there are open parentheses without corresponding closes and we return 'No'.

Here is the JavaScript code for the problem:

```javascript
const matchParens = (lst) => {
    let stack = [];
    for (let str of lst) {
        for (let char of str) {
            if (char === '(') {
                stack.push(char);
            } else if (char === ')') {
                if (stack.length === 0) {
                    return 'No';
                }
                stack.pop();
            }
        }
    }
    return stack.length === 0 ? 'Yes' : 'No';
};
```

In this code, we first initialize an empty stack. Then, we iterate over each string in the list. For each character in the string, we check if it is an open parenthesis. If it is, we push it onto the stack. If it is a close parenthesis, we check if the stack is empty. If it is, we return 'No'. If the stack is not empty, we pop the top element from the stack. At the end, if the stack is empty, we return 'Yes'. If the stack is not empty, we return 'No'. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the total number of characters in the list of strings. The space complexity is O(n), where n is the total number of open parentheses in the list of strings.
