const correctBracketing = (brackets) => {
  let openBrackets = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < brackets.length; i++) {
    if (brackets[i] === "<") {
      openBrackets++;
    } else if (brackets[i] === ">") {
      if (openBrackets === 0) {
        return false; // no matching opening bracket
      }
      openBrackets--;
    }
  }
  return openBrackets === 0; // all brackets matched, or no brackets at all
};
```

Explanation:
We iterate over the string of brackets, keeping track of the number of open brackets (i.e., "<"). When we encounter a closing bracket (">"), we check if there's a matching opening bracket. If there isn't, we immediately return `false`. If we reach the end of the string and there are still open brackets left, it means there are unmatched opening brackets, so we also return `false`. If we've processed the entire string and there are no unmatched open brackets, we return `true`. This ensures that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.
