Here is the solution:
```
const correctBracketing = (brackets) => {
  let openingBrackets = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < brackets.length; i++) {
    if (brackets[i] === "<") {
      openingBrackets++;
    } else if (brackets[i] === ">") {
      if (openingBrackets === 0) return false;
      openingBrackets--;
    }
  }
  return openingBrackets === 0;
};
```
Explanation:

* We initialize a counter `openingBrackets` to 0, which will keep track of the number of opening brackets that have not been closed.
* We iterate through the `brackets` string.
* When we encounter an opening bracket `"<"`, we increment `openingBrackets`.
* When we encounter a closing bracket `">"`, we check if `openingBrackets` is 0. If it is, it means there are no opening brackets left to close, so we return `false`. Otherwise, we decrement `openingBrackets`.
* After iterating through the entire string, we check if `openingBrackets` is 0. If it is, it means every opening bracket had a corresponding closing bracket, so we return `true`. Otherwise, we return `false`.
