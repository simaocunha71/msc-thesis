const correctBracketing = (brackets) => {
  const stack = [];
  for (const bracket of brackets) {
    if (bracket === "<") {
      stack.push("<");
    } else if (bracket === ">") {
      if (stack.length === 0 || stack.pop() !== "<") {
        return false;
      }
    }
  }
  return stack.length === 0;
};
```
Explanation:

We use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. When we encounter an opening bracket, we push it onto the stack. When we encounter a closing bracket, we check if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack does not match the closing bracket. If either condition is true, we return false. If we finish iterating over the brackets and the stack is empty, we return true. If the stack is not empty, it means there are unmatched opening brackets, so we return false.
