    } else if (bracket === '>') {
      if (stack.length === 0 || stack.pop() !== '<') {

Explanation:
The function `correctBracketing` takes a string of brackets as input and returns `false` if every opening bracket does not have a corresponding closing bracket. The function uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets.

The function iterates over the input string. For each character:
* If the character is an opening bracket ('<'), it pushes it onto the stack.
* If the character is a closing bracket ('>'), it checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack does not match with the closing bracket. If either condition is true, it returns `false`. Otherwise, it pops the opening bracket from the stack.

After iterating over the entire string, the function checks if the stack is empty. If it is, it means that every opening bracket had a corresponding closing bracket, so it returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.
