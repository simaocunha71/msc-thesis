```javascript
const correctBracketing = (brackets) => {
  let stack = [];
  for (let char of brackets) {
    if (char === "<") {
      stack.push(char);
    } else if (char === ">") {
      if (stack.length === 0) {
        return false; // no matching opening bracket
      }
      stack.pop();
    }
  }
  return stack.length === 0;
};
```


Explanation:
The function `correctBracketing` checks if every opening bracket in the string `brackets` has a corresponding closing bracket. It uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets.

- It iterates over each character in the string. If the character is an opening bracket (`"<"`), it pushes it onto the stack.
- If the character is a closing bracket (`">"`), it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, it means there's no matching opening bracket, so it returns `false`.
- If the stack is not empty, it pops the opening bracket from the stack, effectively matching the closing bracket.
- After iterating over all characters, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, it means all opening brackets were matched with closing brackets, so it returns `true`. If the stack is not empty, it means there are unmatched opening brackets, so it returns `false`.
