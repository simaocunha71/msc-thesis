```javascript
const correctBracketing = (brackets) => {
  let stack = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < brackets.length; i++) {
    if (brackets[i] === "<") {
      stack.push("<");
    } else if (brackets[i] === ">") {
      if (stack.length === 0) {
        return false;
      }
      stack.pop();
    }
  }
  return stack.length === 0;
};
```


Explanation:
This function uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. It iterates over the input string, and for each character:
- If it's an opening bracket, it pushes it onto the stack.
- If it's a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, it means there's no corresponding opening bracket, so it returns false. Otherwise, it pops the opening bracket from the stack.
Finally, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, it means all opening brackets had corresponding closing brackets, so it returns true. If the stack is not empty, it means there were some opening brackets without corresponding closing brackets, so it returns false.
