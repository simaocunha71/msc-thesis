Explanation:
The function `search` takes a list `lst` of positive integers as input.
It first creates an object `freqMap` to store the frequency of each number in the list.
It then iterates over the list, and for each number, it increments its frequency in the `freqMap`.
After that, it iterates over the `freqMap`, and for each number, it checks if the number is greater than 0 and its frequency is greater than or equal to the number itself.
If such a number is found, it returns the number.
If no such number is found, it returns -1.

The function uses a dictionary (object) to store the frequency of each number, which allows for efficient lookup and update of the frequency. The function also uses a for...of loop to iterate over the `freqMap`, which allows for easy iteration over the key-value pairs of the dictionary. The function uses the Object.entries() method to get an array of key-value pairs from the `freqMap`, which allows for easy iteration over the dictionary. The function uses the if statement to check if the number is greater than 0 and its frequency is greater than or equal to the number itself, which allows for efficient filtering of the numbers. The function returns the first number that meets the condition, which is the greatest integer that is greater than zero, and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself.

The function also handles the case where no such number exists, by returning -1. This is because the problem statement specifies that if no such number exists, the function should return -1. The function is able to handle this case because it iterates over the `freqMap` and checks each number, and if no number meets the condition, it returns -1. The function is also able to handle the case where the list contains duplicate numbers, because the `freqMap` stores the frequency of each number, and the function uses the frequency to determine if the number meets the condition. The function is also able to
