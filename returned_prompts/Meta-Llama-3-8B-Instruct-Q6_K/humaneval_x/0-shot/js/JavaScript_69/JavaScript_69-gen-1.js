The problem asks to find the greatest integer in the list that has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself. If no such value exists, return -1.

We can solve this problem by iterating over the list and keeping track of the maximum integer that meets the condition. Here is the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
const search = (lst) => {
    let max = -1;
    let freq = {};
    for (let num of lst) {
        if (!freq[num]) {
            freq[num] = 0;
        }
        freq[num]++;
        if (freq[num] >= num && num > max) {
            max = num;
        }
    }
    return max;
};
```

In this implementation, we first initialize `max` to -1, which will be the default value if no such integer is found. We also initialize an empty object `freq` to keep track of the frequency of each integer.

Then, we iterate over the list and for each integer, we increment its frequency in the `freq` object. We also check if the frequency of the current integer is greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself, and if it is greater than the current `max` value. If both conditions are met, we update `max` to the current integer.

Finally, we return `max`, which is the greatest integer that meets the condition. If no such integer is found, `max` will still be -1.
