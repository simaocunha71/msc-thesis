```javascript
const getMaxTriples = (n) => {
  let count = 0;
  for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    for (let j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
      for (let k = j + 1; k <= n; k++) {
        if ((i * i - i + 1 + j * j - j + 1 + k * k - k + 1) % 3 === 0) {
          count++;
        }
      }
    }
  }
  return count;
};
```
Explanation:
The problem asks to find the number of triples (a[i], a[j], a[k]) of an array a of length n, where i < j < k, and a[i] + a[j] + a[k] is a multiple of 3.

We use a three nested loop to generate all possible triples. The outer loop iterates over the array from the first element to the second last element (i), the middle loop iterates over the array from the second element to the last element (j), and the inner loop iterates over the array from the third element to the last element (k).

For each triple, we check if the sum of the elements is a multiple of 3 by using the modulo operator (%). If it is, we increment the count.

Finally, we return the count, which represents the number of valid triples.

Time complexity: O(n^3)
Space complexity: O(1) (since we are not using any additional space that scales with the input size)
