```
let count = 0;
for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    for (let j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
        for (let k = j + 1; k <= n; k++) {
            if ((i * i - i + 1 + j * j - j + 1 + k * k - k + 1) % 3 === 0) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }
}
return count;
```
This solution has a time complexity of O(n^3) because it uses three nested loops to generate all possible triples and check if their sum is a multiple of 3. The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the count and the loop variables.

You can optimize the solution by noticing that the sum of three consecutive terms in the sequence is always a multiple of 3 (because each term is 1 more than a multiple of 3). Therefore, you only need to check if the sum of the first two terms is a multiple of 3, and if it is, you can increment the count by the number of terms that are 1 more than a multiple of 3.

Here is the optimized solution:
```
const getMaxTriples = (n) => {
    let count = 0;
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if ((i * i - i + 1) % 3 === 0) {
            count += Math.floor((n - i) / 3);
        }
    }
    return count;
};
```
This solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1). It is much more efficient than the original solution for large values of n.
