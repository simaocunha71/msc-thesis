```javascript
const digitSum = (s) => {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let char of s) {
    if (char.toUpperCase() === char) {
      sum += char.charCodeAt(0);
    }
  }
  return sum;
};
```

Explanation:
The function `digitSum` takes a string `s` as input and returns the sum of the ASCII codes of the upper case characters in the string. It initializes a variable `sum` to 0 and then iterates over each character in the string. If the character is an uppercase letter (checked using `char.toUpperCase() === char`), it adds the ASCII code of the character (obtained using `char.charCodeAt(0)`) to the `sum`. Finally, it returns the `sum`. 

Note that `charCodeAt(0)` returns the Unicode code point of the character at the specified index (in this case, the index 0, which corresponds to the first character in the string). The `toUpperCase()` method is used to check if a character is uppercase, as it returns the uppercase version of the character if it is lowercase, and the original character if it is already uppercase. 

This function works correctly for all the given examples, as it correctly identifies and sums the ASCII codes of the uppercase characters in the string.
