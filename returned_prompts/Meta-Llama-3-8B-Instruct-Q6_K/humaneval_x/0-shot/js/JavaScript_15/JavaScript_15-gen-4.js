```javascript
const stringSequence = (n) => Array.from({ length: n + 1 }, (_, i) => i).join(' ');
```


Explanation:
The solution uses the `Array.from()` method to create an array of numbers from 0 to `n` (inclusive). The callback function passed to `Array.from()` is a simple identity function `(_, i) => i`, which returns the index `i` for each element in the array.

The `join(' ')` method is then used to concatenate the elements of the array into a single string, with each element separated by a space. The resulting string is the desired sequence of space-delimited numbers.
