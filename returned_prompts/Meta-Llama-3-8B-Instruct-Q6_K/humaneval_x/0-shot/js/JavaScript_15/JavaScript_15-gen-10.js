```javascript
const stringSequence = (n) => {
  let result = '';
  for (let i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
    result += i + ' ';
  }
  return result.trim();
};
```


Explanation:
The function `stringSequence` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 up to `n` inclusive.

Inside the function, we initialize an empty string `result`. Then, we use a `for` loop to iterate from 0 to `n`. In each iteration, we concatenate the current number `i` with a space character to `result`. Finally, we use the `trim` method to remove the trailing space from the result and return it.

For example, if `n` is 5, the function will return the string `'0 1 2 3 4 5'`. If `n` is 0, the function will return the string `'0'`.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) because it iterates `n` times. The space complexity is O(n) as well, because in the worst case, the `result` string can contain `n+1` characters (the numbers and the spaces).
