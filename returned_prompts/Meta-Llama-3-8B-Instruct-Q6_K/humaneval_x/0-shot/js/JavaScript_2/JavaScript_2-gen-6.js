Here is the solution for the problem:

```javascript
const truncateNumber = (number) => {
  return number - Math.floor(number);
};
```

Explanation:
The problem asks for the decimal part of a given positive floating point number. The decimal part can be obtained by subtracting the integer part (obtained using `Math.floor()`) from the original number. 

For example, if the input number is 3.5, `Math.floor(3.5)` returns 3, and subtracting 3 from 3.5 gives us the decimal part, which is 0.5. Similarly, for 4.2, `Math.floor(4.2)` returns 4, and subtracting 4 from 4.2 gives us the decimal part, which is 0.2. 

So, the solution is to simply subtract the integer part from the original number. This is implemented in the `truncateNumber` function provided above. 

Note: The function will work correctly for any positive floating point number, including those with more than one decimal digit. For example, `truncateNumber(4.234)` will return `0.234`.  Also, the function does not round the number to any specific number of decimal places, it simply returns the decimal part as is. If you want to round the number to a specific number of decimal places, you would need to use a different approach.
