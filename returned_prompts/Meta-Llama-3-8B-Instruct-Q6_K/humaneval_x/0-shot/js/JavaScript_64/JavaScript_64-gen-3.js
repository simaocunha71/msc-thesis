Here is a possible implementation of the `vowelsCount` function:
```
const vowelsCount = (s) => {
  const vowels = 'aeiou';
  let count = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    const char = s[i].toLowerCase();
    if (vowels.includes(char)) {
      count++;
    }
  }
  return count;
};
```
Here's an explanation of how the function works:

1. We define a string `vowels` that contains all the vowels we're interested in (a, e, i, o, u).
2. We initialize a variable `count` to 0, which will keep track of the number of vowels in the input string.
3. We loop through each character `char` in the input string `s`.
4. For each character, we convert it to lowercase using the `toLowerCase()` method, so that we can compare it to the vowels string without worrying about case.
5. We check if the character is in the `vowels` string using the `includes()` method. If it is, we increment the `count` variable.
6. Finally, we return the `count` variable, which now holds the total number of vowels in the input string.

This function should work correctly for the examples you provided:
```
console.log(vowelsCount("abcde")); // Output: 2
console.log(vowelsCount("ACEDY")); // Output: 3
```
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
