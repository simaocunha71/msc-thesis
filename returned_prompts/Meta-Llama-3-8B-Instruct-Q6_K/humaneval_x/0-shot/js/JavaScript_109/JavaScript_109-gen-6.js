The function checks if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing right shift operations. It does this by iterating through the array and checking if the current element is greater than the next element. If it is, the function returns false, indicating that the array cannot be sorted in non-decreasing order. If the function finishes iterating through the array without finding any elements that are greater than the next element, it returns true, indicating that the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order.

Here is the JavaScript code for the function:
```
const moveOneBall = (arr) => {
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
    if (arr[i] > arr[i + 1]) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
};
```
This function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array, because it only iterates through the array once. It also has a space complexity of O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the current element and the next element.
