Here is a possible solution for the problem:
```
const chooseNum = (x, y) => {
  if (x > y) {
    return -1;
  }
  for (let i = x; i <= y; i++) {
    if (i % 2 === 0) {
      return i;
    }
  }
  return -1;
};
```
This function first checks if `x` is greater than `y`. If it is, it returns -1 because there are no even numbers in the range `[y, x]`. Then it loops through all numbers in the range `[x, y]` and checks if each number is even by using the modulo operator (`%`). If it finds an even number, it returns that number. If it doesn't find any even numbers in the range, it returns -1.

For example, if you call `chooseNum(12, 15)`, it will return `14` because `14` is the biggest even number in the range `[12, 15]`. If you call `chooseNum(13, 12)`, it will return `-1` because there are no even numbers in the range `[13, 12]`.
