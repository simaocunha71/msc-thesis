The problem can be solved by first checking if the given list is balanced (i.e., it's a palindrome) and then checking if the sum of its elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight. Here's the solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
const willItFly = (q, w) => {
  const qStr = q.join('');
  return qStr === qStr.split('').reverse().join('') && q.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0) <= w;
};
```

In this solution, we first convert the given list into a string. Then, we check if the string is equal to its reverse. If it is, then the list is balanced (palindromic). Next, we calculate the sum of the elements in the list using the `reduce` method. Finally, we check if the sum is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight. If both conditions are met, we return `true`; otherwise, we return `false`.
