```
const willItFly = (q, w) => {
  // Check if the object q is balanced (palindromic list)
  if (!q.every((element, index) => element === q[q.length - 1 - index])) {
    return false;
  }
  // Check if the sum of the object q's elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight w
  if (q.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0) > w) {
    return false;
  }
  // If both conditions are met, return true
  return true;
};
```


Here's an explanation of the code:
- We first check if the object q is balanced by comparing each element with its corresponding element from the end of the array. If any element does not match, we immediately return false.
- Next, we check if the sum of the object q's elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight w using the reduce method to sum up all the elements in the array. If the sum is greater than w, we return false.
- If both conditions are met, we return true, indicating that the object q will fly.
