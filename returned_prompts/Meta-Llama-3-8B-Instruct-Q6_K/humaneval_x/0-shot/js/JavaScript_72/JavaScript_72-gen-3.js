```
const willItFly = (q, w) => {
  // Check if the object q is balanced (a palindromic list)
  if (!q.every((element, index) => element === q[q.length - 1 - index])) {
    return false;
  }
  // Check if the sum of the object q's elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight w
  return q.reduce((acc, current) => acc + current, 0) <= w;
};
```


Note: This function first checks if the object q is a palindromic list by comparing each element with the corresponding element from the end of the list. If the object q is not a palindromic list, the function immediately returns false.

After that, the function uses the reduce() method to calculate the sum of the object q's elements. If the sum is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight w, the function returns true; otherwise, it returns false.
