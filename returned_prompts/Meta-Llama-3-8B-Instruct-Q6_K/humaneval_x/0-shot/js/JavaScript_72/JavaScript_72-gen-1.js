Here is the solution:
```
const willItFly = (q, w) => {
  // Check if the object q is balanced (palindromic)
  const isBalanced = q.join('') === q.join('').split('').reverse().join('');
  
  // Calculate the sum of the elements in q
  const sum = q.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
  
  // Return true if the object q is balanced and the sum of its elements is less than or equal the maximum possible weight w
  return isBalanced && sum <= w;
};
```
This function first checks if the object `q` is balanced by comparing it with its reverse. Then, it calculates the sum of the elements in `q` using the `reduce` method. Finally, it returns `true` if `q` is balanced and the sum of its elements is less than or equal to `w`, and `false` otherwise.
