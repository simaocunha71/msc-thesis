The function willItFly checks whether the object q will fly or not. It does this by first checking if the sum of the elements in q is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight w. If it is, then it checks if the list is balanced (i.e., it is a palindrome). If both conditions are met, then the function returns true, indicating that q will fly. Otherwise, it returns false.

Here is the JavaScript function that implements this logic:
```javascript
const willItFly = (q, w) => {
  const sum = q.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
  if (sum > w) return false;
  return q.join('') === q.join('').split('').reverse().join('');
}
```
Here's how you can test this function with the examples provided:
```javascript
console.log(willItFly([1, 2], 5)); // false
console.log(willItFly([3, 2, 3], 1)); // false
console.log(willItFly([3, 2, 3], 9)); // true
console.log(willItFly([3], 5)); // true
```
Note: The reduce() method is used to calculate the sum of the elements in the array q. The join() method is used to convert the array to a string, and then the split() method is used to split the string into an array of characters. The reverse() method is used to reverse the array of characters, and then the join() method is used again to convert the array back into a string. The === operator is used to check if the original string is equal to the reversed string, which is a palindrome. If it is, then the function returns true, indicating that q is balanced. Otherwise, it returns false.
