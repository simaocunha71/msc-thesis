This problem asks you to write a function that takes an integer N as input, converts it to a binary string, and then returns the total sum of the digits in the binary string. For example, if the input is 1000, the output should be "1", because there is only one '1' in the binary representation of 1000.

The function `solve` first converts the integer N to a binary string using the `toString(2)` method. Then it initializes a variable `sum` to 0. It then loops through each character in the binary string, and if the character is '1', it adds 1 to the `sum`. Finally, it returns the `sum` as a string.

The test cases show that the function works correctly for inputs 1000, 150, and 147. For example, the binary representation of 1000 is '1000', and there is only one '1', so the output is "1". The binary representation of 150 is '11101010', and there are six '1's, so the output is "6". The binary representation of 147 is '10010111', and there are four '1's, so the output is "4".
