```
const multiply = (a, b) => {
  return (a % 10) * (b % 10);
};
```
Explanation:
The function takes two integers a and b as input. It uses the modulus operator (%) to get the remainder of the division of each number by 10, which gives the unit digit of each number. Then it multiplies these two unit digits together and returns the result. This approach ensures that the function works correctly regardless of the sign of the input numbers. For example, if a is negative, the function will correctly calculate the product of the unit digits of a and b, including the sign. 

Note that this function does not handle non-integer inputs. If you want to handle non-integer inputs, you would need to add error checking code to handle those cases. 

For example, if you want to handle non-integer inputs, you could add a check at the beginning of the function to make sure that both inputs are integers. If either input is not an integer, you could throw an error or return a special value to indicate that the input is invalid. Here is an example of how you could add this check:

```
const multiply = (a, b) => {
  if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
    throw new Error('Inputs must be numbers');
  }
  return (a % 10) * (b % 10);
};
```
This code checks if both a and b are numbers using the `typeof` operator. If either input is not a number, it throws an error. If both inputs are numbers, it calculates and returns the product of their unit digits as before.
