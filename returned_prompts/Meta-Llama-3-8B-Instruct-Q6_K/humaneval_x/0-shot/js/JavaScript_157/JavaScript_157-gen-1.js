The problem is asking to write a function that takes three side lengths of a triangle as input and returns a boolean indicating whether these sides form a right-angled triangle or not.

Here is the JavaScript solution for the problem:

```
const rightAngleTriangle = (a, b, c) => {
  const sides = [a, b, c];
  sides.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  return sides[0]**2 + sides[1]**2 === sides[2]**2;
};
```

This function first sorts the side lengths in ascending order. Then it checks if the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides is equal to the square of the longest side. If it is, then the triangle is a right-angled triangle and the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

This solution works because in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse side is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. This is known as the Pythagorean theorem. By using this theorem, we can determine whether a triangle is right-angled or not.
