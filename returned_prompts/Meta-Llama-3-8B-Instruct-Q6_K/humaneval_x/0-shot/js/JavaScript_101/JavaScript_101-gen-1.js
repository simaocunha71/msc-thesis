The problem is asking to split a given string into words and return an array of those words. The string may contain both commas and spaces as separators.

Here's a JavaScript solution for the problem:

```javascript
const wordsString = (s) => s.split(/[\s,]+/).filter(word => word !== '');
```

This function uses the `split` method to split the string into words. The regular expression `/[\s,]+/` matches one or more occurrences of either a space or a comma. The `filter` method is used to remove any empty strings from the resulting array.

Here's an explanation of the code:

- `s.split(/[\s,]+/)`: This line splits the string `s` into words using the regular expression `/[\s,]+/` as the separator. The regular expression matches one or more occurrences of either a space or a comma.

- `.filter(word => word !== '')`: This line filters the resulting array to remove any empty strings. The `filter` method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. In this case, the function `word => word !== ''` returns `true` for all words that are not empty strings, effectively removing them from the array.

This solution works for both the given examples:

```javascript
wordsString("Hi, my name is John") // Returns ["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "John"]
wordsString("One, two, three, four, five, six") // Returns ["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]
```



This solution is also efficient and scalable as it uses the built-in `split` and `filter` methods of JavaScript, which are optimized for performance. It also handles cases where the input string may contain multiple spaces or commas in a row, and it does not require any external libraries or dependencies.
