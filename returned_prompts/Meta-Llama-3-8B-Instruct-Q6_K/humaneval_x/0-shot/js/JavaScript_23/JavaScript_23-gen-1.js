```javascript
return string.length;
```
Explanation:
The `length` property of a string in JavaScript returns the length of the string, i.e., the number of characters in the string. So, we can simply return `string.length` to get the length of the given string. This function will work correctly even if the input string is empty, because `''` has a length of 0.
