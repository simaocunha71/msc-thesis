  return string.length;
}

Explanation:
The `strlen` function takes a string as an argument and returns its length. The length of a string is the number of characters it contains. In JavaScript, you can get the length of a string using the `length` property.

For example, if you call `strlen('')`, it will return `0` because an empty string has no characters. If you call `strlen('abc')`, it will return `3` because the string `'abc'` contains 3 characters.

The implementation of the `strlen` function is simple: it just returns the length of the given string. You can use this function to get the length of any string in your code.
