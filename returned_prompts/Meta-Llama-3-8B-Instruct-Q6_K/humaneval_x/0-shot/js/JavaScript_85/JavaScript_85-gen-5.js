```javascript
const add = (lst) => {
    return lst.filter((num, index) => index % 2 !== 0 && num % 2 === 0).reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);
};
```


This solution uses the `filter()` method to create a new array with only the elements that meet the condition `index % 2 !== 0 && num % 2 === 0`, which means the even elements at odd indices. Then, it uses the `reduce()` method to sum up all these elements. The initial value of the accumulator is 0. 

For example, for the input `[4, 2, 6, 7]`, the `filter()` method will create the array `[2, 6]`, and the `reduce()` method will sum them up to get `8`. 

This solution assumes that the input list is non-empty and contains at least one even element at an odd index. If the list is empty or does not contain any even elements at odd indices, the `filter()` method will return an empty array and the `reduce()` method will return 0. 

Note that this solution uses modern JavaScript features like arrow functions and the `filter()` and `reduce()` methods. It is also case-sensitive, so it will not work correctly if the input list contains non-integer values. 

If you want to handle non-integer values or other edge cases, you may need to add additional logic to the solution. 

Here's an example of how you could modify the solution to handle non-integer values:
```javascript
const add = (lst) => {
    return lst.filter((num) => typeof num === 'number' && num % 2 === 0 && lst.indexOf(num) % 2 !== 0).reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);
};
```
This modified solution uses the `typeof` operator to check if each element is a number before checking if it's even and at an odd index. This way, it will ignore non-integer values and only consider the integer values in the list. 

You can test this solution with different inputs to see how it works. For example:
```javascript
console.log(add([4, 2, 6, 7])); // Output: 8
console.log(add([1, 3, 5])); // Output: 0
console.log(add([2, 4, 6])); //
