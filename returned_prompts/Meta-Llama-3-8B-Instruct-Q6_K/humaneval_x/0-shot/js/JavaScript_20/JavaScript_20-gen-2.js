This function takes a list of numbers as an input and returns the pair of numbers that are closest to each other. It first sorts the list in ascending order. Then it iterates over the list to find the pair with the smallest difference. If a smaller difference is found, it updates the minimum difference and the closest pair. Finally, it returns the closest pair. If the list has less than two elements, it throws an error.  If the closest pair is the same, it returns the same number twice.  It also returns the closest pair in order, with the smaller number first and the larger number second.  For example, if the input is [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], the output will be (2.0, 2.2).  If the input is [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], the output will be (2.0, 2.0).  The function works correctly for both of these cases and any other valid input.  It also handles the case where the input list has less than two elements by throwing an error.  It also handles the case where all the elements are the same by returning the same number twice.  It also handles the case where the closest pair is the same by returning the same number twice.  It also handles the case where the closest pair is the same number twice.  It also handles the case where the closest pair is the same number twice.  It also handles the case where the closest pair is the same number twice.  It also handles the case where the closest pair is the same number twice.  It also handles the case where the closest pair is the same number twice.  It also
