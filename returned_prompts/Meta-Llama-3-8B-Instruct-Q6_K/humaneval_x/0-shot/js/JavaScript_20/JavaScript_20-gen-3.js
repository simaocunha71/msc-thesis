```
  let minDiff = Infinity;
  let closestElements = [numbers[0], numbers[0]];
  for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length - 1; i++) {
    const diff = Math.abs(numbers[i] - numbers[i + 1]);
    if (diff < minDiff) {
      minDiff = diff;
      closestElements = [numbers[i], numbers[i + 1]];
    }
  }
  return closestElements;
```
Explanation:

The function takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the two closest numbers in the list. It initializes a variable `minDiff` to infinity, which will be used to keep track of the smallest difference found between two numbers. It also initializes an array `closestElements` to hold the two closest numbers.

The function then iterates over the list of numbers using a for loop. For each pair of adjacent numbers, it calculates the absolute difference between them and checks if this difference is smaller than the current `minDiff`. If it is, it updates `minDiff` and sets `closestElements` to the current pair of numbers.

Finally, the function returns `closestElements`, which contains the two closest numbers in the list.

The function handles the case where the list contains duplicate numbers by returning the same number twice in `closestElements`. This is because the problem statement does not specify what to do in this case, so the function simply returns the duplicate numbers. If you want to handle this case differently, you can modify the function accordingly. For example, you could return the first occurrence of the duplicate number and ignore the rest of the duplicates.
