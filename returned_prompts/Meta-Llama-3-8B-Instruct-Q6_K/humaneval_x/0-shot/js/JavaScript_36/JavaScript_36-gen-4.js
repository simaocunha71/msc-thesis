```javascript
function fizzBuzz(n) {
    let count = 0;
    for (let i = 11; i < n; i += 11) {
        if (i.toString().includes('7')) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    for (let i = 13; i < n; i += 13) {
        if (i.toString().includes('7')) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```


This function iterates over all the numbers less than `n` that are divisible by either 11 or 13, and checks if they contain the digit 7. The count of such numbers is returned. The function uses a simple string comparison to check if the digit 7 is present in the number. This is done by converting the number to a string and checking if it contains the character '7'. If it does, the count is incremented. This process is repeated for all numbers less than `n` that are divisible by 11 or 13, and the final count is returned.
