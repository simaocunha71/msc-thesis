Explanation:
The function `fizzBuzz` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than `n` which are divisible by 11 or 13.

The function uses a for loop to iterate from 11 to `n-1` in steps of 1. For each number `i` in this range, it checks if `i` is divisible by 11 or 13 using the modulo operator `%`. If `i` is divisible by 11 or 13, it converts `i` to a string using `toString()` and then splits the string into an array of characters using `split('')`. It then uses the `filter()` method to create a new array containing only the characters that are equal to '7'. The length of this array is the number of times the digit 7 appears in `i`.

The function also uses a second for loop to iterate from 14 to `n-1` in steps of 1. This is because the numbers divisible by 11 or 13 are 11, 13, 22, 26, 33, 39, 44, 52, 66, 77, 88, 99, and the function should count the number of times the digit 7 appears in these numbers.

Finally, the function returns the total count of times the digit 7 appears in numbers less than `n` which are divisible by 11 or 13.
