```javascript
const fizzBuzz = (n) => {
  let count = 0;
  for (let i = 11; i < n; i++) {
    if (i % 11 === 0 || i % 13 === 0) {
      if (i.toString().includes('7')) {
        count++;
      }
    }
  }
  for (let i = 14; i < n; i++) {
    if (i % 11 === 0 || i % 13 === 0) {
      if (i.toString().includes('7')) {
        count++;
      }
    }

  return count;
};
```


Explanation:
The function `fizzBuzz` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than `n` which are divisible by 11 or 13.

The function uses a for loop to iterate through the integers from 11 to `n-1` (inclusive), and checks if each integer is divisible by 11 or 13 using the modulo operator (`%`). If the integer is divisible by 11 or 13, it converts the integer to a string using `toString()` and checks if the string includes the character '7' using the `includes()` method. If it does, it increments a counter variable `count`.

The function then returns the value of `count`.

The reason for the two separate for loops is that the multiples of 11 and 13 are not consecutive, so we need to check the multiples of 11 separately from the multiples of 13. This ensures that we don't miss any multiples of 11 or 13 that are less than `n`.
