```javascript
const fizzBuzz = (n) => {
  let count = 0;
  for(let i = 11; i < n; i += 11) {
    if(i.toString().includes('7')) {
      count++;
    }
  }
  for(let i = 13; i < n; i += 13) {
    if(i.toString().includes('7')) {
      count++;
    }
  }
  return count;
};
```

Explanation:
The function `fizzBuzz` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than `n` which are divisible by 11 or 13.

We use two for loops to iterate over the numbers less than `n` that are divisible by 11 and 13, respectively. For each number, we convert it to a string using the `toString()` method and check if it includes the digit 7 using the `includes()` method. If it does, we increment the `count` variable.

Finally, we return the `count` variable, which represents the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than `n` which are divisible by 11 or 13.

Note that we start the iteration from 11 and 13 respectively, because we are only interested in numbers that are divisible by these values. We also use the `+=` operator to increment the loop variable by the respective divisor (11 or 13) in each iteration. This ensures that we cover all numbers that are divisible by 11 or 13 less than `n`.
