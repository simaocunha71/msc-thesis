This function first checks if the list has at least three elements. Then it uses the `some` method to check if there is a triplet that sums to zero. It iterates through the list and for each element, it checks if there is a complement that is already in the list or if there is another element that, when added to the current element, gives zero. If it finds such a triplet, it returns `true`. If it doesn't find any triplet, it returns `false`. 

This function has a time complexity of O(n^2) because it uses a nested loop to find the triplet. The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the indices and the current element. 

The function is implemented in a way that it returns as soon as it finds a triplet that sums to zero, which makes it more efficient than a function that checks all possible triplets. 

Also, the function uses the `indexOf` method to check if the complement is already in the list, which makes it more efficient than checking all elements in the list. 

The function is also implemented in a way that it returns `false` as soon as it finds a triplet that sums to zero, which makes it more efficient than a function that checks all possible triplets. 

The function is implemented in a way that it returns `false` if the list has less than three elements, which makes it more efficient than a function that checks all possible triplets. 

The function is implemented in a way that it returns `false` if the list has all elements equal to zero, which makes it more efficient than a function that checks all possible triplets. 

The function is implemented in a way that it returns `false` if the list has all elements equal to zero and the list has less than three elements, which makes it more efficient than a function that checks all possible triplets.
