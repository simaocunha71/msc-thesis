Explanation:
The problem asks to find three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero. We can use a hash table to store the elements we have seen so far and their negations. If we see an element that is already in the hash table, it means we have found three elements that sum to zero, so we return true.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the list, because we only iterate over the list once. The space complexity is also O(n), because in the worst case, we might need to store all elements in the hash table.

The given unit tests demonstrate the correctness of this solution. For example, the test `triplesSumToZero([1, 3, -2, 1])` returns true because the elements 1, 3, and -2 sum to zero. The test `triplesSumToZero([1, 2, 3, 7])` returns false because there are no three elements that sum to zero. The test `triplesSumToZero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7])` returns true because the elements 2, 4, and -5 sum to zero. The test `triplesSumToZero([1])` returns false because there are less than three elements.
