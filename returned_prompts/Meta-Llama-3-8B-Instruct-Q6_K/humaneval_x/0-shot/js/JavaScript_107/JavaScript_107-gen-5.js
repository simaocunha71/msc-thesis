Explanation:

This problem requires us to count the number of even and odd integer palindromes within the range (1, n), inclusive. To solve this problem, we can use a loop to iterate over the range and check each number for palindrome. If the number is a palindrome and even, increment the even count; if the number is a palindrome and odd, increment the odd count.

In the code, we initialize two counters, evenCount and oddCount, to store the count of even and odd palindromes, respectively. Then, we loop over the range (1, n) and for each number, we convert it to a string, then check if it is a palindrome by comparing the first and last characters, and so on. If the number is a palindrome and even, we increment the evenCount; if the number is a palindrome and odd, we increment the oddCount.

Finally, we return the list containing the evenCount and oddCount. This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the input number, and a space complexity of O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the counters and strings.
