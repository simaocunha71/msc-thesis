```
const evenOddPalindrome = (n) => {
  let evenCount = 0;
  let oddCount = 0;
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    const str = i.toString();
    if (str === str.split("").reverse().join("")) {
      if (parseInt(str) % 2 === 0) evenCount++;
      else oddCount++;
    }
  }
  return [evenCount, oddCount];
};
```


Explanation:

1. Initialize two counters: `evenCount` and `oddCount` to 0.
2. Iterate through the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
3. For each number, convert it to a string and check if it's a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse.
4. If the number is a palindrome, check if it's even or odd using the modulo operator (`% 2 === 0` for even, `!% 2 === 0` for odd).
5. If the number is even, increment `evenCount`. If it's odd, increment `oddCount`.
6. Return a list containing `evenCount` and `oddCount`.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) because it iterates through the range from 1 to `n`. The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the counters and the temporary string.
