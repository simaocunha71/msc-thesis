Explanation:
This problem requires you to count the number of even and odd integer palindromes within the given range. You can use a loop to iterate over the range, convert each number to a string, and check if it's a palindrome. If it is, you need to check if it's even or odd and increment the corresponding counter. Finally, return the counts of even and odd palindromes.

In the code above, we initialize two counters, `even` and `odd`, to 0. Then we loop over the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive). For each number, we convert it to a string and check if it's a palindrome by comparing the characters from both ends. If it's a palindrome, we check if it's even or odd and increment the corresponding counter. At the end, we return a list containing the counts of even and odd palindromes.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) because we're iterating over the range once, and a space complexity of O(1) because we're only using a constant amount of space to store the counters.
