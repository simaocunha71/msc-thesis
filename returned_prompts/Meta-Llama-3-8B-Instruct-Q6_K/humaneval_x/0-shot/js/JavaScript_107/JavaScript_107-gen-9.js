```
const evenOddPalindrome = (n) => {
  let even = 0, odd = 0;
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    let str = i.toString();
    let rev = str.split('').reverse().join('');
    if (i === parseInt(rev)) {
      if (i % 2 === 0) even++;
      else odd++;
    }
  }
  return [even, odd];
};
```


Explanation:
The problem is asking to count the number of even and odd integer palindromes within the range (1, n), inclusive. 

To solve this, we can iterate through each number from 1 to n, convert it to a string, reverse the string, and check if it is equal to the original string. If it is, then the number is a palindrome. 

We also need to check if the palindrome is even or odd. If the number is even, we increment the even count; if it is odd, we increment the odd count.

Finally, we return a list containing the even and odd counts.

The time complexity is O(n) because we are iterating through each number from 1 to n. The space complexity is O(1) because we are using a constant amount of space to store the counts and strings.
