You can use a simple for loop and check if the difference between any two adjacent elements is less than the threshold. Here is the Python solution:

```Python
def hasCloseElements(numbers, threshold):
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[i-1]) < threshold:
            return True
    return False
```

And here is the equivalent JavaScript solution:

```JavaScript
const hasCloseElements = (numbers, threshold) => {
    for (let i = 1; i < numbers.length; i++) {
        if (Math.abs(numbers[i] - numbers[i-1]) < threshold) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
};
```

In this solution, we iterate over the list of numbers starting from the second element (at index 1), and for each element, we check if the difference with the previous element is less than the threshold. If we find such a pair, we return `true`. If we go through the entire list without finding such a pair, we return `false`.
