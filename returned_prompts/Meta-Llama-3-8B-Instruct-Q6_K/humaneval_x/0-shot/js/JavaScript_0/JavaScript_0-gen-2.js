```javascript
const hasCloseElements = (numbers, threshold) => {
  for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    for (let j = i + 1; j < numbers.length; j++) {
      if (Math.abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold) {
        return true;
      }
    }
  }
  return false;
};
```
This function iterates through the list of numbers and checks if any two numbers are closer to each other than the given threshold. If it finds such a pair, it immediately returns `true`. If it checks all pairs and doesn't find any, it returns `false`. The `Math.abs` function is used to calculate the absolute difference between two numbers.

Note: The time complexity of this function is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input list. This is because it checks all pairs of numbers. If the list is very large, this function may be slow. In such cases, you could consider using a more efficient algorithm, such as sorting the list and then iterating through it to find pairs that are closer than the threshold. This would have a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting. However, this would also increase the space complexity because it would require extra space to store the sorted list. The choice of algorithm depends on the specific requirements of your use case.
