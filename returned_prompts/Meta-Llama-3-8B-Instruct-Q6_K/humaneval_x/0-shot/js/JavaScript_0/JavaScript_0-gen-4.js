Here is a possible solution:
```
const hasCloseElements = (numbers, threshold) => {
  for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    for (let j = i + 1; j < numbers.length; j++) {
      if (Math.abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) <= threshold) {
        return true;
      }
    }
  }
  return false;
};
```
This function iterates over the list of numbers and checks if any two numbers are closer to each other than the given threshold. If it finds such a pair, it immediately returns `true`. If it doesn't find any such pair after checking all numbers, it returns `false`.

Note that this function has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the input list, because it uses nested loops to check all pairs of numbers. This may not be efficient for very large lists. If you need a more efficient solution, you could consider using a different algorithm or data structure. For example, you could sort the list of numbers and then iterate over it to find consecutive numbers that are closer than the threshold. This would have a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting.
