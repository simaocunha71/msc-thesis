```
  if (a > b) {
    [a, b] = [b, a];
  }

  const result = [];

  for (let i = a; i <= b; i++) {
    let isEven = false;
    let numStr = i.toString();

    for (let j = 0; j < numStr.length; j++) {
      if (+numStr[j] % 2 === 0) {
        isEven = true;
        break;
      }
    }

    if (isEven) {
      result.push(i);
    }
  }

  return result;
}
```


Note: This solution uses a single loop to iterate over the range from a to b, and another loop to check if the digits of each number are even. The result is an array of even numbers between a and b. If a is greater than b, the function swaps them to ensure that a is less than or equal to b. This is done to simplify the implementation and make it more efficient. The function returns an empty array if no even numbers are found in the range.
