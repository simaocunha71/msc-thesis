The given problem is asking to find the words in a sentence whose lengths are prime numbers. We can solve this problem by first splitting the sentence into words and then checking the length of each word. If the length of a word is a prime number, we add it to our result. Finally, we join the result words into a single string and return it.

We can define a helper function `isPrime` to check if a number is prime or not. This function checks if the number is less than or equal to 1, if it is, then it is not a prime number. Then it checks if the number is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of the number. If it is, then it is not a prime number. If the number is not divisible by any of these numbers, then it is a prime number.

Here is the JavaScript code that solves the problem:

```javascript
const wordsInSentence = (sentence) => {
  const words = sentence.split(' ');
  const result = [];
  for (const word of words) {
    if (isPrime(word.length)) {
      result.push(word);
    }
  }
  return result.join(' ');
};

const isPrime = (num) => {
  if (num <= 1) {
    return false;
  }
  for (let i = 2; i * i <= num; i++) {
    if (num % i === 0) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
};
```

In this code, we first split the sentence into words using the `split` method. Then we iterate over each word and check its length using the `isPrime` function. If the length is a prime number, we add the word to our result array. Finally, we join the result array into a single string using the `join` method and return it
