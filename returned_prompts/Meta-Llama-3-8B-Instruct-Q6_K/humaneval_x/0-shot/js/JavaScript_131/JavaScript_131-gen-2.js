```
let product = 1;
while (n > 0) {
  const digit = n % 10;
  if (digit % 2 !== 0) {
    product *= digit;
  }
  n = Math.floor(n / 10);
}
return product;
```


Here is an explanation of the code:

1. We initialize a variable `product` to 1, which will store the product of the odd digits.
2. We use a while loop to iterate over the digits of the input number `n`.
3. In each iteration, we extract the last digit of `n` using the modulo operator (`n % 10`).
4. We check if the digit is odd by checking if it is not divisible by 2 (`digit % 2 !== 0`). If it is odd, we multiply `product` by the digit.
5. We then divide `n` by 10 to move to the next digit.
6. We repeat steps 3-5 until `n` becomes 0.
7. Finally, we return the product of the odd digits.

For example, if the input is `235`, the loop will iterate as follows:

1. `n` is 235, `digit` is 5, `product` is 1
2. `n` is 23, `digit` is 3, `product` is 15
3. `n` is 2, `digit` is 2, no update to `product`
4. `n` is 0, loop exits

The final value of `product` is 15, which is returned as the result. If all digits were even, the product would be 0, which is also returned.
