```javascript
const triangleArea = (a, h) => (a * h) / 2;
```
Explanation:
The area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula: `Area = (base * height) / 2`. In this case, the base is `a` and the height is `h`. We simply multiply `a` and `h` and divide the result by 2 to get the area. This is implemented in the code above. When you call `triangleArea(5, 3)`, it will return `7.5`, which is the correct area of a triangle with a base of 5 and a height of 3.
