```javascript
function triangleArea(a, h) {
  return 0.5 * a * h;
}

console.log(triangleArea(5, 3)); // 7.5
```
Explanation:
The area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula `0.5 * base * height`. In this case, the base is `a` and the height is `h`. The function `triangleArea` takes two arguments `a` and `h` and returns the area of the triangle. The result of `console.log(triangleArea(5, 3))` is `7.5`, which is the area of a triangle with base 5 and height 3.
