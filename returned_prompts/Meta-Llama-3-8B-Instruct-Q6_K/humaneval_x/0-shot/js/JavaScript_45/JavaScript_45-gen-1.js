The function is designed to calculate the area of a triangle given the length of one side (`a`) and the height (`h`). The formula to calculate the area of a triangle is (base * height) / 2, where the base is the length of the side. In this case, the base is `a` and the height is `h`. The function takes these two parameters, calculates the area using the formula, and returns the result. The `console.log` statement at the end tests the function with the side length `5` and the height `3`, which should return an area of `7.5`.
