```javascript
const triangleArea = (a, h) => (a * h) / 2;
console.log(triangleArea(5, 3)); // Output: 7.5
```
Explanation: The area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula `(a * h) / 2`, where `a` is the length of the side and `h` is the height of the triangle. This function takes two arguments `a` and `h` and returns the calculated area. The `console.log` statement is used to test the function with the given values. The output will be `7.5`, which is the correct area of the triangle.
