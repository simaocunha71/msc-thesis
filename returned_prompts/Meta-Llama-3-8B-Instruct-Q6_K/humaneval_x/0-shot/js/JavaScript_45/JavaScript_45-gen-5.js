```javascript
function triangleArea(a, h) {
  return 0.5 * a * h;
}
```
Explanation:
The formula for the area of a triangle is (base Ã— height) / 2. In this case, the base is the length of the side (a), and the height is the given height (h). The function takes two arguments, a and h, and returns the calculated area. The 0.5 is multiplied with the product of a and h to get the correct area. 

Example usage: 
```javascript
console.log(triangleArea(5, 3)); // Output: 7.5
```
