The problem is asking for the count of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1.

Here is a JavaScript solution for the problem:

```javascript
const startsOneEnds = (n) => {
  let count = 0;
  let onesCount = 1; // count of ones at the end
  let firstDigitCount = 1; // count of ones at the start
  
  // count of n-digit positive integers that start with 1
  for (let i = 1; i < Math.pow(10, n - 1); i++) {
    count += Math.pow(10, n - 1);
  }
  
  // count of n-digit positive integers that end with 1
  for (let i = 1; i < Math.pow(10, n - 1); i++) {
    onesCount *= 10;
  }
  
  // count of n-digit positive integers that start with 1 and end with 1
  for (let i = 1; i < Math.pow(10, n - 2); i++) {
    firstDigitCount *= 10;
  }
  
  return count + onesCount - firstDigitCount;
};
```

This solution works by first counting the number of n-digit positive integers that start with 1. Then it counts the number of n-digit positive integers that end with 1. Finally, it subtracts the count of n-digit positive integers that start with 1 and end with 1 to avoid double counting. The result is the total count of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1.
