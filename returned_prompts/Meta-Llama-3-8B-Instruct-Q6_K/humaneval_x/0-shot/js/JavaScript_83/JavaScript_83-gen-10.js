```
let count = 0;

for (let i = 1; i < 10 ** n; i++) {
  let str = i.toString();
  if (str.startsWith('1') || str.endsWith('1')) {
    count++;
  }
}

return count;
```

Explanation:
The problem asks to find the count of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1. To solve this, we can iterate over all the possible n-digit positive integers and check if the integer starts or ends with 1.

We use a for loop to iterate over all the possible n-digit positive integers. For each integer, we convert it to a string using the toString() method and then check if the string starts or ends with '1' using the startsWith() and endsWith() methods respectively.

If the string starts or ends with '1', we increment the count. Finally, we return the count.

Note that we start the for loop from 1 and go up to 10^n - 1, because the maximum n-digit positive integer is 10^n - 1. We also use the toString() method to convert the integer to a string, because the startsWith() and endsWith() methods require a string as an argument.
