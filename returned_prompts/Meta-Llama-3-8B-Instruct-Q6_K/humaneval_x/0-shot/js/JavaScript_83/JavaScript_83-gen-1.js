This problem is asking to find the count of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1.

Here's a solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
const startsOneEnds = (n) => {
  if (n < 1) return 0;
  
  let count = 0;
  for (let i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
    count += 1 * Math.pow(10, n - 1) + i;
  }
  for (let i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
    count += 1 * Math.pow(10, n - 1) + i;
  }
  
  return count;
};
```

This function uses a for loop to iterate through all possible n-digit numbers that start with 1 and end with 1, and then adds them to the count. It also iterates through all possible n-digit numbers that start with 1 and end with any digit from 1 to 9, and then adds them to the count.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the input number. This is because the function iterates through all possible n-digit numbers that start with 1 and end with 1 or any digit from 1 to 9.

The space complexity of this function is O(1), which means the space used does not grow with the size of the input. This is because the function only uses a constant amount of space to store the count and the loop variables.
