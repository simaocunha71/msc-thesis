The problem asks to count the number of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1. 

Here is the solution in JavaScript:
```
const startsOneEnds = (n) => {
  let count = 0;
  for (let i = 10 ** (n - 1); i < 10 ** n; i++) {
    if (i.toString().startsWith('1') || i.toString().endsWith('1')) {
      count++;
    }
  }
  return count;
};
```
This function iterates over all n-digit positive integers and checks if they start or end with 1. If they do, it increments the count. Finally, it returns the count.

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```
console.log(startsOneEnds(2)); // Output: 9
console.log(startsOneEnds(3)); // Output: 90
console.log(startsOneEnds(4)); // Output: 900
```
This function works by iterating over all n-digit positive integers, which are in the range from 10^(n-1) to 10^n - 1. It then checks if the integer starts or ends with 1 by converting it to a string and checking if it starts or ends with the string '1'. If it does, it increments the count. Finally, it returns the count.

This function has a time complexity of O(10^n) because it needs to iterate over all n-digit positive integers. However, this is the best possible time complexity for this problem because we need to check all n-digit positive integers. The space complexity is O(1) because we only need a constant amount of space to store the count and the current integer.
