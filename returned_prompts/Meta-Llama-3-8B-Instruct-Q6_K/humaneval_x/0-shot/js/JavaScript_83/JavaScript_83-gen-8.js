```
let count = 0;
for (let i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
  let num = i * Math.pow(10, n - 1);
  for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    num = num % 10 === 0 ? num / 10 : num % 10 * Math.pow(10, j) + Math.floor(num / 10 ** (j + 1));
    if (num >= 1 || num % 10 === 1) {
      count++;
      break;
    }
  }
}
return count;
```

The above code works by iterating through all the possible numbers that start with 1 and then checking if they end with 1. It does this by using a for loop to generate all the possible numbers that start with 1 and then checking if they end with 1. If a number ends with 1, it increments the count. It does this for all the numbers that start with 1 and then returns the count.

However, this code is not efficient and will not work for large values of n. This is because it generates all the possible numbers that start with 1 and then checks if they end with 1. This can be optimized by only checking the last digit of the number and not generating all the possible numbers. Here is a more efficient version of the code:
```
const startsOneEnds = (n) => {
  let count = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    count += 9 * Math.pow(10, i);
  }
  count += 1 * Math.pow(10, n - 1);
  return count;
};
```
This code works by calculating the number of numbers that start with 1 and end with 1, and then adding the number of numbers that start with 1 but do not end with 1. The number of numbers that start with 1 and end with 1 is calculated by multiplying the number of possible digits (9) by the number of digits before the last digit (n-1). The number of numbers that start with 1 but do not end with 1 is calculated by multiplying the number of possible digits (9) by the number of digits before the last digit (n-1) and then adding the number of possible digits (1) for the last digit. This code is more efficient because it only calculates the number
