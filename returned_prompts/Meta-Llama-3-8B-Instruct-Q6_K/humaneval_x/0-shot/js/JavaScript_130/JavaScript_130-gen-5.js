Here is the JavaScript solution for the problem:

```javascript
const tri = (n) => {
  let result = [3];
  if (n > 0) {
    result.push(1);
    if (n > 1) {
      result.push(3);
      if (n > 2) {
        for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
          if (i % 2 === 0) {
            result.push(1 + i / 2);
          } else {
            result.push(result[i - 1] + result[i - 2] + result[i - 3]);
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  return result;
};
```

In this solution, we first initialize the result array with the first element of the Tribonacci sequence, which is 3. Then, we check if n is greater than 0. If it is, we add 1 and 3 to the result array. If n is greater than 2, we use a for loop to calculate the next elements of the sequence. If the current index is even, we calculate the next element as 1 + i / 2. If the current index is odd, we calculate the next element as the sum of the last three elements of the sequence. Finally, we return the result array.
