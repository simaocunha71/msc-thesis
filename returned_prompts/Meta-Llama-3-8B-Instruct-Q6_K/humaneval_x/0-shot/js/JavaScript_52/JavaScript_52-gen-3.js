```
const belowThreshold = (l, t) => l.every(x => x < t);
```


Explanation:

The problem asks to create a function `belowThreshold` that takes a list `l` and a threshold `t` as input, and returns `true` if all numbers in the list are below the threshold, and `false` otherwise.

The solution uses the built-in JavaScript method `every()`, which returns `true` if all elements in the list pass the test implemented by the provided function. In this case, the function is `x => x < t`, which checks if each element `x` in the list is less than the threshold `t`.

If all elements in the list are below the threshold, `every()` returns `true`, and the function `belowThreshold` returns `true`. If any element is not below the threshold, `every()` returns `false`, and the function `belowThreshold` returns `false`.

The code is concise and efficient, as it uses a built-in method to perform the iteration and comparison, rather than writing a custom loop. This makes it easy to read and maintain.
