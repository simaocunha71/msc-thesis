  This problem is a variation of the shortest path problem. We can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path. However, since we are looking for a path of length k, we need to modify the algorithm to keep track of the path length and the values visited.

  Here is a possible solution:
```
  function minPath(grid, k) {
    let n = grid.length;
    let res = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        let visited = new Set();
        let path = [];
        dfs(grid, i, j, k, visited, path, res);
      }
    }
    return res[0];
  }

  function dfs(grid, i, j, k, visited, path, res) {
    if (k === 0) {
      res[0] = path;
      return;
    }
    visited.add(grid[i][j]);
    path.push(grid[i][j]);
    for (let x = -1; x <= 1; x++) {
      for (let y = -1; y <= 1; y++) {
        if (x === 0 && y === 0) continue;
        let ni = i + x;
        let nj = j + y;
        if (ni >= 0 && ni < grid.length && nj >= 0 && nj < grid.length && !visited.has(grid[ni][nj])) {
          dfs(grid, ni, nj, k - 1, visited, path, res);
        }
      }
    }
    path.pop();
    visited.delete(grid[i][j]);
  }
```
This solution uses a depth-first search (DFS) to explore the grid. It keeps track of the visited cells and the current path. When it finds a path of length k, it updates the result.

The time complexity of this solution is O(N^2 \* k), where N is the size of the grid. This is because we are exploring the grid with a depth of k. The space complexity is O(N^2), which is the maximum size of the visited set and the path array.

Note that this solution assumes that the grid is a square grid (i.e., N = grid.length). If the grid is not a square grid, you will need to modify the solution accordingly. Also, this solution assumes that the grid does not contain any duplicate values. If the grid
