The problem is asking you to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. The path can start from any cell, and in each step, you can move to any of the neighbor cells. The path should visit exactly k cells, and the values on the cells should be in lexicographically less order.

Here is a Python solution for this problem:

```
def minPath(grid, k):
    n = len(grid)
    res = []
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            res.append((grid[i][j], i, j))
    res.sort()
    path = []
    for i in range(k):
        for j in range(n):
            for x in range(n):
                if abs(j - res[i][1]) + abs(x - res[i][2]) == 1:
                    path.append(res[i][0])
                    res.pop(i)
                    break
    return path
```

In this solution, we first convert the grid into a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the value of the cell and its coordinates. We then sort this list. Then, for each step in the path, we find the cell that is closest to the current cell and has not been visited before. We add the value of this cell to the path and remove it from the list. We repeat this process until we have visited k cells.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^3), where n is the size of the grid. This is because we are iterating over the grid three times: once to convert the grid into a list of tuples, once to sort the list, and once to find the minimum path.

The space complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the size of the grid. This is because we are storing the list of tuples and the path in memory. The list of tuples has a size of O(n^2), and the path has a size of O(k). Since k is at most n^2, the total space complexity is O(n^2).
