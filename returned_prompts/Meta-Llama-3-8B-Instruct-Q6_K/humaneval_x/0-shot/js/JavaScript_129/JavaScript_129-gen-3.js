The problem can be solved by using a depth-first search (DFS) approach. The idea is to start from each cell and explore all possible paths of length k. We keep track of the minimum path seen so far and return it at the end.

Here is the implementation in JavaScript:
```javascript
const minPath = (grid, k) => {
  const N = grid.length;
  const res = [];
  const visited = Array(N * N).fill(false);

  for (let i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < N; j++) {
      if (!visited[i * N + j]) {
        dfs(grid, i, j, k, visited, res);
      }
    }
  }

  return res;
};

const dfs = (grid, i, j, k, visited, res) => {
  const N = grid.length;
  if (k === 0) {
    res.push(grid[i][j]);
    return;
  }

  visited[i * N + j] = true;
  for (let di = -1; di <= 1; di++) {
    for (let dj = -1; dj <= 1; dj++) {
      if (Math.abs(di) + Math.abs(dj) === 1 && i + di >= 0 && i + di < N && j + dj >= 0 && j + dj < N) {
        if (!visited[(i + di) * N + j + dj]) {
          dfs(grid, i + di, j + dj, k - 1, visited, res);
        }
      }
    }
  }
  visited[i * N + j] = false;
};
```
The function `minPath` takes the grid and the value of k as input and returns the minimum path of length k. The function `dfs` is a helper function that performs the DFS traversal.

The DFS traversal starts from each cell and explores all possible paths of length k. We keep track of the minimum path seen so far by updating the result array `res`. The function `dfs` returns the minimum path of length k starting from the current cell.

The time complexity of the solution is O(N^3), where N is the size of the grid. This is because we are performing DFS traversal from each cell and exploring all possible paths of length k. The space complexity is O(N^2), which is used to store the visited array and
