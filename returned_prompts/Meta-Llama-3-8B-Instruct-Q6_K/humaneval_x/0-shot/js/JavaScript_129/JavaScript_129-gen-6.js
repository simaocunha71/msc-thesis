We will use a DFS algorithm to solve this problem. We will start from each cell and explore all possible paths of length k. For each path, we will store the values of the cells in the path in an array. We will then sort these arrays and find the lexicographically smallest one. We will return this array as the result.

Here is the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
const minPath = (grid, k) => {
    let minPath = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < grid[0].length; j++) {
            let path = [];
            dfs(grid, i, j, k, path, minPath);
        }
    }
    return minPath;
};

function dfs(grid, i, j, k, path, minPath) {
    if (k === 0) {
        if (path.length < minPath.length || (path.length === minPath.length && path < minPath)) {
            minPath = path;
        }
        return;
    }
    for (let ni = i - 1; ni <= i + 1; ni++) {
        for (let nj = j - 1; nj <= j + 1; nj++) {
            if (ni >= 0 && ni < grid.length && nj >= 0 && nj < grid[0].length && ni !== i || nj !== j) {
                path.push(grid[ni][nj]);
                dfs(grid, ni, nj, k - 1, path, minPath);
                path.pop();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(N^3), where N is the number of rows (or columns) in the grid. This is because for each cell in the grid, we are performing a DFS of depth k, which takes O(N^2) time. The space complexity is O(N^2) for storing the path and the minimum path.

Note that this solution assumes that the input grid is valid, i.e., it has at least 2 rows and 2 columns, and each cell contains a value between 1 and N^2 inclusive, where N is the number of rows (or columns) in the grid. It also assumes that k is a positive integer less than or equal to N^2. If these assumptions are not valid, the solution may not work correctly.
