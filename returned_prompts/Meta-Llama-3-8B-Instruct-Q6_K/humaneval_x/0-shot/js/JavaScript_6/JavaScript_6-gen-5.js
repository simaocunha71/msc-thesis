Here is the solution for the problem:

```javascript
const parseNestedParens = (paren_string) => {
  const groups = paren_string.split(' ');
  const result = [];

  for (const group of groups) {
    let maxDepth = 0;
    let currentDepth = 0;

    for (const char of group) {
      if (char === '(') {
        currentDepth++;
        maxDepth = Math.max(maxDepth, currentDepth);
      } else if (char === ')') {
        currentDepth--;
      }
    }

    result.push(maxDepth);
  }

  return result;
};

console.log(parseNestedParens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())'));
// Output: [2, 3, 1, 3]
```

In this solution, we first split the input string into groups using the `split` method. Then, for each group, we iterate over the characters to count the maximum depth of nesting. We use two variables, `currentDepth` and `maxDepth`, to keep track of the current and maximum depth of nesting, respectively. When we encounter an opening parenthesis, we increment `currentDepth` and update `maxDepth` if necessary. When we encounter a closing parenthesis, we decrement `currentDepth`. Finally, we add the maximum depth of nesting for each group to the result array.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the total number of characters in the input string, since we iterate over each character once. The space complexity is O(1), since we use a constant amount of space to store the result and variables.  */



This is the output of the code:

```
[ 2, 3, 1, 3 ]
```



This output matches the expected result: the deepest level of nesting for each group in the input string. The first group `(()())` has a maximum depth of 2, the second group `((()))` has a maximum depth of 3, the third group `()` has a maximum depth of 1, and the fourth group `((())()())` has a maximum depth of 3.  */



The code works by iterating over each group in the input string and counting the maximum depth of nesting. It uses two variables, `currentDepth` and `maxDepth`, to keep track of the current and maximum depth of nesting, respectively. When it encounters an opening parenthesis, it increments `currentDepth` and updates `maxDepth
