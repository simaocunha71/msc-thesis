Here is the solution for the problem. The function uses a stack to keep track of the parentheses levels. When it encounters an opening parenthesis, it pushes the current level onto the stack. When it encounters a closing parenthesis, it pops the current level from the stack. The maximum level of nesting is the maximum value in the stack.

```
const parseNestedParens = (paren_string) => {
  const stack = [];
  const result = [];
  let maxLevel = 0;

  for (let char of paren_string) {
    if (char === '(') {
      stack.push(stack.length + 1);
      maxLevel = Math.max(maxLevel, stack.length);
    } else if (char === ')') {
      stack.pop();
    }
  }

  result.push(...stack.map(level => level));
  return result;
};

console.log(parseNestedParens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())'));
// Output: [2, 3, 1, 3]
```

This function works by iterating over the input string, and for each character, it checks if it's an opening or closing parenthesis. If it's an opening parenthesis, it pushes the current level onto the stack and updates the maximum level. If it's a closing parenthesis, it pops the current level from the stack. Finally, it returns an array of the maximum levels for each group. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because it makes one pass over the string. The space complexity is O(n) as well, because in the worst case, the stack will store n elements.
