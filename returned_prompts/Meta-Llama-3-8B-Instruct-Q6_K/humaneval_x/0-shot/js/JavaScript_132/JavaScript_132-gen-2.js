Here is a JavaScript solution for the problem:

```javascript
const isNested = (string) => {
  let stack = [];
  for (let char of string) {
    if (char === '[') {
      stack.push(char);
    } else if (char === ']') {
      if (stack.length === 0) return false;
      stack.pop();
    }
  }
  return stack.length > 0;
};
```

The function `isNested` takes a string as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the string contains a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket in the subsequence is nested.

The function uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. For each character in the string, if the character is an opening bracket, it is pushed onto the stack. If the character is a closing bracket, the function checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means there is no matching opening bracket, so the function returns `false`. If the stack is not empty, the function pops the opening bracket from the stack.

After processing all characters in the string, the function checks if the stack is not empty. If the stack is not empty, it means there are unmatched opening brackets, so the function returns `true`. If the stack is empty, the function returns `false`.

For example, the string '[[]]' has a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket is nested, so the function returns `true`. The string '[]]]]]]][[[[[]' does not have a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket is nested, so the function returns `false`. The string '[][]' does not have a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket is nested, so the function returns `false`. The string '[]' does not have a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket is nested, so the function returns `false`. The string '[[][]]' has a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket is nested, so the function returns `true`. The string '[[]][[' has a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket is nested, so the function returns `true`.
