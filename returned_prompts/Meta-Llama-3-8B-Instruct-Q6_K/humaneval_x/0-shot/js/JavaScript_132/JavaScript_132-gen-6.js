```
function isNested(str) {
  const stack = [];
  for (let char of str) {
    if (char === '[') {
      stack.push(char);
    } else if (char === ']') {
      if (stack.length === 0) return false;
      stack.pop();
    }
  }
  return stack.length > 0;
}
```



Explanation:
The problem requires us to write a function that takes a string of square brackets as input and returns true if there is a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket is nested. A bracket is considered nested if it is inside another bracket.

We can solve this problem by using a stack data structure. We iterate over each character in the string. If the character is a '[', we push it onto the stack. If the character is a ']', we check if the stack is empty. If it is, we return false because there is no matching opening bracket for the closing bracket. If the stack is not empty, we pop the opening bracket from the stack.

After iterating over the entire string, we check if the stack is not empty. If it is, we return true because there is at least one opening bracket that has not been matched with a closing bracket, which means there is a nested bracket.

Here is the JavaScript code that implements this solution:

```
function isNested(str) {
  const stack = [];
  for (let char of str) {
    if (char === '[') {
      stack.push(char);
    } else if (char === ']') {
      if (stack.length === 0) return false;
      stack.pop();
    }
  }
  return stack.length > 0;
}
```



Let's test the function with some examples:

```
console.log(isNested('[[]]')); // true
console.log(isNested('[]]]]]]][[[[[]')); // false
console.log(isNested('[][]')); // false
console.log(isNested('[]')); // false
console.log(isNested('[[][]]')); // true
console.log(isNested('[[]][[')); // true
```

The output is as expected, and the function correctly identifies the strings with nested brackets.
