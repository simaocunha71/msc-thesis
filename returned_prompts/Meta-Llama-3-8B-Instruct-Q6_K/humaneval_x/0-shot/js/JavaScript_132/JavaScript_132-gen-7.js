Here is the solution to the problem:

```javascript
const isNested = (string) => {
  let count = 0;
  for (let char of string) {
    if (char === '[') {
      count++;
    } else if (char === ']') {
      if (count > 0) {
        count--;
      } else {
        return false;
      }
    }
  }
  return count > 0;
};
```

Explanation:

The function `isNested` iterates over the input string and keeps track of the count of open brackets (`'['`) using a variable `count`. When it encounters a closed bracket (`']'`), it decrements the count. If the count becomes zero, it means that all open brackets have been closed, and the function returns `false`. If the function finishes iterating over the string and the count is still greater than zero, it means that there are unmatched open brackets, and the function returns `true`. If the count is zero at the end, it means that all brackets are matched, and the function returns `false`. This solution works because it ensures that there is at least one bracket in the subsequence that is nested.
