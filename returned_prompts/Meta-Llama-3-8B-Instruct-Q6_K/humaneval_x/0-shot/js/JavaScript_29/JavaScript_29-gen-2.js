```
const filterByPrefix = (strings, prefix) => strings.filter(str => str.startsWith(prefix));
```


Explanation:
The problem is asking to create a function called `filterByPrefix` that takes two parameters: `strings` (a list of strings) and `prefix` (a string). The function should return a new list containing only the strings from the original list that start with the given prefix.

The solution uses the built-in `filter` method of the Array object, which creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. In this case, the function checks if a string starts with the given prefix using the `startsWith` method, which returns a boolean value indicating whether the string starts with the specified prefix.

Here's the breakdown:

1. `strings.filter(str => ...)` filters the `strings` array and returns a new array containing only the strings that satisfy the condition.
2. `str => str.startsWith(prefix)` is the condition that is checked for each string in the `strings` array. It uses the `startsWith` method to check if the string starts with the given `prefix`. The `startsWith` method returns a boolean value (`true` if the string starts with the prefix, and `false` otherwise).
3. The `filter` method returns a new array containing only the strings that satisfy the condition (i.e., the strings that start with the given prefix).

The resulting array is then returned by the `filterByPrefix` function.
