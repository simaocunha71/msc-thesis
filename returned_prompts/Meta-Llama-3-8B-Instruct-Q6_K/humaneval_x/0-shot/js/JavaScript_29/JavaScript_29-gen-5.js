```javascript
const filterByPrefix = (strings, prefix) => strings.filter(s => s.startsWith(prefix));
```


Explanation:
The problem is asking to write a function `filterByPrefix` that takes two parameters: an array of strings `strings` and a prefix `prefix`. The function should return a new array containing only the strings from the input array that start with the given prefix.

We can solve this problem using the `filter` method provided by JavaScript arrays. The `filter` method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.

In our case, the function is `s => s.startsWith(prefix)`, which checks if a string `s` starts with the given `prefix` using the `startsWith` method. If the string starts with the prefix, the function returns `true`, which allows the string to be included in the new array. If the string does not start with the prefix, the function returns `false`, which excludes the string from the new array.

The `filter` method applies this function to each element in the input array `strings` and returns a new array containing only the strings that pass the test. This is exactly what we need to solve the problem.
