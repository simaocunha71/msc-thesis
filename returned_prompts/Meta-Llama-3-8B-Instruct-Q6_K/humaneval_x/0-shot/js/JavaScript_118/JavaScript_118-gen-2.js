Explanation:

The function `getClosestVowel` takes a word as an argument and returns the closest vowel that stands between two consonants from the right side of the word.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize an empty string `result` to store the closest vowel.
2. Initialize a boolean flag `found` to `false` to track if a vowel has been found.
3. Iterate over the word from the right side (i.e., from the end) to the left side (i.e., from the beginning).
4. Inside the loop, check if the current character is a vowel using the `includes` method and the array `['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']`. The `toLowerCase` method is used to make the comparison case-insensitive.
5. If a vowel is found and `found` is `false`, set `result` to the current vowel and set `found` to `true`. This ensures that the first vowel found is stored in `result`.
6. If a vowel is found and `found` is `true`, return the current vowel as the closest vowel.
7. If no vowel is found after iterating over the entire word, return an empty string.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input word, because we iterate over the word once. The space complexity is O(1), because we only use a constant amount of space to store the result and the flag.
