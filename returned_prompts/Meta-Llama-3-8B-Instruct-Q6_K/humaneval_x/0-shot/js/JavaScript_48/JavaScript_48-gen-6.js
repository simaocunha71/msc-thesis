The function isPalindrome checks if a given string is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).

The function first removes all non-alphanumeric characters from the string using a regular expression and converts the string to lowercase. This is done to handle strings with spaces, punctuation, or different capitalization.

Then, it splits the cleaned string into an array of individual characters, reverses the array, and joins it back into a string. If the resulting string is the same as the original cleaned string, the function returns `true`, indicating that the original string is a palindrome. Otherwise,
