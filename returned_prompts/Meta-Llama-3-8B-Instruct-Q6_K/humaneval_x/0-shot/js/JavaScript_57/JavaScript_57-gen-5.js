```javascript
function monotonic(l) {
    let increasing = true;
    let decreasing = true;

    for (let i = 1; i < l.length; i++) {
        if (l[i] > l[i - 1]) {
            decreasing = false;
        }
        if (l[i] < l[i - 1]) {
            increasing = false;
        }
    }

    return increasing || decreasing;
}
```


Explanation:
This function checks if the list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing. It initializes two boolean variables, `increasing` and `decreasing`, to `true`. Then, it iterates through the list, checking if each element is greater than or less than the previous one. If it finds an element that is greater than the previous one, it sets `decreasing` to `false`. If it finds an element that is less than the previous one, it sets `increasing` to `false`. Finally, it returns `increasing || decreasing`, which is `true` if the list is either monotonically increasing or decreasing. If the list is neither increasing nor decreasing, it returns `false`.
