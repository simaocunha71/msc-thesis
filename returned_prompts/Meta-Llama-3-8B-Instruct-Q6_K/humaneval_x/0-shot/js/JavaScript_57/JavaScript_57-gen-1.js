```
const monotonic = (l) => {
  return l.every((x, i, a) => i === 0 || (i > 0 && (x >= a[i - 1] && a[i - 1] !== a[i]) || x <= a[i - 1]));
};
```



Explanation:
The function `monotonic` takes a list `l` as an argument and returns a boolean value indicating whether the list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing.

The function uses the `every` method, which returns `true` if all elements in the list satisfy the provided condition. The condition is defined as follows:

- If the current element is the first element in the list (`i === 0`), the function returns `true`.
- If the current element is not the first element (`i > 0`), the function checks if the current element is either greater than or equal to the previous element (`x >= a[i - 1]`) and the previous element is not the same as the current element (`a[i - 1] !== a[i]`) or if the current element is less than or equal to the previous element (`x <= a[i - 1]`).

If the condition is satisfied for all elements in the list, the function returns `true`, indicating that the list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing. Otherwise, it returns `false`.
