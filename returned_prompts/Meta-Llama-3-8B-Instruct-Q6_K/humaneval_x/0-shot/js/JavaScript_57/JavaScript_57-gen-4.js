```javascript
const monotonic = (l) => {
  return l.every((x, i, arr) => {
    if (i === 0) return true;
    return x <= arr[i - 1] || x >= arr[i - 1];
  });
};
```
Explanation:
The problem asks to check if the list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing. To solve this, we can use the `every` method which returns `true` if all elements in the list pass the test implemented by the provided function. We iterate over the list and for each element, we check if it is less than or equal to the previous element (for increasing sequence) or greater than or equal to the previous element (for decreasing sequence). If the condition is not met, we return `false`. If all elements pass the test, we return `true`. 

The base case for our recursion is when `i` is 0, in which case we return `true` as there is no previous element to compare with. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the list, as we are iterating over the list once. The space complexity is O(1), as we are using a constant amount of space to store the variables.
