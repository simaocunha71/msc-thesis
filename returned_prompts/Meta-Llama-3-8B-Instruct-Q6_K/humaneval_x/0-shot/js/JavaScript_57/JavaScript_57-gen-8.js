```javascript
const monotonic = (l) => {
  return l.every((a, i) => {
    if (i === 0) return true;
    return a >= l[i - 1] || a <= l[i - 1];
  });
};
```

Explanation:
The function `monotonic` takes an array `l` as an argument. It checks if all elements in the array are either monotonically increasing (i.e., each element is greater than or equal to the previous one) or decreasing (i.e., each element is less than or equal to the previous one). The function uses the `every` method to iterate over the array. For each element, it checks if the element is greater than or equal to the previous one (using the `||` operator to cover both increasing and decreasing cases). If the element does not satisfy this condition, the function returns `false`. If the function iterates over the entire array without finding any elements that do not satisfy the condition, it returns `true`. The initial condition `i === 0` is used to avoid comparing the first element with any previous element, as there is no previous element for the first element. This ensures that the function correctly handles arrays of length 1 or less. The `every` method returns `true` if all elements in the array satisfy the provided condition, and `false` otherwise. Therefore, the function returns `true` if the array is monotonically increasing or decreasing, and `false` otherwise.
