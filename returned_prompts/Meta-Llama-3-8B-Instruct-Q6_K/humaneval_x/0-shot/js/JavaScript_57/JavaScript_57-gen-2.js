```javascript
const monotonic = (l) => {
  return l.every((x, i, a) => {
    return i === 0 || (x >= a[i - 1] && (i === l.length - 1 || x <= a[i + 1]));
  });
};
```


Explanation:
The function `monotonic` checks if the input list `l` is monotonically increasing or decreasing. It uses the `every` method, which returns `true` if all elements in the list pass the test implemented by the provided function.

The provided function checks if each element `x` in the list is either:
1. The first element in the list (`i === 0`), in which case there's no condition to check.
2. Greater than or equal to the previous element (`x >= a[i - 1]`), indicating a monotonically increasing sequence.
3. Less than or equal to the next element (`x <= a[i + 1]`) if `i` is not the last element in the list (`i !== l.length - 1`), indicating a monotonically decreasing sequence.

If any element fails to meet these conditions, the `every` method returns `false`. If all elements pass the test, the method returns `true`, indicating that the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing.
