```javascript
const monotonic = (l) => {
  return l.every((x, i, a) => x <= a[i + 1] || x >= a[i + 1]);
};
```

Explanation:
The function `monotonic` takes a list `l` as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing.

The function uses the `every` method to check if the list satisfies the condition for monotonicity. The condition is that for each element `x` in the list, either `x` is less than or equal to the next element in the list (`a[i + 1]`), or `x` is greater than or equal to the next element in the list (`a[i + 1]`).

If the list satisfies this condition for all elements, the function returns `true`, indicating that the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing. If the list does not satisfy this condition for any element, the function returns `false`.
