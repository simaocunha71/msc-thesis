```javascript
const monotonic = (l) => {
  return l.every((x, i) => i === 0 || (l[i-1] <= x)) ||
         l.every((x, i) => i === 0 || (l[i-1] >= x));
};
```
Explanation:
The problem is asking whether the list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing. We can achieve this by checking if the list elements are either monotonically increasing or decreasing.

We use the `every` method to check if all elements in the list satisfy the condition. The condition is that the current element is greater than or equal to the previous element (for increasing) or less than or equal to the previous element (for decreasing).

We use a logical OR (`||`) to check for both increasing and decreasing conditions. If the list is monotonically increasing, the first `every` method will return `true`. If the list is monotonically decreasing, the second `every` method will return `true`. If the list is neither increasing nor decreasing, both `every` methods will return `false`.

The `i === 0 ||` part is used to handle the case where `i` is 0, i.e., the first element in the list. In this case, we don't have a previous element to compare with, so we simply return `true` for the increasing and decreasing conditions.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the list, because we are iterating over the list once. The space complexity is O(1), because we are using a constant amount of space to store the temporary variables.
