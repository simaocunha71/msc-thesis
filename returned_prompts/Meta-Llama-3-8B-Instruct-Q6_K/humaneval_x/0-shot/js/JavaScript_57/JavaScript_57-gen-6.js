```
return l.every((v, i) => {
  if (i === 0) return true;
  return v <= l[i - 1] || v >= l[i - 1];
});
```


The above function checks if the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing by comparing each element with its previous one. If all elements are either increasing or decreasing, the function returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`. The `every` method is used to apply the comparison function to every element in the list. The comparison function returns `true` if the current element is either less than or equal to the previous one (for increasing sequence) or greater than or equal to the previous one (for decreasing sequence). If the current element does not meet the condition, the function returns `false`, and the `every` method stops iterating. If the function returns `true` for all elements, it means the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing, and the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`. This implementation is more efficient than using separate functions for increasing and decreasing sequences, as it only requires one pass through the list.
