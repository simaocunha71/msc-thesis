```javascript
const monotonic = (l) => {
  return l.every((x, i, a) => {
    if (i === 0) return true;
    return (x >= a[i - 1] && a.slice(0, i).every((v) => v <= x)) ||
           (x <= a[i - 1] && a.slice(0, i).every((v) => v >= x));
  });
};
``` 

Explanation:
The function `monotonic` takes an array `l` as an argument and returns a boolean indicating whether the array's elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing.

The function uses the `every` method to iterate through the array. For each element `x` at index `i`, it checks whether `x` is greater than or equal to the previous element (`a[i - 1]`) and whether all previous elements are less than or equal to `x`. If this condition is true, it means the array is monotonically increasing.

If the condition is not true, it checks whether `x` is less than or equal to the previous element and whether all previous elements are greater than or equal to `x`. If this condition is true, it means the array is monotonically decreasing.

If neither condition is true, it returns `false`, indicating that the array is not monotonically increasing or decreasing. If the function has iterated through the entire array without finding a pair of adjacent elements that do not satisfy the conditions, it returns `true`, indicating that the array is monotonically increasing or decreasing. 

The `every` method returns `true` if all elements in the array satisfy the condition, and `false` otherwise. If the array is empty, `every` returns `true`. 

The `slice` method is used to create a new array containing all elements up to the current index `i`. This is used to check whether all previous elements satisfy the condition. 

The `return` statement at the end of the function is unnecessary, as `every` returns `false` as soon as it finds an element that does not satisfy the condition. However, I left it there for clarity. 

The function can be tested with the provided examples to verify its correctness.
