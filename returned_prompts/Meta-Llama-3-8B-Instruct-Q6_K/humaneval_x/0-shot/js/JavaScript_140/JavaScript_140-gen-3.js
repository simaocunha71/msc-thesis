```
const fixSpaces = (text) => {
  return text.replace(/\s+/g, (match) => {
    if (match.length > 1) {
      return "-";
    } else {
      return "_";
    }
  });
};
```


Explanation:
The `replace()` method is used to replace all spaces in the string with either an underscore or a hyphen, depending on whether the space is part of a sequence of more than one consecutive space or not.

The regular expression `\s+` matches one or more whitespace characters. The `g` flag at the end makes the replacement global, so that all occurrences in the string are replaced, not just the first one.

The replacement function takes the matched whitespace characters as its argument. If the length of the matched string is greater than 1, it returns a hyphen (`-`). Otherwise, it returns an underscore (`_`).

This approach ensures that single spaces are replaced with underscores, while sequences of more than one space are replaced with a hyphen.
