```
const fixSpaces = (text) => {
  return text.replace(/\s+/g, (match) => {
    if (match.length > 1) {
      return '-';
    } else {
      return '_';
    }
  });
};
```
Explanation:
The `replace()` method is used to replace all spaces in the text with either an underscore or a hyphen, depending on whether the space is part of a consecutive sequence of more than one space.

The regular expression `\s+` matches one or more whitespace characters. The `g` flag at the end makes the replacement global, so all matches are replaced, not just the first one.

The callback function passed to `replace()` is called for each match, and it returns the replacement string. If the length of the match is greater than 1, it returns a hyphen (`'-'`), otherwise, it returns an underscore (`'_'`).

This approach ensures that all spaces are replaced, and consecutive spaces are replaced with a single hyphen.
