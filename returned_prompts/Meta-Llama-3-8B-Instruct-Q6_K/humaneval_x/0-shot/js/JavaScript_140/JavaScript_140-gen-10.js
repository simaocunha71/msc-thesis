```
const fixSpaces = (text) => {
  return text.replace(/ +/g, (match) => {
    if (match.length > 2) {
      return '-';
    } else {
      return '_';
    }
  });
};
```


Explanation:
The `replace()` method is used to replace all spaces in the text with either an underscore or a hyphen, depending on the number of consecutive spaces. The regular expression `/ +/g` matches one or more spaces in the text.

The callback function passed to `replace()` checks the length of the matched spaces. If the length is more than 2, it replaces the spaces with a hyphen. Otherwise, it replaces the spaces with an underscore.

The `g` flag at the end of the regular expression is used to replace all matches in the text, not just the first one. This ensures that all consecutive spaces are replaced correctly, even if there are multiple occurrences of them in the text.
