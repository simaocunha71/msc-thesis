```python
from statistics import median

def median(l):
    return median(sorted(l))
```
Explanation:
The problem is asking for a function that returns the median of a given list of numbers. The median is the middle value in a sorted list, or the average of the two middle values if the list has an even number of elements.

The provided unit tests suggest that the list can contain any type of comparable elements, not just integers. Therefore, we can use the built-in `sorted` function to sort the list, and the `median` function from the `statistics` module to calculate the median.

Here's the solution:
```python
from statistics import median

def median(l):
    return median(sorted(l))
```
This function takes a list `l` as input, sorts it using the `sorted` function, and then returns the median of the sorted list using the `median` function from the `statistics` module. The `median` function returns the median of the list as a floating-point number, so the function returns a floating-point number as well.
