```python
from statistics import median

def median(l):
    return median(l)
```


Note: The above Python code uses the built-in `median` function from the `statistics` module to calculate the median of the list. This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the median value. If the list is empty, it raises a `StatisticsError`. The median is the middle value in the sorted list of numbers. If the list has an odd length, the median is the middle value. If the list has an even length, the median is the average of the two middle values. The `median` function handles both cases. The `statistics` module is part of the Python Standard Library, so you don't need to install any additional libraries to use it.
