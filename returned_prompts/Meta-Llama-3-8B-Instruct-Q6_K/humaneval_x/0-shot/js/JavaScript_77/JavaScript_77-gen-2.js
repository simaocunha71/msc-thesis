```
return Math.cbrt(a) % 1 === 0;
```
Explanation:

The `Math.cbrt()` function returns the cube root of the given number. If the input number is a perfect cube, the cube root will be an integer (i.e., the remainder when divided by 1 will be 0). Otherwise, the cube root will be a decimal number.

In the provided function, `Math.cbrt(a)` calculates the cube root of the input number `a`. The remainder of this value divided by 1 is then checked using the modulus operator (`%`). If the remainder is 0, it means that the cube root is an integer, and the function returns `true`, indicating that the input number is a perfect cube. Otherwise, it returns `false`. This approach ensures the correctness of the function for all valid inputs.
