Explanation:
The function `iscube` takes an integer `a` as an argument. It iterates from `1` to the cube root of `a` (inclusive), and checks if `i` cubed is equal to `a`. If it finds a match, it returns `true`. If it doesn't find a match after checking all integers up to the cube root of `a`, it returns `false`. The cube root of `a` is calculated using the `Math.pow` function with a base of `3` and an exponent of `0.5`. This is an efficient way to find the cube root of a number without actually calculating it. The loop starts from `1` because the cube of a negative integer is the same as the cube of its positive counterpart, and we only need to check positive integers. The loop also stops when `i` cubed is greater than `a`, because if `i` cubed is equal to `a`, `j` cubed will be greater than `a` for any `j` greater than `i`. This ensures that we don't miss any possible matches. The function returns `false` if no match is found after checking all integers up to the cube root of `a`. This is because if `a` is not a perfect cube, it cannot be the cube of any integer greater than its cube root. The function is efficient because it only checks a limited range of integers, and it uses the `Math.pow` function to calculate the cube of each integer, which is faster than multiplying the integer by itself three times. The function also handles negative inputs correctly, because the cube of a negative integer is the same as the cube of its positive counterpart. The function returns `true` for the input `0`, because `0` is a perfect cube (the cube of `0`). The function returns `true` for the input `1`, because `1` is a perfect cube (the cube of `1`). The function returns `true` for the input `-1`, because `-1` is a perfect cube (the cube of `-1`). The function returns `true` for the input `64`, because `64` is a perfect cube (
