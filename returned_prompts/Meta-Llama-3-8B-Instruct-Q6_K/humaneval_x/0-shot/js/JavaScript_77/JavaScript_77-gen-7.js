```
return Math.cbrt(a) % 1 === 0;
```


Explanation:
The function uses the Math.cbrt() method, which returns the cube root of a given number. The cube root of a number is the number that, when cubed (multiplied by itself three times), gives the original number.

The condition `Math.cbrt(a) % 1 === 0` checks if the cube root of the input number `a` is an integer (i.e., the remainder when divided by 1 is 0). If the cube root is an integer, then `a` is a cube of some integer number, and the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.
