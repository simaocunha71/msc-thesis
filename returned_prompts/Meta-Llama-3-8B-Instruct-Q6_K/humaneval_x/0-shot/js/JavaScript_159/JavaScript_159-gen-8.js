```
const eat = (number, need, remaining) => {
  const totalEaten = number + Math.min(need, remaining);
  const carrotsLeft = remaining - (need - totalEaten);
  return [totalEaten, carrotsLeft];
};
```


Explanation:
* We first calculate the total number of eaten carrots by adding the number of carrots already eaten to the minimum of the number of carrots needed and the remaining carrots.
* We then calculate the number of carrots left by subtracting the difference between the number of carrots needed and the total number of eaten carrots from the remaining carrots.
* Finally, we return an array containing the total number of eaten carrots and the number of carrots left.

For example, if we call `eat(5, 6, 10)`, the output would be `[11, 4]`, because we eat 5 carrots initially, then we eat the remaining 6 carrots (leaving 4 carrots), and we still need to eat 1 carrot, so we eat 1 carrot and leave 0 carrots.
