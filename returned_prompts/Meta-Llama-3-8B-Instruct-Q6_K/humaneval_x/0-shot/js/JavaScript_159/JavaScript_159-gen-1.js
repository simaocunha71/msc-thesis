```
const eat = (number, need, remaining) => {
  const totalEaten = number + Math.min(need, remaining);
  const carrotsLeft = remaining - (totalEaten - number);
  return [totalEaten, carrotsLeft];
};
```
This function takes three parameters: `number`, `need`, and `remaining`. It calculates the total number of eaten carrots by adding the `number` of carrots already eaten and the minimum of the `need` and `remaining` carrots. Then, it calculates the number of carrots left by subtracting the total eaten from the `remaining` carrots. Finally, it returns an array with the total eaten and the carrots left. If there are not enough remaining carrots, it will eat all of them and return the remaining amount as 0.
