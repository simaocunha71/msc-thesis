```
const eat = (number, need, remaining) => {
  const totalEaten = number + Math.min(need, remaining);
  const carrotsLeft = remaining - (need - totalEaten);
  return [totalEaten, carrotsLeft];
};
```
This function takes three parameters: `number` (the number of carrots you have already eaten), `need` (the number of carrots you need to eat), and `remaining` (the number of remaining carrots in stock).

It calculates the total number of carrots you will have eaten by adding the `number` you have already eaten to the minimum of `need` and `remaining`. This ensures that you won't eat more carrots than are available.

It then calculates the number of carrots left by subtracting the difference between `need` and `totalEaten` from `remaining`. This ensures that if there are not enough remaining carrots to meet your `need`, you will eat all the remaining carrots and still be hungry.

The function returns an array containing the total number of carrots you will have eaten and the number of carrots left.
