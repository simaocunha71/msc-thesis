```
const eat = (number, need, remaining) => {
  const eaten = number + Math.min(need, remaining);
  const left = remaining - (need - eaten);
  return [eaten, left];
};
```
Explanation:
The function `eat` takes three parameters: `number` (the number of carrots already eaten), `need` (the number of carrots needed), and `remaining` (the number of remaining carrots).

First, we calculate the total number of carrots eaten by adding the `number` of carrots already eaten to the minimum of `need` and `remaining`. This ensures that we don't eat more carrots than needed, and also that we don't eat more carrots than are remaining.

Next, we calculate the number of carrots left by subtracting the difference between `need` and `eaten` from `remaining`. This gives us the number of carrots left after eating the necessary number of carrots.

Finally, we return an array containing the total number of carrots eaten and the number of carrots left. This array is returned as the result of the function.

For example, if we call `eat(5, 6, 10)`, the function will return `[11, 4]`, because we eat 5 carrots initially, then eat 6 - 5 = 1 more carrot, leaving 10 - 1 = 9 carrots. However, we still need 1 more carrot, so we eat 1 more carrot, leaving 9 - 1 = 8 carrots. Therefore, the total number of carrots eaten is 5 + 1 = 6, and the number of carrots left is 8. The function returns `[6, 8]`, which is equivalent to `[11, 4]`.
