```
const eat = (number, need, remaining) => {
  let totalEaten = number + Math.min(need, remaining);
  let carrotsLeft = remaining - (totalEaten - number);
  return [totalEaten, carrotsLeft];
};
```


Explanation:
The function `eat` takes three parameters: `number` (the number of carrots already eaten), `need` (the number of carrots needed to be eaten), and `remaining` (the number of remaining carrots).

It calculates the total number of eaten carrots by adding the already eaten carrots (`number`) to the minimum of the needed carrots (`need`) and the remaining carrots (`remaining`).

It calculates the number of carrots left by subtracting the difference between the total eaten carrots and the already eaten carrots from the remaining carrots.

Finally, it returns an array containing the total eaten carrots and the number of carrots left. If there are not enough remaining carrots, it will eat all remaining carrots, but will still be hungry (i.e., the number of carrots left will be 0).
