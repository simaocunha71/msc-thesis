```
const circularShift = (x, shift) => {
  let str = x.toString();
  shift = shift % str.length;
  return str.slice(shift) + str.slice(0, shift);
};
```


Explanation:
1. We convert the integer `x` to a string using `toString()`.
2. We calculate the effective shift by taking the modulus of `shift` with the length of the string (`str.length`). This ensures that `shift` is within the range of the number of digits in the string.
3. We use the `slice()` method to extract two parts of the string: one from the `shift` index to the end of the string (`str.slice(shift)`), and another from the beginning of the string to the `shift` index (`str.slice(0, shift)`).
4. We concatenate these two parts using the `+` operator to form the result string.
5. We return the result string.

For example, if `x` is 12 and `shift` is 1, we convert `x` to the string "12". The effective shift is 1, so we extract the second character ("2") and concatenate it with the first character ("1") to get the result "21". If `shift` is 2, the effective shift is still 1, and we get the same result "21". If `shift` is 3, the effective shift is 1, and we get the result "12". If `shift` is 4, the effective shift is 0, and we get the result "12". If `shift` is 5, the effective shift is 1, and we get the result "21". And so on.
