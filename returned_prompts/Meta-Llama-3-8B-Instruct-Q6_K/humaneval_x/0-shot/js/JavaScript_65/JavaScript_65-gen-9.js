Here is the solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
const circularShift = (x, shift) => {
  let str = String(x);
  shift = shift % str.length;
  return str.slice(shift) + str.slice(0, shift);
};
```

Explanation:

1. We convert the integer `x` to a string using `String(x)`.
2. We calculate the actual shift by taking the remainder of `shift` divided by the length of the string (`str.length`). This is to handle cases where `shift` is greater than the number of digits in the number.
3. We use the `slice` method to extract two parts of the string: the part that starts at the shifted index and the part that starts at the beginning of the string. We concatenate these two parts to get the result.

For example, if `x` is `12` and `shift` is `1`, the string is `"12"` and the shifted index is `1`. We extract the part from index `1` to the end (`"2"`), and the part from the beginning to index `1` (`"1"`). The result is `"21"`.

If `x` is `12` and `shift` is `2`, the string is `"12"` and the shifted index is `2`, which is equal to the length of the string. In this case, the result is the original string, which is `"12"`. If `shift` were `3`, the result would be the reversed string, `"21"`.
