```javascript
const circularShift = (x, shift) => {
  const numStr = x.toString();
  const shiftRemainder = shift % numStr.length;
  return numStr.slice(shiftRemainder) + numStr.slice(0, shiftRemainder);
};
```


Explanation:
The problem requires shifting the digits of the given integer `x` to the right by `shift` positions. If `shift` is greater than the number of digits, the digits should be reversed instead.

To solve this problem, we first convert the integer `x` to a string `numStr`. Then, we calculate the remainder of `shift` divided by the length of `numStr` using the modulo operator (`%`). This remainder will be the actual number of positions to shift the digits.

If the remainder is 0, it means the shift is equal to the length of the string, so we return the original string.

Otherwise, we use the `slice` method to extract two parts of the string: the part that should be shifted to the end and the part that should remain at the beginning. We concatenate these two parts to get the final result.

For example, if `x` is 12 and `shift` is 1, we get `numStr = "12"`, `shiftRemainder = 1`, and the final result is `"21"`. If `x` is 12 and `shift` is 2, we get `numStr = "12"`, `shiftRemainder = 0`, and the final result is still `"12"`.

The time complexity is O(1) because we only perform a constant number of operations, and the space complexity is O(1) because we only use a constant amount of space to store the intermediate results.
