```javascript
const circularShift = (x, shift) => {
  const str = x.toString();
  shift = shift % str.length;
  return str.substring(shift) + str.substring(0, shift);
};
```


Explanation:
The function `circularShift` takes an integer `x` and an integer `shift` as input. It converts the integer to a string using the `toString()` method.

Then, it calculates the effective shift by taking the remainder of the shift when divided by the length of the string. This is because if the shift is greater than the number of digits, it's equivalent to reversing the string.

Finally, it uses the `substring()` method to split the string into two parts: the part that should be moved to the end and the part that should remain at the beginning. It concatenates these two parts to form the result string.

For example, if `x` is `12` and `shift` is `1`, the function will return `"21"` because it shifts the digits one position to the right. If `shift` is `2`, the function will return `"12"` because it's equivalent to shifting the digits two positions to the right, which is the same as not shifting them at all. If `shift` is `3`, the function will return `"21"` because it's equivalent to shifting the digits three positions to the right, which is the same as shifting them one position to the right. If `shift` is `4`, the function will return `"12"` because it's equivalent to shifting the digits four positions to the right, which is the same as not shifting them at all. And so on.
