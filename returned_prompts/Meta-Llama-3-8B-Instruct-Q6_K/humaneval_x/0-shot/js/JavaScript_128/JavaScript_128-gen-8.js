If the array is empty, return null. Initialize two variables, signProduct and sumMagnitude, to 1 and 0, respectively. Then, iterate through each number in the array. If the number is 0, return 0 because the sum of magnitudes cannot be calculated. Otherwise, update signProduct by multiplying it with the sign of the current number and update sumMagnitude by adding the absolute value of the current number. Finally, return the product of signProduct and sumMagnitude. This solution works because the product of all signs is calculated as the product of the signs of each number in the array, and the sum of magnitudes is calculated as the sum of the absolute values of each number in the array. The product of signProduct and sumMagnitude gives the desired result.
