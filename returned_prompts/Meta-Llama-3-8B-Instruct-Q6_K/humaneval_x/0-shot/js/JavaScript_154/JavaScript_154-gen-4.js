```
const cycpatternCheck = (a, b) => {
  const bLength = b.length;
  for (let i = 0; i < bLength; i++) {
    if (a.includes(b.slice(i) + b.slice(0, i))) {
      return true;
    }
  }
  return false;
};
```

Explanation:
The function `cycpatternCheck` takes two strings `a` and `b` as input. It checks if the second string `b` or any of its rotations is a substring of the first string `a`.

It iterates over each character in the second string `b` and uses the `slice` method to create a new string that is a rotation of `b`. It then uses the `includes` method to check if this rotated string is a substring of the first string `a`. If it is, the function returns `true`.

If none of the rotations of `b` are found to be a substring of `a`, the function returns `false`.

For example, when `a` is "hello" and `b` is "ell", the function returns `true` because "ell" is a substring of "hello". When `a` is "whassup" and `b` is "psus", the function returns `false` because none of the rotations of "psus" are a substring of "whassup". 

This function has a time complexity of O(n*m), where n is the length of the first string and m is the length of the second string. This is because it iterates over each character in the second string and checks if it is a substring of the first string. 

The space complexity is O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the variables and does not use any data structures that scale with the input size.
