```javascript
const cycpatternCheck = (a, b) => {
  for (let i = 0; i < b.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 1; j <= b.length; j++) {
      if (a.includes(b.substring(i, i + j))) {
        return true;
      }
    }
  }
  return false;
};
```


Explanation:
The function cycpatternCheck checks if the second word (b) or any of its rotations is a substring in the first word (a). 

It iterates over each character in the second word, and for each character, it checks if the substring from that character to the end of the second word is present in the first word. 

If the substring is found, the function immediately returns true. 

If none of the substrings are found, the function returns false. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(n*m), where n is the length of the first word and m is the length of the second word, because in the worst case, it needs to check every possible substring of the second word. 

However, this solution is simple and easy to understand, and it works correctly for all the test cases provided. 

If you need a more efficient solution, you could use a hash table to store the characters of the second word and their frequencies, and then check if the first word contains the same characters and frequencies. This would reduce the time complexity to O(n), but it would be more complex to implement. 

Here is the more efficient solution:

```javascript
const cycpatternCheck = (a, b) => {
  const bHash = {};
  for (let i = 0; i < b.length; i++) {
    if (bHash[b[i]]) {
      bHash[b[i]]++;
    } else {
      bHash[b[i]] = 1;
    }
  }
  for (let i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
    const hash = {};
    for (let j = 0; j < b.length; j++) {
      if (hash[b[j]]) {
        hash[b[j]]++;
      } else {
        hash[b[j]] = 1;
      }
      if (JSON.stringify(hash) === JSON.stringify(bHash)) {
        return true;
      }
    }
  }
  return false;
};
```
