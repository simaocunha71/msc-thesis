```
const getOddCollatz = (n) => {
  const result = [];
  let current = n;
  while (current !== 1) {
    if (current % 2 !== 0) {
      result.push(current);
    }
    if (current % 2 === 0) {
      current = Math.floor(current / 2);
    } else {
      current = current * 3 + 1;
    }
  }
  result.push(1);
  return result.sort((a, b) => a - b);
};
```


Explanation:
The function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a sorted list of odd numbers in the Collatz sequence.

The function initializes an empty array `result` to store the odd numbers. It also initializes a variable `current` to `n`.

The function then enters a while loop that continues until `current` becomes 1. In each iteration of the loop, it checks if `current` is odd or even.

If `current` is odd, it pushes it to the `result` array.

If `current` is even, it updates `current` to be half of its previous value.

If `current` is odd, it updates `current` to be 3 times its previous value plus 1.

After the loop, the function pushes 1 to the `result` array (since the sequence ends at 1) and returns the `result` array sorted in increasing order using the `sort` method.
