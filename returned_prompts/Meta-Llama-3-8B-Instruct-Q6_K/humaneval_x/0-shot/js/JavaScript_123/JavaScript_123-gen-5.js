```
const getOddCollatz = (n) => {
  const result = [];
  let current = n;

  while (current !== 1) {
    if (current % 2 !== 0) {
      result.push(current);
    }

    if (current % 2 === 0) {
      current = Math.floor(current / 2);
    } else {
      current = 3 * current + 1;
    }
  }

  result.push(1);
  return result.sort((a, b) => a - b);
};
```


Explanation:
1. Initialize an empty array `result` to store the odd numbers.
2. Set `current` to the input `n`.
3. Loop until `current` becomes 1.
4. Inside the loop, check if `current` is odd by using the modulus operator (`%`). If it's odd, push it to the `result` array.
5. Apply the Collatz sequence rules to `current`. If it's even, divide it by 2. If it's odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
6. After the loop, push 1 to the `result` array (since 1 is the final term in the Collatz sequence).
7. Sort the `result` array in ascending order using the `sort` method and return it.

Example:
```
console.log(getOddCollatz(5)); // Output: [1, 5]
```


Time complexity: O(log n) because the Collatz sequence eventually reaches 1, and the loop runs until it does.
Space complexity: O(log n) because the `result` array stores the odd numbers in the Collatz sequence.
