```
const specialFactorial = (n) => {
  if (n <= 0) {
    throw new Error('Input must be a positive integer');
  }

  let result = 1;
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    result *= i;
  }

  for (let i = n - 1; i >= 1; i--) {
    result *= specialFactorial(i);
  }

  return result;
};
```


Here is a description of the code:

1. We first check if the input `n` is less than or equal to 0. If it is, we throw an error because the Brazilian factorial is only defined for positive integers.

2. We initialize a variable `result` to 1. This will be used to store the result of the Brazilian factorial.

3. We use a for loop to calculate the factorial of `n`. This is done by multiplying `result` by each integer from 1 to `n`.

4. We use another for loop to calculate the Brazilian factorial. This is done by multiplying `result` by the factorial of each integer from `n-1` to 1.

5. Finally, we return the result of the Brazilian factorial.

This code should correctly calculate the Brazilian factorial for any positive integer input. However, it may be slow for large inputs because it uses a recursive function to calculate the factorial. A more efficient approach would be to use an iterative algorithm to calculate the factorial.
