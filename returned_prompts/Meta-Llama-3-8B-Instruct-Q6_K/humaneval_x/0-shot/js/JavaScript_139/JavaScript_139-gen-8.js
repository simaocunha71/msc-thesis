This JavaScript function calculates the Brazilian factorial of a given integer. It uses recursion to calculate the factorial of the input number, and then multiplies it by the factorial of the previous number. The function also checks if the input number is less than or equal to 0, and throws an error if it is. 

Here's an example of how to use this function:
```
console.log(specialFactorial(4)); // Output: 288
```


Note that this function uses recursion, which can be less efficient than an iterative solution for large input values. If you need to handle large input values, you may want to consider using an iterative solution instead. 

Also, this function does not handle non-integer inputs. If you need to handle non-integer inputs, you will need to add additional error checking and handling code. 

Finally, this function does not handle very large input values. If you need to handle very large input values, you will need to use a library or framework that supports arbitrary-precision arithmetic, such as the `big-integer` library. 

Here is an iterative solution:
```
const specialFactorial = (n) => {
  if (n <= 0) {
    throw new Error('Input should be a positive integer');
  }
  let result = 1;
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    result *= i * (i - 1)!;
  }
  return result;
};
```


This function uses a loop to calculate the Brazilian factorial, rather than recursion. It starts with a result of 1, and then multiplies it by the factorial of each number from 1 to the input number. The factorial of each number is calculated using the `factorial` function. The function also checks if the input number is less than or equal to 0, and throws an error if it is. 

Here's an example of how to use this function:
```
console.log(specialFactorial(4)); // Output: 288
```


This iterative solution is generally more efficient than the recursive solution, especially for large input values. However, it may be less
