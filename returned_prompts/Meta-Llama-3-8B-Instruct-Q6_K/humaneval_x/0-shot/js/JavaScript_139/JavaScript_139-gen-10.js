```javascript
const specialFactorial = (n) => {
  let result = 1;
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    let factorial = 1;
    for (let j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
      factorial *= j;
    }
    result *= factorial;
  }
  return result;
};
```


The function `specialFactorial` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the Brazilian factorial of `n`. It does this by initializing a variable `result` to 1, then iterating from 1 to `n`. For each iteration, it calculates the factorial of the current number `i` and multiplies the result by this factorial. Finally, it returns the calculated result.

The inner loop calculates the factorial of `i` by multiplying all numbers from 1 to `i`. This is done using the variable `factorial`, which is initialized to 1 and then updated in each iteration of the inner loop. The result of this inner loop is then multiplied by the `result` variable.

The outer loop iterates from 1 to `n`, and for each iteration, it calculates the Brazilian factorial by multiplying the result by the factorial of the current number `i`. This is done using the `result` variable, which is updated in each iteration of the outer loop.

The function returns the final result, which is the Brazilian factorial of the input `n`.
