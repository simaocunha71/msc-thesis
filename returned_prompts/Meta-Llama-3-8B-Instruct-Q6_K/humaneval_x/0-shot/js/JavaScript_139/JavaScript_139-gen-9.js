```javascript
const specialFactorial = (n) => {
  if (n <= 1) return 1;
  let result = 1;
  for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    result *= i * specialFactorial(i - 1);
  }
  return result;
};
```
Explanation:
The function `specialFactorial` calculates the Brazilian factorial of a given integer `n`. It uses a recursive approach to calculate the result.

If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function returns 1, since the Brazilian factorial of 0 and 1 is defined as 1.

For `n` greater than 1, the function initializes a variable `result` to 1. It then uses a for loop to iterate from 2 to `n`, and for each iteration, it multiplies `result` by the current value of `i` and the recursive call `specialFactorial(i - 1)`.

The recursive call calculates the Brazilian factorial of `i - 1`, and the multiplication by `i` is the Brazilian factorial of `i`. The result is the product of all the Brazilian factorials from `i` to 1.

The function returns the final value of `result`, which is the Brazilian factorial of `n`. This approach ensures that the calculation is done correctly, even for large values of `n`.
