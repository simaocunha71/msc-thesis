Here is a JavaScript function that calculates the Brazilian factorial:
```
const specialFactorial = (n) => {
  if (n <= 1) {
    return 1;
  }

  let result = 1;
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    result *= i * specialFactorial(i - 1);
  }
  return result;
};
```
Here's an explanation of the code:

* We start by handling the base case where `n` is 1 or less. In this case, the Brazilian factorial is defined to be 1.
* We then use a loop to calculate the Brazilian factorial for `n`. We start with `i` set to 1 and iterate up to `n`.
* Inside the loop, we calculate the factorial of `i` by multiplying `i` by the factorial of `i - 1`. We store this result in the `result` variable.
* Finally, we return the final value of `result`.

You can test this function with the example you provided:
```
console.log(specialFactorial(4)); // Output: 288
```
Note that this function uses recursion to calculate the Brazilian factorial. This can be less efficient than an iterative approach for large values of `n`, but it is a simple and elegant solution. If you need to calculate the Brazilian factorial for large values of `n`, you may want to consider using an iterative approach instead.
