```
const specialFactorial = (n) => {
  if (n <= 1) {
    return 1;
  }
  let result = 1;
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    result *= i * specialFactorial(i - 1);
  }
  return result;
};
```


This function uses recursion to calculate the Brazilian factorial. The base case is when `n` is less than or equal to 1, in which case the function returns 1. For `n` greater than 1, the function multiplies `n` by the result of the Brazilian factorial of `n-1`, and so on, until it reaches the base case.

For example, `specialFactorial(4)` would calculate the following:

1. `specialFactorial(4)` = 4 * `specialFactorial(3)`
2. `specialFactorial(3)` = 3 * `specialFactorial(2)`
3. `specialFactorial(2)` = 2 * `specialFactorial(1)`
4. `specialFactorial(1)` = 1

So the final result is 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24. However, since the problem statement asks for the result multiplied by the factorials of the previous numbers, the correct result would be 24 * 3 * 2 = 288.
