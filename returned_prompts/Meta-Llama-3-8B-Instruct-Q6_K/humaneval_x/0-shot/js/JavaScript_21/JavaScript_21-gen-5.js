```javascript
const min = Math.min(...numbers);
const max = Math.max(...numbers);
const rescaled = numbers.map((num) => (num - min) / (max - min));
return rescaled;
```
Explanation:

*   We first find the minimum and maximum values in the input list using `Math.min` and `Math.max` with the spread operator (`...`).
*   Then, we use the `map` method to apply the rescaling transformation to each number in the list.
*   For each number, we subtract the minimum value to shift the range to start from 0, and then divide by the range (maximum minus minimum) to scale the values to be between 0 and 1.
*   Finally, we return the rescaled list.
