```
const sumSquares = (lst) => {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < lst.length; i++) {
    if (i % 3 === 0) {
      sum += lst[i] ** 2;
    } else if (i % 4 === 0 && i % 3 !== 0) {
      sum += lst[i] ** 3;
    } else {
      sum += lst[i];
    }
  }
  return sum;
};
```





The code defines a function `sumSquares` that takes a list of integers as an argument. It initializes a variable `sum` to 0, which will be used to store the sum of the modified list entries.

The function then iterates over the list using a `for` loop, and for each entry, it checks the index `i` to determine whether it should be squared, cubed, or left unchanged.

If `i` is a multiple of 3 (i.e., `i % 3 === 0`), the entry is squared and added to the sum.

If `i` is a multiple of 4 but not a multiple of 3 (i.e., `i % 4 === 0 && i % 3 !== 0`), the entry is cubed and added to the sum.

In all other cases, the entry is left unchanged and added to the sum.

Finally, the function returns the sum of all modified entries.

The examples provided in the problem statement are tested against the function, and the expected outputs are verified.
