Explanation:
The function `sumSquares` takes a list of integers as input and calculates the sum of the elements in the list. 

- For each element in the list, the function checks if its index is a multiple of 3 and not a multiple of 4. If this condition is met, the function squares the element and adds it to the sum.
- If the index is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3, the function cubes the element and adds it to the sum.
- If the index is not a multiple of 3 or 4, the function simply adds the element to the sum without modifying it.
- The function returns the sum of all elements in the list.

The function uses a for loop to iterate over the list and a conditional statement to check the index of each element. The `%` operator is used to find the remainder of the division of the index by 3 and 4. The `**` operator is used to calculate the square and cube of the elements. The sum is initialized to 0 and updated in each iteration of the loop. The final sum is returned at the end of the function. 

The function works for lists of any length, including empty lists. For an empty list, the function will return 0. 

The function also works for lists with negative numbers. For example, the input `[-1,-5,2,-1,-5]` will return `-126`. 

The function is case-sensitive and will work correctly regardless of the case of the input list. For example, the input `[1,2,3]` will return `6`. 

The function is also able to handle lists with duplicate elements. For example, the input `[1,2,2,3]` will return `6`. 

The function is able to handle lists with non-integer elements. For example, the input `[1,2,3,4.5]
