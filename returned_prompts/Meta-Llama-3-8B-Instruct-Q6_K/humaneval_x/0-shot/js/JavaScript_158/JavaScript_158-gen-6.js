```
function findMax(words) {
  let max = '';
  let maxCount = 0;
  for (let word of words) {
    let uniqueChars = new Set(word).size;
    if (uniqueChars > maxCount) {
      max = word;
      maxCount = uniqueChars;
    } else if (uniqueChars === maxCount) {
      if (word < max) {
        max = word;
      }
    }
  }
  return max;
}
```


The function iterates through the list of words and checks the number of unique characters in each word. If it finds a word with more unique characters than the current maximum, it updates the maximum word. If it finds a word with the same number of unique characters as the current maximum, it checks if the new word comes before the current maximum in lexicographical order, and if so, updates the maximum word.

The function returns the word with the maximum number of unique characters, or the first word with the maximum number of unique characters if there are multiple words with the same maximum. If the input list is empty, the function returns an empty string.

This function has a time complexity of O(n*m), where n is the number of words and m is the maximum length of a word, because it iterates through each word and checks each character. It has a space complexity of O(m), because it uses a Set to keep track of unique characters. .


Example:

```
console.log(findMax(["name", "of", "string"]));  // "string"
console.log(findMax(["name", "enam", "game"])); // "enam"
console.log(findMax(["aaaaaaa", "bb", "cc"])); // "aaaaaaa"
```


This function will correctly return the word with the maximum number of unique characters, or the first word with the maximum number of unique characters if there are multiple words with the same maximum. .


Note: The function assumes that the input list contains only strings. If the input list can contain other types of elements, additional error handling may be needed. .


This solution is efficient because it only iterates through each word once, and it uses a Set to keep track of unique characters, which has a constant time complexity for lookups and insertions. .


The function is also easy to understand and maintain because it is straightforward and uses clear variable names. .


It is also worth noting that this function has a time complexity of O(n*m) because it
