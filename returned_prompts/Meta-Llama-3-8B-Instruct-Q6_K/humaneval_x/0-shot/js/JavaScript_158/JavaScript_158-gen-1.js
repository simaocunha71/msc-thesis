```
const findMax = (words) => {
  let maxUniqueChars = 0;
  let result = '';

  for (let word of words) {
    const uniqueChars = new Set(word).size;
    if (uniqueChars > maxUniqueChars) {
      maxUniqueChars = uniqueChars;
      result = word;
    }
  }

  return result;
};
```


Explanation:
The problem is asking to find the word with the maximum number of unique characters in a given list of strings. If there are multiple words with the same maximum number of unique characters, return the one that comes first in lexicographical order.

Here is the solution in JavaScript. We initialize `maxUniqueChars` to 0 and `result` to an empty string. Then we iterate over each word in the `words` array. For each word, we calculate the number of unique characters using a `Set`. If the number of unique characters is greater than `maxUniqueChars`, we update `maxUniqueChars` and set `result` to the current word. Finally, we return `result`.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n*m), where n is the number of words and m is the maximum length of a word, because we are iterating over each character in each word. The space complexity is O(m), because we are using a `Set` to store unique characters. If there are many unique characters, the space complexity could be O(m) in the worst case. However, in practice, the space complexity is usually O(1) because the number of unique characters is usually much smaller than the total number of characters.
