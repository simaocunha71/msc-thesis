Here is a JavaScript function that solves the problem:
```
const longest = (strings) => {
  if (strings.length === 0) return null;
  let longestStr = strings[0];
  for (let str of strings) {
    if (str.length > longestStr.length) {
      longestStr = str;
    }
  }
  return longestStr;
};
```
Here's an explanation of the code:

1. We first check if the input list `strings` is empty. If it is, we return `null`.
2. We initialize a variable `longestStr` to the first element of the list.
3. We then iterate over the list using a `for...of` loop.
4. For each element `str` in the list, we check if its length is greater than the length of `longestStr`. If it is, we update `longestStr` to be `str`.
5. Finally, we return the `longestStr` which is the longest string in the list.

You can test this function with the examples you provided:
```
console.log(longest([])); // null
console.log(longest(['a', 'b', 'c'])); // 'a'
console.log(longest(['a', 'bb', 'ccc'])); // 'ccc'
```
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions. ðŸ˜Š

Note: In case of multiple strings of the same length, the function returns the first one it encounters. If you want to return all strings of the same length, you would need to modify the function accordingly. Let me know if that's the case! ðŸ˜Š

Edit: I realized that I didn't handle the case where there are multiple strings of the same length. Here's an updated version of the function that returns all strings of the same length:
```
const longest = (strings) => {
  if (strings.length === 0) return null;
  let longestStr = strings[0];
  let maxLength = longestStr.length;
  let result = [];
  for (let str of strings) {
    if (str.length === maxLength) {
      result.push(str);
    } else if (str.length > maxLength) {
      maxLength = str.length;
      result = [str];
    }
  }
  return result;
};
```
This function keeps track of the maximum length and the result array. Whenever it encounters a string of the same length as the maximum length, it adds it to the
