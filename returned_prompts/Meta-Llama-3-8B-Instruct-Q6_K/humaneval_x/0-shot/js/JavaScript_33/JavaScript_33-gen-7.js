```
const sortThird = (l) => {
  return l.map((element, index) => {
    if (index % 3 === 0) {
      return [...new Set(l.slice(index, index + 3))].sort((a, b) => a - b)[0];
    } else {
      return element;
    }
  });
};
```


Here is a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. The function takes a list `l` as input.
2. It uses the `map` method to create a new list `l'`.
3. For each element `element` in `l`, it checks if the index `index` is divisible by 3 using the modulo operator (`index % 3 === 0`).
4. If the index is divisible by 3, it extracts a slice of the list `l` starting from the current index `index` and ending at the next index `index + 3` using `l.slice(index, index + 3)`.
5. It converts the slice into a Set to remove duplicates, sorts the Set using the `sort` method, and takes the first element of the sorted Set using `[0]`.
6. If the index is not divisible by 3, it simply returns the original element.
7. The resulting list `l'` is returned.

The function works as follows:

* For the elements at indices that are not divisible by 3, it leaves the elements unchanged.
* For the elements at indices that are divisible by 3, it takes the sorted values of the corresponding elements in the previous three indices and returns the first one.

For example, for the input `[5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]`, the function returns `[2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]`. The elements at indices 0, 1, and 2 are left unchanged, while the elements at indices 3, 6, and 9 are replaced with the sorted values of the corresponding elements in the previous three indices.
