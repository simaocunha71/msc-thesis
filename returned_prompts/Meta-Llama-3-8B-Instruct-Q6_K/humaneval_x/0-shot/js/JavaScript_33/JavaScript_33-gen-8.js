```
const sortThird = (l) => {
  return l.map((x, i) => i % 3 !== 0 ? x : l.slice(0, i).concat(...l.slice(i).sort((a, b) => a - b)));
};
```


Explanation:
This function uses the `map` method to create a new list `l'` where each element `x` at index `i` is either left unchanged if `i` is not divisible by 3, or replaced with a sorted version of the elements at index `i` and beyond if `i` is divisible by 3.

The condition `i % 3 !== 0` is used to check if `i` is not divisible by 3, and if so, the element `x` is left unchanged.

The condition `i % 3 === 0` is used to check if `i` is divisible by 3, and if so, the element `x` is replaced with a sorted version of the elements at index `i` and beyond.

The `slice(0, i)` method is used to get the elements before index `i`, and the `slice(i)` method is used to get the elements at index `i` and beyond. The `concat` method is used to concatenate these two slices, and the `sort` method is used to sort the resulting array.

The `...` operator is used to spread the sorted array into individual arguments for the `concat` method, so that the sorted elements are inserted into the original list at the correct position.
