Here is a Python solution using list comprehension and the built-in `sorted` function to sort the elements at indices divisible by 3:

```Python
def sortThird(l):
    return [x if i % 3 != 0 else sorted([x])[0] for i, x in enumerate(l)]
```

In this function, `enumerate` is used to get both the index and the value of each element in the list. The condition `i % 3 != 0` checks if the index is not divisible by 3. If the index is not divisible by 3, the original value is kept. If the index is divisible by 3, the value is replaced with the smallest value in the list at that index after sorting.

For example, if the input list is `[5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]`, the output will be `[2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]`. The elements at indices 0, 1, and 6 (which are not divisible by 3) remain the same, while the elements at indices 2 and 5 (which are divisible by 3) are replaced with the smallest value in the list at those indices after sorting.  This results in the list `[2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]`.
