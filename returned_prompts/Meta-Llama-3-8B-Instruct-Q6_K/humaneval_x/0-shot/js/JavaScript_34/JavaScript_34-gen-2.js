```
const unique = (l) => [...new Set(l)].sort((a, b) => a - b);
```


Explanation:
The function `unique` takes a list `l` as input. It uses the spread operator `...` to convert the set created from `l` into an array. The `Set` data structure automatically removes duplicates, so this step gives us an array of unique elements. Finally, the `sort` method is used to sort the array in ascending order.

Note: This function assumes that the input list `l` contains only comparable elements, i.e., elements that can be compared using the `===` operator. If the input list contains non-comparable elements (e.g., objects), this function may not work correctly. Also, the `sort` method has a time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the length of the input list. For large lists, this could be a performance bottleneck. In such cases, a more efficient sorting algorithm or a different approach might be necessary.
