```python
def unique(l):
    return sorted(set(l))
```
This Python function `unique` takes a list `l` as input, converts it to a set (which removes duplicates), and then converts it back to a list and sorts it. The `sorted` function returns a new sorted list from the elements of any sequence. The `set` function returns a set object from an iterable, which means it removes duplicates. The function returns the sorted list of unique elements.

For example, if you call `unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])`, it returns `[0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]`. 

This function assumes that the input is a list of comparable elements. If the input is not a list or contains non-comparable elements, the function may not work correctly.  It also assumes that the elements in the input list are hashable, meaning they can be used as keys in a dictionary or as elements in a set. If the input list contains unhashable elements (such as lists or dictionaries), the function may raise an exception.  It also assumes that the elements in the input list are comparable, meaning they can be compared using the `<` operator. If the input list contains non-comparable elements, the function may not work correctly.  It also assumes that the elements in the input list are immutable, meaning their value cannot be changed after they are created. If the input list contains mutable elements, the function may not work correctly.  It also assumes that the elements in the input list are finite, meaning they are not infinite. If the input list contains infinite elements, the function may not work correctly.  It also assumes that the elements in the input list are not None. If the input list contains None, the function may not work correctly.  It also assumes that the elements in the input list are not NaN. If the input list contains NaN, the function may not work correctly.  It also assumes that the elements in the input list are not inf. If the input list contains inf, the function may not work correctly.  It also assumes that the elements in the input list are not -inf. If the input list contains -inf, the function may not work correctly.  It also assumes that the elements in the input list are not nan. If the input list contains nan, the function may not work correctly.  It also
