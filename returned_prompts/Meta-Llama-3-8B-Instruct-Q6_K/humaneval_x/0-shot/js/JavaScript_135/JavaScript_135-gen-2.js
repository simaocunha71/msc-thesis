Here is a JavaScript solution for the problem:

```javascript
const canArrange = (arr) => {
  let maxIndex = -1;
  for(let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if(arr[i] <= arr[i-1]) {
      maxIndex = i;
    }
  }
  return maxIndex;
};
```

Explanation:

*   We initialize `maxIndex` to -1, which will be returned if no such element is found.
*   We iterate through the array starting from the second element (index 1).
*   For each element, we check if it is less than or equal to the previous element. If it is, we update `maxIndex` to the current index.
*   After the loop, we return `maxIndex`, which is the largest index of an element that is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. If no such element exists, `maxIndex` remains -1.
