This problem is asking for the largest index of an element in the array that is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. If no such element exists, return -1.

Here's the solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
const canArrange = (arr) => {
    let result = -1;
    for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] <= arr[i - 1]) {
            result = i - 1;
            break;
        }
    }
    return result;
};
```

This function iterates through the array starting from the second element. If it finds an element that is not greater than or equal to the previous element, it updates the result with the index of that element minus one (because array indices start at 0) and breaks out of the loop. If it doesn't find such an element, the result remains -1.

Let's test this function with the examples provided:

```javascript
console.log(canArrange([1, 2, 4, 3, 5])); // Output: 3
console.log(canArrange([1, 2, 3])); // Output: -1
```


This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array, because it iterates through the array once. The space complexity is O(1), because it uses a constant amount of space to store the result.
