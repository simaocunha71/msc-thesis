Here is the JavaScript code that solves the problem:

```javascript
const canArrange = (arr) => {
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] <= arr[i - 1]) {
      return i - 1;
    }
  }
  return -1;
};
```

Explanation:
This function iterates through the array and checks if the current element is less than or equal to the previous element. If it finds such an element, it returns the index of the previous element. If it doesn't find any such element, it returns -1. The function assumes that the array does not contain duplicate values. The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the array. The space complexity is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space.

You can test this function with the examples you provided:

```javascript
console.log(canArrange([1,2,4,3,5])); // Output: 3
console.log(canArrange([1,2,3])); // Output: -1
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
