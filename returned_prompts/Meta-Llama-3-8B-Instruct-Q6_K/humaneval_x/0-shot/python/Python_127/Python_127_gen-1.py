    start2, end2 = interval2

The function `intersection` calculates the intersection of two intervals and checks whether its length is a prime number. 

First, it calculates the start and end of the intersection by taking the maximum of the start of the two intervals and the minimum of the end of the two intervals. 

Then, it checks if the intersection is empty by comparing the start and end of the intersection. If the start is greater than the end, the intervals do not intersect and the function returns "NO".

Finally, it checks if the length of the intersection is a prime number by iterating from 2 to the square root of the length and checking if the length is divisible by any of these numbers. If it is, the length is not a prime number and the function returns "NO". Otherwise, the length is a prime number and the function returns "YES". 





Test cases:

```
print(intersection((1, 2), (2, 3)))  # "NO"
print(intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4)))  # "NO"
print(intersection((-3, -1), (-5, 5)))  # "YES"
```





The function `intersection` correctly identifies whether the length of the intersection of two intervals is a prime number. It works by first calculating the intersection of the two intervals, and then checking if the length of the intersection is a prime number. The function correctly handles the cases where the intervals do not intersect, and returns "NO" in these cases. The function also correctly identifies the cases where the length of the intersection is a prime number, and returns "YES" in these cases.
