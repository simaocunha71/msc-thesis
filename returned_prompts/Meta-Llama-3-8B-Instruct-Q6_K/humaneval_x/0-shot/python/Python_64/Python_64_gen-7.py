Explanation:
The `vowels_count` function takes a string `s` as input and returns the number of vowels in the string. The function first converts the string to lowercase using the `lower()` method, so that it treats 'A' and 'a' as the same vowel.

The function then initializes a counter `count` to 0. It iterates over each character `char` in the string using a for loop. If the character is in the string 'aeiou', it increments the `count` by 1. If the character is 'y' and it is at the end of the string (i.e., `s.index(char) == len(s) - 1`), it also increments the `count` by 1.

Finally, the function returns the `count`, which represents the number of vowels in the input string.

The example test cases provided in the problem statement are:
```
>>> vowels_count("abcde")
2
>>> vowels_count("ACEDY")
3
```
These test cases demonstrate that the function correctly counts the number of vowels in a string, including the special case where 'y' is at the end of the string.
