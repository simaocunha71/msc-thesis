Explanation:
The function `vowels_count` takes a string `s` as input and returns the number of vowels in the string. It first converts the string to lowercase to simplify the vowel check. Then it iterates over each character in the string. If the character is 'y' and it's at the end of the string, it counts it as a vowel. If the character is in 'aeiou', it counts it as a vowel. Finally, it returns the total count of vowels.

Test Cases:
1. `vowels_count("abcde")` should return `2` because 'a' and 'e' are vowels.
2. `vowels_count("ACEDY")` should return `3` because 'a', 'e', and 'y' are vowels. 'y' is counted as a vowel because it's at the end of the string.
3. `vowels_count("Hello")` should return `2` because 'e' and 'o' are vowels.
4. `vowels_count("aeiou")` should return `5` because all characters are vowels.
5. `vowels_count("bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz")` should return `0` because no characters are vowels.
