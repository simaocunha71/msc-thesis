The problem is asking to create a function that calculates the nth element of the Fib4 sequence, which is a sequence that follows the rules: 
fib4(0) = 0, fib4(1) = 0, fib4(2) = 2, fib4(3) = 0, and for n >= 4, fib4(n) = fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4).

Here is a Python function that calculates the nth element of the Fib4 sequence efficiently without using recursion:
```python
def fib4(n: int):
    if n < 4:
        return [0, 0, 2, 0][n]
    fib4_sequence = [0, 0, 2, 0]
    for i in range(4, n):
        fib4_sequence.append(fib4_sequence[i-1] + fib4_sequence[i-2] + fib4_sequence[i-3] + fib4_sequence[i-4])
    return fib4_sequence[-1]
```
This function works by first handling the base cases (n < 4) and then calculating the rest of the sequence iteratively. It uses a list to store the calculated values and returns the last element of the list, which is the nth element of the Fib4 sequence.

The time complexity of this function is O(n) because it needs to iterate over the sequence to calculate each element. The space complexity is also O(n) because it stores the calculated values in a list.
