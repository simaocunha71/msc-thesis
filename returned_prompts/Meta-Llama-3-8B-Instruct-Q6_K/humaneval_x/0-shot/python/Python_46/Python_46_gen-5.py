The problem asks to compute the nth element of the Fib4 number sequence, which is defined as follows:
fib4(0) = 0
fib4(1) = 0
fib4(2) = 2
fib4(3) = 0
fib4(n) = fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4)

We can solve this problem using dynamic programming, which is an efficient method for solving problems that have overlapping subproblems.

Here is the Python solution:

```Python
def fib4(n: int):
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("n must be a non-negative integer")
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    if n == 2:
        return 2
    fib4_values = [0, 0, 2, 0]
    for i in range(4, n+1):
        fib4_values.append(fib4_values[i-1] + fib4_values[i-2] + fib4_values[i-3] + fib4_values[i-4])
    return fib4_values[n]
```

The function `fib4(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth element of the Fib4 number sequence. It first checks if `n` is less than 0, in which case it raises a `ValueError`. If `n` is 0, 1, or 2, it returns the corresponding value. If `n` is greater than 2, it initializes a list `fib4_values` with the first four values of the sequence and then calculates the remaining values using the formula `fib4_values[i] = fib4_values[i-1] + fib4_values[i-2] + fib4_values[i-3] + fib4_values[i-4]`. Finally, it returns the nth element of the sequence.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), which is the best we can do for this problem since we need to compute the first n elements of the sequence. The space complexity is also O(n), since we need to store the first n elements of the sequence.

This solution is efficient and can handle large values of `n`. For example, `fib4(100)` can be computed in a reasonable amount of time. However, it may not be suitable for very large values of `n`, in which case a more efficient algorithm may
