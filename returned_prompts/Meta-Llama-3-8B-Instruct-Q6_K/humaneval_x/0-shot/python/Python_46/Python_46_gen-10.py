The problem asks to create a function that calculates the nth element of the fib4 number sequence. The fib4 sequence is defined as follows:
fib4(0) = 0
fib4(1) = 0
fib4(2) = 2
fib4(3) = 0
fib4(n) = fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4)

The problem does not allow the use of recursion, so we will use a loop to calculate the nth element.

Here is the Python solution for the problem:

```
def fib4(n: int):
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("n must be a non-negative integer")
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 0
    if n == 2:
        return 2
    fib4_values = [0, 0, 2, 0]
    for i in range(4, n+1):
        fib4_values.append(fib4_values[i-1] + fib4_values[i-2] + fib4_values[i-3] + fib4_values[i-4])
    return fib4_values[n]
```

The function first checks if the input is valid. Then it initializes a list `fib4_values` with the base cases of the fib4 sequence. It then uses a loop to calculate the rest of the sequence. The nth element of the sequence is calculated by adding the (n-1)th, (n-2)th, (n-3)th, and (n-4)th elements. Finally, the function returns the nth element of the sequence.
