        count = sum(1 for c in s if int(c) % 2 != 0)

    return result

Explanation:
The function odd_count takes a list of strings as input, where each string consists of only digits. It iterates over the input list using the enumerate function, which returns both the index i and the value s of each element. For each string, it counts the number of odd digits using a generator expression and sums them up using the sum function. The result is then used to construct a string with the desired format and appended to the result list. Finally, the function returns the list of strings.

For example, when called with the input ['1234567'], the function will iterate over the list once, counting the number of odd digits in the string '1234567', which is 4. The function will then construct the string "the number of odd elements 4n the str4ng 4 of the 4nput." and append it to the result list. The function will return the list ['the number of odd elements 4n the str4ng 4 of the 4nput.']. Similarly, when called with the input ['3',"11111111"], the function will iterate over the list twice, counting the number of odd digits in the strings '3' and '11111111', which are 1 and 8, respectively. The function will then construct the strings "the number of odd elements 1n the str1ng 1 of the 1nput." and "the number of odd elements 8n the str8ng 8 of the 8nput." and append them to the result list. The function will return the list ['the number of odd elements 1n the str1ng 1 of the 1nput.', "the number of odd elements 8n the str8ng 8 of the 8nput."].
