```
def odd_count(lst):
    return [f"the number of odd elements {count}n the str{str(i+1)}ng {i+1} of the {i+1}nput." for i, s in enumerate(lst) for count in [str(s.count(str(int(digit) % 2))) for digit in s]]
```
This function uses list comprehension to iterate over each string in the input list, and for each string, it counts the number of odd digits and replaces the i's with the number of odd digits. The output is a list of strings where each string represents the number of odd digits in the corresponding string of the input.

For example, for the input ['1234567'], the output will be ["the number of odd elements 4n the str4ng 4 of the 4nput."]. For the input ['3',"11111111"], the output will be ["the number of odd elements 1n the str1ng 1 of the 1nput.", "the number of odd elements 8n the str8ng 8 of the 8nput."]. 

This solution assumes that the input list is not empty and all strings in the list consist of only digits. If these assumptions are not valid, you may need to add error handling code. 

The time complexity of this solution is O(n*m), where n is the number of strings in the input list and m is the average length of a string. This is because we are iterating over each string and each digit in each string. The space complexity is O(n*m) as well, as we are creating a new list of strings. 

The function f-string is used to format the output string. It allows you to embed expressions inside string literals, using curly braces {}. The expression can be a variable, a function call, or a literal value. The expression is replaced with its string representation. The expression is evaluated at runtime, so it can be any valid Python expression. 

The expression {count} is replaced with the string representation of the count of odd digits. The expression {str(i+1)} is replaced with the string representation of the index of the string in the input list, plus one (because list indices start at 0). The expression {i+1} is replaced with the string representation of the index of the string in the input list, plus one. The expression {i+1} is replaced with the string representation of the index of the
