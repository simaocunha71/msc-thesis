The function `odd_count` takes a list of strings as input, where each string consists of only digits. It then iterates over the input list, and for each string, it counts the number of odd digits using a generator expression. The result is a new list of strings, where each string is a formatted string that describes the number of odd digits in the corresponding string of the input.

For example, if the input is `['1234567']`, the output will be `["the number of odd elements 4n the str4ng 4 of the 4nput."]`. If the input is `['3',"11111111"]`, the output will be `["the number of odd elements 1n the str1ng 1 of the 1nput.", "the number of odd elements 8n the str8ng 8 of the 8nput."]`. 

The `enumerate` function is used to get both the index and the value of each element in the input list. The `f-string` is used to format the output string. The `sum` function is used to count the number of odd digits in each string. The generator expression `(1 for c in s if int(c) % 2 != 0)` is used to count the number of odd digits in each string. The `int(c) % 2 != 0` expression checks if a digit is odd. If it is, it returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`. The `sum` function adds up all the `True` values, which corresponds to the number of odd digits in the string.  A `True` value is equivalent to `1` in a sum, so the `sum` function effectively counts the number of `True` values, which is the number of odd digits. 

The time complexity of this function is O(n*m), where n is the number of strings in the input list, and m is the length of each string. The space complexity is O(n), as we need to store the output list. 

The function is case-sensitive, and it assumes that all strings in the input list
