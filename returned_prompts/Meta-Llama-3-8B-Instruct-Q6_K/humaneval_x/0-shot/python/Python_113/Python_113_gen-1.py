# Explanation:
# The function takes a list of strings as input. It then iterates over each string in the list. For each string, it counts the number of odd digits, replaces 'i' with the index of the string in the list, and replaces 'n' with 'n' in the resulting string. Finally, it returns the list of strings.  # or use list comprehension
# 
# The unit tests show that the function should return a list of strings where each string contains the number of odd elements in the corresponding string of the input. The number of odd elements is counted by iterating over each digit in the string and checking if it is odd. The index of the string in the list is replaced by the number of odd elements.  # or use list comprehension
# 
# The function can be optimized by using list comprehension, which is a concise way to create a new list from an existing iterable. The list comprehension iterates over each string in the input list, counts the number of odd digits, and replaces 'i' with the index of the string in the list. Finally, it returns the list of strings.  # or use list comprehension
