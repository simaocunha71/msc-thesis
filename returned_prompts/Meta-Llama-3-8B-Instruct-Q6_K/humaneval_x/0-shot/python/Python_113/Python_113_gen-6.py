The correct answer is D.

The problem description is asking for a list of strings, where each string consists of only digits, and each element i of the output should be "the number of odd elements in the string i of the input." where all the i's should be replaced by the number of odd digits in the i'th string of the input.

The code should iterate over the input list, count the number of odd digits in each string, and then replace the i's in the output string with the count of odd digits.

The correct code is D, which replaces the i's with the count of odd digits in each string. The other options do not correctly replace the i's with the count of odd digits. Option A, B, and C replace the i's with the string index i+1, which is not the correct solution. Option C also incorrectly replaces the string with the string index i+1, which is not the correct solution. Option B also incorrectly replaces the string with the string index i+1, which is not the correct solution. Option A, B, and C do not correctly replace the i's
