The provided code defines a function called `get_positive` which takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the positive numbers from the original list. The function uses a list comprehension to achieve this.

The unit tests provided demonstrate the functionality of the function. For example, when the input is `[-1, 2, -4, 5, 6]`, the function returns `[2, 5, 6]`, which are the positive numbers from the original list.

The function can be further modified to filter out non-integer values by adding an additional condition to the list comprehension. For example:
```
return [i for i in l if isinstance(i, int) and i > 0]
```
This will return a list containing only the positive integer values from the original list.  # noqa: E501

However, the function will still return non-integer positive numbers, such as floats. If you want to filter out non-integer positive numbers as well, you can use the `isinstance` function to check if the value is an integer before checking if it's positive.  # noqa: E501

Here are some examples of how you can use the function:
```
print(get_positive([-1, 2, -4, 5, 6]))  # Output: [2, 5, 6]
print(get_positive([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]))  # Output: [5, 3, 2, 3, 9, 123, 1]
```
Note that the function does not modify the original list, but returns a new list containing the positive numbers.  # noqa: E501

You can also use the `filter` function to achieve the same result:
```
return list(filter(lambda x: x > 0, l))
```
This will return a list containing
