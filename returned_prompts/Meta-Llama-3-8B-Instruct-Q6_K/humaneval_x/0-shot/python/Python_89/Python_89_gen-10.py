Explanation:

The function encrypt takes a string as an argument and returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being rotated. The alphabet is rotated in a manner such that the letters shift down by two multiplied to two places.

The function iterates over each character in the string. If the character is a letter (checked using the isalpha method), it calculates the new ASCII value of the character after rotation. The rotation is done by subtracting the ASCII value of 'A' (65) or 'a' (97) depending on whether the character is uppercase or lowercase, adding the shift value (4 * 2), and then taking the result modulo 26 to ensure that the rotation wraps around the alphabet.

If the character is not a letter (e.g., a space or punctuation mark), it is left unchanged.

The function returns the encrypted string.
