            ascii_offset = 65 if char.isupper() else 97
            result += chr((ord(char) - ascii_offset + 4 * 2) % 26 + ascii_offset)

The given Python function `encrypt` takes a string `s` as an argument and returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being rotated. The alphabet is rotated in a manner such that the letters shift down by two multiplied to two places. This is done by adding 4 * 2 to the ASCII value of each letter, which effectively moves the letter down by 8 places in the alphabet. The modulus operator `% 26` is used to ensure that the rotation wraps around the alphabet.

In the function, we iterate over each character in the input string `s`. If the character is a letter (checked using `isalpha()`), we calculate its new ASCII value by adding 4 * 2 to its current ASCII value. We then convert this new ASCII value back to a character using `chr()`. If the character is not a letter (e.g., a space or punctuation mark), we simply add it to the result string unchanged.

Finally, the function returns the encrypted string `result`. For example, `encrypt('hi')` returns 'lm', `encrypt('asdfghjkl')` returns 'ewhjklnop', `encrypt('gf')` returns 'kj', and `encrypt('et')` returns 'ix'.
