```
def anti_shuffle(s):
    words = s.split()
    return ' '.join(''.join(sorted(word)) for word in words)
```





The provided Python function, `anti_shuffle`, takes a string `s` as input and returns an ordered version of it. The ordered version is created by replacing each word in the string with a new word where all the characters are arranged in ascending order based on their ASCII values.

The function works as follows:

1. It splits the input string into a list of words using the `split` method.
2. It then uses a generator expression to iterate over each word in the list.
3. For each word, it uses the `sorted` function to sort the characters in the word in ascending order based on their ASCII values.
4. The sorted characters are then joined together using the `join` method to form a new word.
5. The new words are then joined together using the `join` method with a space separator to form the final ordered string.

The function is tested with the provided examples, and it returns the expected results. For example, `anti_shuffle('Hi')` returns `'Hi'`, `anti_shuffle('hello')` returns `'ehllo'`, and `anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!')` returns `'Hello !!!Wdlor'`.
