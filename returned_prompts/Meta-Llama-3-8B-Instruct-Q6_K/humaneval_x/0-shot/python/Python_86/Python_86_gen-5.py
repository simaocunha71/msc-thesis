def anti_shuffle(s):
    words = s.split()
    ordered_words = [''.join(sorted(word)) for word in words]
    return ' '.join(ordered_words)
```


Explanation:
The function anti_shuffle takes a string as an argument and returns an ordered version of it. It first splits the string into words using the split() function. Then, it uses a list comprehension to create a new list of words where each word is sorted in ascending order based on ASCII values using the sorted() function. The sorted words are then joined back into a string with spaces in between using the join() function. The result is the ordered version of the string.

For example, if the input string is 'Hello World!!!', the function will first split it into ['Hello', 'World!!!']. Then, it will sort each word into ['Helll', 'oWrdo!']. Finally, it will join the sorted words back into 'Helll oWrdo!'. If the input string is 'Hi', it will return 'Hi' because 'Hi' is already in ascending order. If the input string is 'hello', it will return 'ehllo' because 'hello' is already in ascending order. If the input string is 'Hello !!!Wdlor', it will return 'Hello !!!Wdlor' because it is already in ascending order.
