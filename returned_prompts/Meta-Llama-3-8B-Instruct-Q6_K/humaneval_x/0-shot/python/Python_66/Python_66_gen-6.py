Explanation:
The task is to create a function that takes a string as input and returns the sum of the ASCII codes of the upper-case characters in the string. 

The function `digitSum` iterates over each character in the input string. If the character is an upper-case letter, it adds the ASCII code of that character to the sum. The ASCII code of a character is obtained using the built-in `ord` function in Python.

In the provided examples, the function returns the expected results. For instance, `digitSum("abAB")` returns 131, which is the sum of the ASCII codes of 'A' and 'B' (65 and 66 respectively). Similarly, `digitSum("abcCd")` returns 67, which is the sum of the ASCII codes of 'C' and 'D' (67 and 68 respectively). 

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because it needs to iterate over each character in the string once. The space complexity is O(1), because it uses a constant amount of space to store the sum and the current character. 2

1.  The provided function will only work with strings containing ASCII characters.
2.  The function does not handle non-ASCII characters. If the input string contains non-ASCII characters, the function may not work correctly. 
3.  The function does not handle non-string inputs. If the input is not a string, the function will raise a TypeError when trying to iterate over it.
4.  The function does not handle edge cases. For example, if the input string is empty, the function will return 0, which may not be the expected result. 
5.  The function does not handle non-English characters. If the input string contains non-English characters, the function may not work correctly. 
6.  The function does not handle special characters. If the input string contains special characters, the function may not work correctly. 
7.  The function does not handle digits. If the input string contains digits, the function may not work correctly. 
8.  The function does not handle whitespace characters. If the input string contains whitespace characters, the function may not work correctly. 
9.  The function does not
