The function right_angle_triangle checks if the three sides of a triangle form a right-angled triangle. It does this by using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

The function takes three arguments, a, b, and c, which are the lengths of the three sides of the triangle. It then checks if the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides is equal to the square of the longest side. If this condition is met, it returns True, indicating that the three sides form a right-angled triangle. Otherwise, it returns False.

Here's how the function works:

1. It first checks if the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides (a and b) is equal to the square of the longest side (c). If this condition is met, it returns True.
2. If the first condition is not met, it checks if the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides (a and c) is equal to the square of the longest side (b). If this condition is met, it returns True.
3. If the first two conditions are not met, it checks if the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides (b and c) is equal to the square of the longest side (a). If this condition is met, it returns True.
4. If none of the above conditions are met, it returns False, indicating that the three sides do not form a right-angled triangle.

Here's an example of how the function works:

```
right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5)  # Returns True
right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3)  # Returns False
```

In the first example, the function checks if the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides (3 and 4) is equal to the square of the longest side (5). It finds that 3^2 + 4^2
