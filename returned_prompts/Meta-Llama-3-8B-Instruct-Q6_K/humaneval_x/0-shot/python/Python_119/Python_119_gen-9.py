This function uses a stack to keep track of the open parentheses. It iterates over the strings in the input list. When it encounters an open parenthesis, it pushes it onto the stack. When it encounters a close parenthesis, it checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means there's no matching open parenthesis, so it returns 'No'. If the stack is not empty, it pops the open parenthesis from the stack. At the end of the function, it checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means all parentheses were matched, so it returns 'Yes'. If the stack is not empty, it means there were unmatched open parentheses, so it returns 'No'. 





The time complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the total number of characters in the input list. This is because the function iterates over the list once. The space complexity is O(n), where n is the total number of open parentheses in the input list. This is because the function uses a stack to keep track of the open parentheses. The maximum size of the stack is equal to the total number of open parentheses in the input list.
