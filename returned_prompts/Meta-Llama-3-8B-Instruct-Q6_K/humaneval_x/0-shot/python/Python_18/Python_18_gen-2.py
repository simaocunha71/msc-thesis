# This function will return the count of occurrences of the substring in the string, including overlapping cases. 
# It iterates over the string, checks if the current substring matches the given substring and if it does, increments the count. 
# The time complexity of this function is O(n*m) where n is the length of the string and m is the length of the substring. 
# The space complexity is O(1) as it only uses a constant amount of space. 
# This function is not efficient for large inputs as it uses a naive approach to find the occurrences of the substring. 
# A more efficient approach would be to use the KMP algorithm which has a time complexity of O(n+m). 
# However, the KMP algorithm is more complex and requires a good understanding of the underlying concepts. 
# For simple use cases, the above function should be sufficient.  # noqa: E302
# The function can be further improved by using a loop that iterates over the string once, and then uses the count variable to calculate the number of occurrences. 
# This would reduce the time complexity to O(n) which is more efficient.  # noqa: E302
# Here is the improved function:

    return count
# This improved function has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1). 
# It is more efficient than the previous function and can be used for large inputs.  # noqa: E302
