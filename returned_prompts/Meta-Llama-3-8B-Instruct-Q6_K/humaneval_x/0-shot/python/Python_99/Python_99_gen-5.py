The provided solution correctly implements the problem statement. It first attempts to convert the input value to a float. If the conversion is successful, it checks if the value is already an integer. If it is, the function simply returns the integer value.

If the value is not an integer, the function checks if the value is positive. If it is, it rounds the value up to the nearest integer by adding 0.5 and then converting the result to an integer.

If the value is negative, the function rounds the value down to the nearest integer by subtracting 0.5 and then converting the result to an integer.

If the conversion to a float fails (i.e., the input value is not a valid number), the function returns None.

Here is an example of how to use the function:

```
print(closest_integer("10"))  # Output: 10
print(closest_integer("15.3"))  # Output: 15
print(closest_integer("14.5"))  # Output: 15
print(closest_integer("-14.5"))  # Output: -15
print(closest_integer("abc"))  # Output: None
```

This solution meets all the requirements specified in the problem statement, including the rounding away from zero rule. It also handles invalid input values by returning None.
