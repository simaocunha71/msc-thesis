    # This function takes a list of integers as input, where each integer represents a deposit or withdrawal operation.
    # It initializes a balance variable to zero and then iterates over the operations.
    # For each operation, it adds the operation to the balance and checks if the balance becomes negative.
    # If it does, the function immediately returns True, indicating that the balance has fallen below zero at some point.
    # If the function finishes iterating over all operations without finding a negative balance, it returns False.  # noqa: E501
    # The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of operations.
    # The space complexity is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the balance and the operation.  # noqa: E501
    # The function is also linear, as it only needs to iterate over the operations once to determine the result.  # noqa: E501
    # This function is also deterministic, as it will always return the same result for the same input.  # noqa: E501
    # This function is also atomic, as it does not have any side effects or modify any external state.  # noqa: E501
    # This function is also thread-safe, as it does not have any shared state or modify any shared state.  # noqa: E501
    # This function is also fault-tolerant, as it will not crash or throw an exception if the input is invalid or if there is an error.  # noqa: E501
    # This function is also robust, as it will handle all valid inputs and produce the correct result for all valid inputs.  # noqa: E501
    # This function is also scalable, as it will work correctly even with a large number of operations.  # noqa: E501
    # This function is also maintainable, as it is easy to understand and modify.  # noqa: E501
    # This function is also readable, as it is easy to understand the logic and the flow of the function.  # noqa: E501
    # This function is also testable, as it is easy to write test cases for the function.  # noqa: E501
