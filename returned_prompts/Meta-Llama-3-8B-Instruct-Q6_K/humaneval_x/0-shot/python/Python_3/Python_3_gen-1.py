    # This function iterates over the list of operations and for each operation adds it to the balance.
    # If the balance ever falls below zero, the function immediately returns True. If the loop completes
    # without the balance falling below zero, the function returns False. 
    # This function assumes that the input list contains only integers, and that the list is not empty. 
    # It also assumes that the first operation is a deposit (i.e. it adds to the balance), 
    # and that subsequent operations are either deposits or withdrawals. 
    # If these assumptions are not valid, the function may not work correctly. 
    # For example, if the list contains a string, the function will raise a TypeError. 
    # If the list is empty, the function will return False, which may not be the expected result. 
    # If the list contains a mix of deposits and withdrawals, the function will not work correctly. 
    # To handle these cases, you would need to add error checking code to the function. 
    # For example, you could use a try/except block to catch and handle any TypeError that occurs. 
    # You could also add a check to make sure the list is not empty, and return a default value if it is. 
    # You could also add a check to make sure the operations are either deposits or withdrawals, 
    # and return an error message if they are not. 
    # Here is an example of how you could add some of this error checking code: 
    # def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    #     if not operations:
    #         return False
    #     for operation in operations:
    #         if not isinstance(operation, int):
    #             raise TypeError("The list of operations must contain only integers.")
    #         if operation < 0:
    #             return True
    #     return False 
    # This version of the function will handle the cases where the input list is empty, 
    # or where the list contains a string or a non-integer value. 
    # It will also handle the case where the balance never falls below zero, 
    # and will return False in that case. 
    # However,
