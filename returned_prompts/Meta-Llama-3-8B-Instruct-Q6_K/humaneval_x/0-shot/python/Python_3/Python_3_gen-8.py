def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:

        balance += operation
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
    # This function goes through the list of operations, adding each one to the balance.
    # If the balance ever becomes negative, it returns True. If it gets through the entire list
    # without the balance ever falling below zero, it returns False. 
    # This is a very simple function and it assumes that the operations are just deposit and withdrawal
    # and not things like transfer between accounts or interest. 
    # It also assumes that the list of operations is not empty. 
    # If you want to add error checking for these things, you could do that. 
    # For example, you could check if the balance becomes negative before you return True, or you could
    # check if the list of operations is empty before you start going through it. 
    # You could also check if the operations are all non-negative, or if they are all non-positive. 
    # You could also add a message to the return value, so that the person who is using this
    # function can tell why it returned what it did. 
    # For example, you could return "Balance fell below zero" when the balance falls below zero, 
    # and "Balance never fell below zero" when it doesn't. 
    # You could also return the balance when it does or doesn't fall below zero, so that the
    # person who is using this function can see the final balance. 
    # You could also add a message to the return value that says whether the balance started
    # out positive or negative. 
    # You could also return the number of operations that were performed before the balance
    # fell below zero, or the number of operations that were performed before the balance
    # never fell below zero. 
    # There are many ways to extend this function to make it more useful for the person who is
    # using it. 
    # For example, you could add a parameter that lets the person who is using the function
    # specify the initial balance. 
    # You could also add a parameter that lets the person who is using the function specify
    # the message that gets returned when the balance falls below zero or when it doesn't. 
    # You could also
