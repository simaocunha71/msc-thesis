def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
    # This function initializes the balance to 0 and then iterates over the list of operations.
    # For each operation, it adds the operation to the balance. If the balance ever falls below 0,
    # it immediately returns True. If it finishes iterating over all operations without the balance
    # falling below 0, it returns False. 
    # For example, below_zero([1, 2, 3]) returns False because the balance never falls below 0.
    # On the other hand, below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) returns True because the balance does fall below 0. 
    # This function assumes that all operations are either positive (deposit) or negative (withdrawal).
    # It does not check for invalid operations, such as 0 or a non-integer. 
    # It also does not check for operations that are not integers, such as floating point numbers. 
    # For a more robust function, you might want to add error checking code. 
    # For example, you might want to check that all operations are either positive or negative, 
    # and that they are all integers. 
    # You might also want to add a check to make sure that the balance never exceeds the maximum 
    # value that can be represented by the computer's memory. 
    # This is not necessary in this case, because the balance is only ever increased or decreased, 
    # and it is never increased by more than the maximum value that can be represented. 
    # It is also never decreased below the minimum value that can be represented, because it can 
    # only be decreased by subtracting a positive value. 
    # However, in a more general case, you might need to add this check. 
    # For example, if you were keeping track of the balance of a credit card account, 
    # you would need to make sure that the balance never exceeds the maximum value that can be 
    # represented by the computer's memory, because a credit card company might charge a fee 
    # if the balance exceeds a certain amount. 
    # Similarly, you might need to make sure that the balance never falls below a certain minimum 
    # value
