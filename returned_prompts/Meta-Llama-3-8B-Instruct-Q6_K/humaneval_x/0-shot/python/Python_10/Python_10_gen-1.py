The problem asks you to create a function that takes a string as input and returns the shortest palindrome that starts with the input string. 

Here is a Python solution for the problem:

```Python
def make_palindrome(s: str) -> str:
    if s == s[::-1]:
        return s

    for i in range(len(s)):
        prefix = s[:i]
        postfix = s[i:]
        if postfix == postfix[::-1]:
            return prefix + postfix + postfix[::-1]

    return s + s[::-1]
```

In this solution, we first check if the input string is already a palindrome. If it is, we simply return the string itself. 

If the string is not a palindrome, we try to find the longest postfix that is a palindrome. We do this by iterating over the string and checking if the postfix of the string starting from each position is a palindrome. 

Once we find the longest postfix that is a palindrome, we append the reverse of the prefix of the string that comes before the palindromic suffix to the end of the string. This results in the shortest palindrome that starts with the input string. 

If we cannot find a postfix that is a palindrome, we simply append the reverse of the entire string to the end of the string, which results in the shortest palindrome that starts with the input string. 

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input string, because we are iterating over the string and checking if each postfix is a palindrome. The space complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because we are storing the prefix and postfix of the string.
