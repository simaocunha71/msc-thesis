Here is the solution to the problem:

```python
def is_palindrome(string: str) -> bool:
    """ Test if given string is a palindrome """
    return string == string[::-1]

def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    """ Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string.
    Algorithm idea is simple:
    - Find the longest postfix of supplied string that is a palindrome.
    - Append to the end of the string reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.
    """
    # Reverse the string to find the longest postfix that is a palindrome
    postfix = string[::-1]
    
    # Find the longest common prefix between the original string and the reversed postfix
    i = 0
    while i < len(string) and string[i] == postfix[i]:
        i += 1
    
    # The shortest palindrome is formed by appending the remaining reversed postfix to the original string
    return string + postfix[i:]
```


This solution first checks if the input string is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse. Then, it uses a similar approach to find the shortest palindrome that begins with the input string. It does this by finding the longest common prefix between the input string and its reverse, and then appending the remaining reversed postfix to the end of the input string. This ensures that the resulting string is a palindrome and is as short as possible. The function `make_palindrome` returns the shortest palindrome that begins with the input string.
