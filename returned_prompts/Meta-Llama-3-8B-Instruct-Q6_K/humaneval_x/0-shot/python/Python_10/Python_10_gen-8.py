Here is the Python code for the `make_palindrome` function:
```
def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    """ Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string.
    Algorithm idea is simple:
    - Find the longest postfix of supplied string that is a palindrome.
    - Append to the end of the string reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.
    """
    # Find the longest postfix of supplied string that is a palindrome
    for i in range(len(string), -1, -1):
        postfix = string[:i][::-1]
        if postfix + string[i:] == string[::-1]:
            return postfix + string
    return string[::-1] + string
```
The `make_palindrome` function takes a string as input and returns the shortest palindrome that begins with the input string. The algorithm works by finding the longest postfix of the input string that is a palindrome, and then appending the reverse of the string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.

The function uses a loop to iterate over the length of the input string in reverse order, and for each iteration, it checks if the postfix of the string (obtained by slicing the string from the beginning to the current position) is a palindrome by comparing it with the reverse of the string. If it is a palindrome, the function returns the postfix concatenated with the rest of the string.

If no palindrome postfix is found, the function returns the reverse of the entire string concatenated with the original string. This is because the shortest palindrome that begins with the input string is the reverse of the input string concatenated with the input string itself.

The `is_palindrome` function is not needed in this implementation, but it can be used as a helper function to check if a given string is a palindrome. For example:
```
def is_palindrome(string: str) -> bool:
    return string == string[::-1]
```
This function takes a string as input and returns `True` if the string is a palindrome, and `False` otherwise. It does this by comparing the input string with its reverse. If the two strings are equal, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The `is_palindrome` function can be used in the `make_palindrome` function to check if a postfix is a palindrome. For example:
```
if is_palindrome(postfix + string[i:]):
    return postfix + string
```
This code checks if the
