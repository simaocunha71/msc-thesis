Here is a Python code snippet that implements the `make_palindrome` function:
```python
def is_palindrome(string: str) -> bool:
    """ Test if given string is a palindrome """
    return string == string[::-1]


def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    """ Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string.
    Algorithm idea is simple:
    - Find the longest postfix of supplied string that is a palindrome.
    - Append to the end of the string reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.
    """
    # Find the longest postfix of supplied string that is a palindrome
    i = 0
    while i < len(string):
        if is_palindrome(string[i:]):
            break
        i += 1

    # Append to the end of the string reverse of a string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix
    return string + string[:i][::-1]
```
This code uses the `is_palindrome` function to check if a given string is a palindrome. The `make_palindrome` function finds the longest postfix of the supplied string that is a palindrome, and then appends the reverse of the string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix to the end of the string. This results in the shortest palindrome that begins with the supplied string. Here is an example of how to use the `make_palindrome` function:
```python
print(make_palindrome(''))  # Output: ''
print(make_palindrome('cat'))  # Output: 'catac'
print(make_palindrome('cata'))  # Output: 'catac'
```
