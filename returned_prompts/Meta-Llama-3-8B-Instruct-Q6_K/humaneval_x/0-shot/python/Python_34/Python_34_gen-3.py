    return sorted(set(l))  # Convert the list to a set, which removes duplicates, and then convert it back to a list and sort it. 
    # The set operation has a time complexity of O(n) and the sorting operation has a time complexity of O(n log n), so the overall time complexity is O(n log n)
    # The space complexity is O(n) because we need to store the unique elements in the set and the sorted list. 
    # We can also use a dictionary to achieve the same result with a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n)
    # For example: return sorted({x: None for x in l}.keys()) 
    # This solution uses a dictionary to keep track of the unique elements, and the keys method is used to get the unique elements in the order they were inserted. 
    # This solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), but it is less efficient than the previous solution for large inputs because it uses more memory.  # noqa: E501
    # It's worth noting that the order of the elements in the output is not guaranteed to be the same as the order in the input list, because sets are unordered data structures. 
    # If you need to preserve the order of the elements, you can use a different approach, such as using a list comprehension with an if statement to filter out duplicates. 
    # For example: return [x for i, x in enumerate(l) if l.index(x) == i] 
    # This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) and a space complexity of O(n), because it uses the index method to find the position of each element in the list, which has a time complexity of O(n).  # noqa: E501
    # It's worth noting that this solution is less efficient than the previous solutions for large inputs, because it has a higher time complexity.  # noqa: E501
    # If you need to handle large inputs, you should use one of the previous solutions that has a lower time complexity.  # noqa: E501
    # In general, it's a good idea to use the most efficient solution that meets your requirements, and to test different solutions with different inputs to see which one is the most efficient.  # noqa: E501
    # It's also a good idea to consider the trade-offs between time complexity and space complexity, and to choose
