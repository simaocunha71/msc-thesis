The solution is to convert the list into a set, which automatically removes duplicates, and then convert it back into a list and sort it. Here is the Python code that does this:

```python
def unique(l: list):
    return sorted(set(l))
```

This function works by first converting the list into a set, which is an unordered collection of unique elements. Then it converts the set back into a list and sorts it. The result is a list of unique elements in sorted order. For example, if the input is `[5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]`, the output will be `[0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]`.  This is the desired behavior because the problem statement requires the output to be a sorted list of unique elements. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) because it involves sorting the list, where n is the number of elements in the list. The space complexity is O(n) because it involves storing the unique elements in a set and then in a list.  This solution assumes that the elements in the list are hashable, meaning they can be added to a set. If the elements are not hashable, a different approach would be needed.  For example, if the elements are lists, they are not hashable because lists are mutable and cannot be used as dictionary keys.  In this case, a different data structure, such as a dictionary, would need to be used to store the unique elements.  However, the basic approach of converting the list into a set and then back into a list would still be the same.  The details of how to implement this approach would depend on the specific requirements of the problem.  For example, if the input list is very large, it may be more efficient to use a different data structure, such as a Trie, to store the unique elements.  However, for most cases, the approach described in this solution should work well.  It is also worth noting that this solution assumes that the input list contains only elements that can be compared using the `==` operator.  If the input list contains elements that cannot be compared using the `==` operator, a different approach would be needed.  For example, if the input list contains strings and integers, a different comparison function would be needed to determine whether two elements are equal.  However, the basic approach of converting the list
