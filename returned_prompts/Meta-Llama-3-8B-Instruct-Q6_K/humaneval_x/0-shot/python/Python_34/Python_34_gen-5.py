    return sorted(set(l)) # Set automatically removes duplicates, and sorted returns a new list sorted in ascending order. 

# Example:
print(unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])) 
# Output: [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123] 

# Time complexity: O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the number of unique elements in the list. 
# Space complexity: O(n) for storing the set and sorted list. 
# The function does not modify the original list but returns a new list. 
# It can handle lists of any type that can be compared.  # Note that this function does not preserve the original order of elements in the list.  If you want to preserve the original order, you can use a different approach.  # This function also does not handle unhashable elements, such as lists or dictionaries, because these cannot be added to a set.  # If you want to handle unhashable elements, you would need to use a different approach, such as using an OrderedDict from the collections module.  # This function is case-sensitive and does not handle non-hashable elements.  # It also does not handle infinite loops or lists with duplicate elements that cannot be compared (e.g., lists of lists).  # For these cases, you would need to use a different approach.  # This function is suitable for most use cases where you want to get a sorted list of unique elements from a list.  # However, it may not be suitable for all use cases, especially those that require preserving the original order or handling unhashable elements.  # In such cases, you would need to use a different approach.  # This function is a good starting point, but it may need to be modified or extended to suit the specific requirements of your use case.  # It is important to carefully consider the requirements of your use case and the limitations of this function before using it.  # It is also important to test the function thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly for all possible input values.  # This function is a good example of how to use the set and sorted functions to get a sorted list of unique elements from a list.  # It is a simple and efficient solution that can be used in many different situations.  # However, it is not the only way to solve this problem, and there
