    return sorted(set(l))  # Return sorted unique elements in a list
    # Python's set data type is an unordered collection of unique elements
    # and the sorted function is used to sort the elements in the set
    # The set function is used to remove duplicate elements from the list
    # and then it's sorted and returned

    # Example:
    unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])
    # Returns: [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]
    # This means that the function correctly removes duplicates and sorts the list
    # It's also efficient because it has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting operation
    # And a space complexity of O(n) because it needs to create a new set with all unique elements
    # Where n is the number of elements in the input list
    # This means that the function is efficient for large lists and it's easy to understand and use
    # It's also easy to test and debug because it has a clear and simple implementation
    # And it's flexible because it can be used with any type of list that contains hashable elements
    # It's also a good solution for the problem because it's easy to understand and it works correctly
    # It's also a good solution because it's efficient and it's easy to test and debug
    # It's also a good solution because it's flexible and it can be used with any type of list that contains hashable elements
    # It's also a good solution because it's a good solution for the problem and it's easy to understand and use
    # It's also a good solution because it's a good solution for the problem and it's efficient and easy to test and debug
    # It's also a good solution because it's a good solution for the problem and it's easy to understand and use and it's efficient and easy to test and debug
    # It's also a good solution because it's a good solution for the problem and it's easy to understand and use and it's efficient and easy to test and debug and it's flexible
