```
def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    if not grid:
        return 0
    n = len(grid)
    m = len(grid[0])
    total_water = 0
    for i in range(n):
        total_water += sum(grid[i])
    total_buckets = math.ceil(total_water / capacity)
    return total_buckets
```
The solution is to calculate the total amount of water in the grid and then divide it by the bucket capacity. We use math.ceil() to round up to the nearest integer, because we can't have a fraction of a bucket. The number of buckets needed to empty the wells is the total number of buckets calculated in this way. 

For example, if the grid is [[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]] and the bucket capacity is 1, we have a total of 3 units of water. We would need 4 buckets to empty the wells, because each bucket can hold 1 unit of water, and we need 3 units of water. 

We use the sum() function to calculate the total amount of water in each row, and then sum up all the rows to get the total amount of water in the grid. 

Finally, we return the total number of buckets needed, which is the total number of buckets calculated in this way. 

The time complexity of this solution is O(n*m), where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns in the grid, because we need to iterate over each element in the grid once. The space complexity is O(1), because we only use a constant amount of space to store the total amount of water and the number of buckets. 

This solution is efficient and easy to understand, and it works for all the given constraints.
