Here is the Python solution for the problem:

```Python
def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    # Calculate total water in the grid
    total_water = sum(sum(row) for row in grid)
    
    # Calculate maximum number of times the bucket needs to be lowered
    max_lower = math.ceil(total_water / capacity)
    
    return max_lower
```

This function calculates the total amount of water in the grid by summing up the values in each row. Then, it calculates the maximum number of times the bucket needs to be lowered by dividing the total water by the bucket capacity and rounding up to the nearest integer using the `math.ceil` function.

The function returns the maximum number of times the bucket needs to be lowered.

For example, if the input grid is `[[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]]` and the bucket capacity is 1, the function will return 6, because the bucket needs to be lowered 6 times to empty all the wells. If the input grid is `[[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]]` and the bucket capacity is 2, the function will return 5, because the bucket needs to be lowered 5 times to empty all the wells. If the input grid is `[[0,0,0], [0,0,0]]` and the bucket capacity is 5, the function will return 0, because the wells are already empty.
