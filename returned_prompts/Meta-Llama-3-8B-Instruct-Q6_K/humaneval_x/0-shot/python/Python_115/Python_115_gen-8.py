The problem is asking to find the minimum number of times you need to lower the buckets to empty the wells. This can be achieved by iterating over the grid, filling the buckets and lowering them when they are full. We can also use the fact that the bucket capacity is a divisor of the length of the grid to optimize the process.

Here is a Python solution for the problem:

```Python
def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    n = len(grid)
    m = len(grid[0])
    total_water = 0
    for row in grid:
        total_water += sum(row)
    if total_water % capacity != 0:
        return -1
    total_fills = total_water // capacity
    return total_fills
```

This solution first calculates the total amount of water in the grid. Then it checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the bucket capacity. If it's not, it returns -1 because it's impossible to empty the wells with the given bucket capacity. If it is, it calculates the minimum number of times the buckets need to be lowered and returns that value. The time complexity of this solution is O(n*m) where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns in the grid. The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space.
