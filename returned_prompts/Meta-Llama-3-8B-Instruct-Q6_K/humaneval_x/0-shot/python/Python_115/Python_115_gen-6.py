This problem is a combination of water filling and bucket filling. We need to find the maximum number of times we need to lower the buckets to empty the wells. 

Here is a Python solution:

```
def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    water = 0
    total_water = 0
    for row in grid:
        water += sum(row)
        total_water += sum(row)
    return math.ceil(total_water / capacity) * capacity - water
```

In this solution, we first calculate the total amount of water in all the wells. Then we calculate how many times we need to lower the buckets to fill all the wells with water. We use the math.ceil function to round up to the nearest integer, because we can't have a fraction of a bucket. Finally, we subtract the total amount of water from the total amount of water we could hold in buckets to get the number of times we need to lower the buckets.  This is because we don't need to lower the buckets as many times as the total amount of water we could hold in buckets, because we can fill the buckets as many times as we need to.  This will give us the maximum number of times we need to lower the buckets.  We subtract the total amount of water because we don't need to lower the buckets for the water that is already in the buckets.  This will give us the minimum number of times we need to lower the buckets.  The math.ceil function ensures that we round up to the nearest integer, so we will always lower the buckets at least once, even if there is only one unit of water.  This is because we can't have a fraction of a bucket.  So, we will always lower the buckets at least once, even if there is only one unit of water.  This is because we can't have a fraction of a bucket.  We subtract the total amount of water because we don't need to lower the buckets for the water that is already in the buckets.
