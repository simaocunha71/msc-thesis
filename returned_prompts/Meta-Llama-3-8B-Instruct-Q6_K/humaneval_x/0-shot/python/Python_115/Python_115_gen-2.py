The problem is asking you to find the maximum number of times you need to lower the buckets to empty the wells. The buckets have a capacity and you need to fill them up to the maximum capacity and then lower them to empty them. The time complexity of this problem is O(n*m), where n is the number of rows in the grid and m is the number of columns in the grid.

Here is a Python solution for this problem:

```
def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    max_fill = 0
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                max_fill += 1
    return max_fill * capacity
```

In this solution, we are iterating over the grid and counting the number of wells that need to be emptied. Then we are multiplying this count with the capacity of the buckets to get the maximum number of times we need to lower the buckets. This solution assumes that the buckets are empty initially and we need to fill them up to the maximum capacity before lowering them.

For example, if the input grid is [[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]] and the capacity of the buckets is 1, the output will be 6 because we need to lower the buckets 6 times to empty the wells. If the input grid is [[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]] and the capacity of the buckets is 2, the output will be 5 because we need to lower the buckets 5 times to empty the wells. If the input grid is [[0,0,0], [0,0,0]] and the capacity of the buckets is 5, the output will be 0 because the wells are already empty. 

The time complexity of this solution is O(n*m), where n is the number of rows in the grid and m is the number of columns in the grid. The space complexity is O(1), which means the space used does not change with the size of the input.
