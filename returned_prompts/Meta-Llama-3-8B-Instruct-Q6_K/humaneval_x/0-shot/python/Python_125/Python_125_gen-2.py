1. `words = txt.split()`: This line tries to split the input string `txt` into a list of words based on whitespace.

2. `if not words`: This line checks if the `words` list is empty. If it is, it means that the input string did not contain any whitespace, so we need to try another way to split it.

3. `words = txt.replace(',', ' ').split()`: This line tries to split the input string `txt` into a list of words based on commas. It does this by replacing all commas with spaces, and then splitting the string on spaces.

4. `if not words`: This line checks if the `words` list is still empty. If it is, it means that the input string did not contain any whitespace or commas, so we need to count the number of lower-case letters with odd order in the
