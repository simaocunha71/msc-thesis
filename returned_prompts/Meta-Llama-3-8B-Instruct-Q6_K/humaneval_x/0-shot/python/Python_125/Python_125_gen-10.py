This function first tries to split the input string on whitespace using the `split` method. If no whitespace is found, it tries to split on commas using the `replace` method. If no commas are found, it counts the number of lowercase letters in the string that have an odd index (i.e., the first letter is 'a', the second letter is 'b', etc.). The `ord` function is used to get the ASCII value of a character, and the `%` operator is used to check if the index is odd. Finally, the function returns the list of words or the count of lowercase letters with odd index, depending on whether the input string was successfully split or not.
