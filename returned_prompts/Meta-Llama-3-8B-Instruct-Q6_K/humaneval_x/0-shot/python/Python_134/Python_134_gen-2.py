```
def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):
    if not txt:  # if the string is empty
        return False
    if txt[-1].isalpha():  # if the last character is an alphabetical character
        if txt[:-1].strip().endswith(' '):  # if the last character is not part of a word
            return True
    return False
```


Here's an explanation of the code:

1. `if not txt:`: This checks if the string is empty. If it is, the function immediately returns `False`.
2. `if txt[-1].isalpha():`: This checks if the last character of the string is an alphabetical character (either a letter or a number).
3. `if txt[:-1].strip().endswith(' '):`: This checks if the last character is not part of a word. It does this by stripping any leading or trailing whitespace from the string, and then checking if the resulting string ends with a space. If it does, the last character is not part of a word.

If the last character is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
