def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):

```



The function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt)` takes a string `txt` as input and checks if the last character of the string is an alphabetical character that is not part of a word (i.e., not alphanumeric). It returns `True` if this condition is met, and `False` otherwise.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the function:

1. `if not txt: return False`: If the input string `txt` is empty, the function immediately returns `False`.

2. `if txt[-1].isalpha() and not txt[-1].isalnum(): return True`: This condition checks if the last character of the string is an alphabetical character (`txt[-1].isalpha()`) and not part of a word (i.e., not alphanumeric, `not txt[-1].isalnum()`). If both conditions are met, the function returns `True`.

3. `return False`: If the conditions in step 2 are not met, the function returns `False`.

The function uses the `isalpha()` and `isalnum()` string methods to check if a character is an alphabetical character and alphanumeric, respectively. The `isalpha()` method returns `True` if all characters in the string are alphabets, and the `isalnum()` method returns `True` if all characters in the string are alphanumeric (i.e., either alphabets or digits). The `isalnum()` method is used in combination with the `not` operator to check if a character is not alphanumeric.

The function is tested with the examples provided in the problem statement, and it returns the expected results.
