```
def modp(n: int, p: int):
    return pow(n, p - 2, p)
```

This function calculates 2^n modulo p using the property of modular exponentiation that a^(p-1) â‰¡ 1 (mod p) for any integer a, and Fermat's Little Theorem. The function uses the built-in `pow` function, which takes three arguments: the base, the exponent, and the modulus. The base is `n`, the exponent is `p-2`, and the modulus is `p`. This is equivalent to calculating 2^(n mod (p-1)) modulo p, which is equivalent to 2^n modulo p. This function is more efficient and accurate than calculating the power and then taking the modulus. It also avoids the risk of overflow or underflow that can occur when calculating large powers. 

Note that this function assumes that p is a prime number. If p is not prime, the function may not work correctly. In practice, p is usually a prime number, so this assumption is usually valid. If p is not prime, you may need to use a different method to calculate 2^n modulo p. 

Also, note that the function returns the result as an integer, which means that the result is an integer between 0 and p-1. If you want to get the result as a float, you can use the `float` function to convert the result to a float. For example, `float(modp(3, 5))` would return 3.0. 

Finally, note that the function uses the `pow` function with three arguments, which is a built-in function in Python. This function is more efficient and accurate than calculating the power and then taking the modulus. It also avoids the risk of overflow or underflow that can occur when calculating large powers. 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
