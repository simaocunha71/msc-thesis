```python
import math

def modp(n: int, p: int):
    """Return 2^n modulo p (be aware of numerics)."""
    return pow(2, n, p)
```
This function uses Python's built-in `pow` function with three arguments: the base (2), the exponent (n), and the modulus (p). This is more efficient and accurate than calculating `2^n` and then taking the modulus. 

For example, `pow(2, 3, 5)` returns `8` which is `2^3` modulo `5`. This approach ensures that the calculation is done modulo `p` at each step, avoiding the need to perform a large calculation and then take the modulus, which can lead to loss of precision.

Note: The `pow` function with three arguments is available in Python 3.8 and later. In earlier versions of Python, you can use the `math.pow` function and then take the modulus, but this may lead to loss of precision. For example:
```python
def modp(n: int, p: int):
    """Return 2^n modulo p (be aware of numerics)."""
    return int(math.pow(2, n)) % p
```  However, this approach is less accurate and less efficient than the `pow` function with three arguments.
