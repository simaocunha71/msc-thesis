This function works by iterating through the array from both ends, comparing the left and right elements, and changing the one that is most different from the other elements in the array. It keeps track of the number of changes made and returns it at the end. The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the array, because it needs to iterate through the array once. The space complexity is O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the changes and the left and right indices.
