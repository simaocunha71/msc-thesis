The problem is asking to find the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array palindromic. A palindromic array is an array that is read the same backwards and forwards. 

Here is a Python solution for this problem:

```
def smallest_change(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    if n % 2 == 0:
        mid = n // 2
    else:
        mid = n // 2 + 1
    left = arr[:mid]
    right = arr[mid:][::-1]
    if left != right:
        diff = sum(el1 != el2 for el1, el2 in zip(left, right))
        return diff
    else:
        return 0
```

In this solution, we first find the middle of the array. If the array length is even, the middle is the half of the array length. If the array length is odd, the middle is the half of the array length plus one. 

Then we take the left half of the array and the reversed right half of the array. If the left half is not equal to the reversed right half, we calculate the difference between them. The difference is the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array palindromic. 

If the left half is equal to the reversed right half, it means the array is already palindromic, so we return 0. 

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the array. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space.
