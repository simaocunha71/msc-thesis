    for i in range(len(arr)):

        if arr[i] != rev_arr[i]:

```
Explanation:
The function `smallest_change` takes an array `arr` as input and returns the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array palindromic.

The function first reverses the array using slicing (`arr[::-1]`) and then iterates over the arrays using a for loop. For each position `i` in the arrays, it checks if the elements at that position are different. If they are, it increments the count of changes needed.

Finally, it returns the count of changes needed.

For example, if the input array is `[1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 9, 6]`, the function will return `4` because four elements need to be changed to make the array palindromic. If the input array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]`, the function will return `1` because one element needs to be changed to make the array palindromic. If the input array is `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`, the function will return `0` because the array is already palindromic.
