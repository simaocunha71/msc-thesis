```
def smallest_change(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    rev = arr[::-1]
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] != rev[i]:
            count += 1
    return count
```



Explanation:
This function takes an array of integers as input and returns the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array palindromic.

The function first reverses the array to create a new array `rev` that is the same as the original array but in reverse order.

Then it iterates over the original array and the reversed array simultaneously using a for loop. For each pair of elements, it checks if they are equal. If they are not equal, it increments a counter `count`.

Finally, it returns the value of `count`, which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array palindromic.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array, because it iterates over the array once. It also has a space complexity of O(n), because it creates a new array `rev` that is the same size as the input array.
