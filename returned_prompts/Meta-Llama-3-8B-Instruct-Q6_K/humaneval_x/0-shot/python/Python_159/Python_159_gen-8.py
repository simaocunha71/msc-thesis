```
def eat(number, need, remaining):
    total = number + min(need, remaining)
    return [total, remaining - (need - total)]
```



Explanation:

*   We first calculate the total number of carrots eaten by adding the initial number of carrots eaten (`number`) and the minimum of the required carrots (`need`) and the remaining carrots (`remaining`).
*   Then, we calculate the number of carrots left after the meals by subtracting the difference between the required carrots and the total number of carrots eaten (`need - total`) from the remaining carrots (`remaining`).
*   Finally, we return a list containing the total number of carrots eaten and the number of carrots left after the meals.

For example, if `eat(5, 6, 10)` is called, the function will return `[11, 4]`, which means that the rabbit has eaten a total of 11 carrots and there are 4 carrots left. If there are not enough remaining carrots, the rabbit will eat all the remaining carrots, but will still be hungry. For instance, if `eat(2, 11, 5)` is called, the function will return `[7, 0]`, indicating that the rabbit has eaten 7 carrots and there are no carrots left.
