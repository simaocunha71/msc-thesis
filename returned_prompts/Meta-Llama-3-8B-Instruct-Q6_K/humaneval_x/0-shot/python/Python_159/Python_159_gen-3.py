Explanation:
The function `eat` takes three parameters: `number`, `need`, and `remaining`. 
`number` is the number of carrots that you have eaten, `need` is the number of carrots that you need to eat, 
and `remaining` is the number of remaining carrots.

The function returns a list of two elements: the total number of carrots eaten after your meals, 
and the number of carrots left after your meals.

To calculate the total number of carrots eaten, we add the number of carrots you have already eaten (`number`) 
to the minimum of the number of carrots you still need to eat (`need - number`) and the number of remaining carrots (`remaining`).

To calculate the number of carrots left, we subtract the total number of carrots eaten from the number of remaining carrots, 
but only if the total number of carrots eaten is greater than the number of carrots you have already eaten. 
If not, we return the remaining carrots. 

This is because if there are not enough remaining carrots, you will eat all remaining carrots, 
but you will still be hungry, so you won't eat more than you need. 

For example, if you have eaten 5 carrots, you need 6 carrots, and there are 10 carrots remaining, 
you will eat 6 carrots (5 you already ate + 1 you still need to eat) and there will be 4 carrots left. 
If you have eaten 4 carrots, you need 8 carrots, and there are 9 carrots remaining, 
you will eat 12 carrots (4 you already ate + 8 you still need to eat) and there will be 1 carrot left. 
If you have eaten 1 carrot, you need 10 carrots, and there are 10 carrots remaining, 
you will eat 11 carrots (1 you already ate + 10 you still need to eat) and there will be 0 carrots left. 
If you have eaten 2 carrots, you need 11 carrots, and there are 5 carrots remaining, 
you will eat 7 carrots (2 you already ate + 5 you still need to eat) and there will be 0 carrots left.
