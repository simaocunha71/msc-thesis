#Explanation:
The function eat takes three parameters: the number of carrots already eaten, the number of carrots needed, and the number of remaining carrots. It calculates the total number of carrots eaten after meals and the number of carrots left after meals. If there are not enough remaining carrots, it eats all remaining carrots but still remains hungry. The function returns a list of two elements: the total number of carrots eaten and the number of carrots left.

#Solution:
def eat(number, need, remaining):
    eaten = number + (remaining if remaining >= need - number else need - number)
    left = remaining - (need - number) if remaining >= need - number else 0
    return [eaten, left]

The function works by first calculating the total number of carrots eaten. If there are enough remaining carrots to meet the need, it eats the remaining carrots. Otherwise, it eats the remaining carrots and still remains hungry. The number of carrots left is then calculated by subtracting the number of carrots eaten from the total number of carrots remaining. If there are not enough remaining carrots to meet the need, the number of carrots left is set to 0. The function returns a list of two elements: the total number of carrots eaten and the number of carrots left.
