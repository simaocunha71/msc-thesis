Here is the Python function `eat` that takes three parameters: `number`, `need`, and `remaining`. The function calculates the total number of eaten carrots and the number of carrots left after the rabbit's meals.

Here's a breakdown of how the function works:

1. Calculate the total number of eaten carrots by adding the number of carrots already eaten (`number`) to the minimum of the remaining carrots (`remaining`) and the number of carrots needed (`need`).
2. Calculate the number of carrots left by subtracting the difference between the number of carrots needed (`need`) and the number of carrots already eaten (`number`) from the remaining carrots (`remaining`).
3. If the number of carrots left is negative, set it to 0, as the rabbit cannot eat negative carrots.
4. Return the total number of eaten carrots and the number of carrots left as a list.

The function is designed to handle the constraints specified in the problem, ensuring that the output is within the range of 0 to 1000 for each parameter.

You can test the function with the examples provided to verify its correctness. For instance, `eat(5, 6, 10)` should return `[11, 4]`, and `eat(1, 10, 10)` should return `[11, 0]`.
