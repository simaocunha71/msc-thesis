def eat(number, need, remaining):
    total = number + min(need, remaining)
    remaining -= min(need, remaining)
    return [total, remaining]

# testing the function
print(eat(5, 6, 10))  # [11, 4]
print(eat(4, 8, 9))   # [12, 1]
print(eat(1, 10, 10)) # [11, 0]
print(eat(2, 11, 5))  # [7, 0]




# Explanation:
# - The function `eat(number, need, remaining)` takes three parameters: 
#   the number of carrots that you have eaten, the number of carrots that you need to eat, 
#   and the number of remaining carrots in stock.
# - The function calculates the total number of carrots eaten by adding the number of carrots eaten initially to the minimum of the number of carrots needed and the remaining carrots.
# - The function then subtracts the minimum of the number of carrots needed and the remaining carrots from the remaining carrots to get the remaining carrots after the meals.
# - The function returns a list containing the total number of carrots eaten and the remaining carrots after the meals.
# - The function ensures that the total number of carrots eaten does not exceed the remaining carrots in stock, and that the remaining carrots after the meals are not negative.
