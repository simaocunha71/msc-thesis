The function `search(lst)` takes a list of positive integers as input and returns the greatest integer that is greater than zero and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself. If no such value exists, it returns -1.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the function:

1. Create an empty dictionary `frequency_dict` to store the frequency of each integer in the list.
2. Iterate over the list and update the frequency dictionary. For each integer, if it already exists in the dictionary, increment its frequency by 1; otherwise, set its frequency to 1.
3. Iterate over the frequency dictionary and check each integer. If an integer is greater than zero and its frequency is greater than or equal to its value, return that integer.
4. If no such integer is found, return -1.

Here's the code:
```
def search(lst):
    frequency_dict = {}
    for num in lst:
        if num in frequency_dict:
            frequency_dict[num] += 1
        else:
            frequency_dict[num] = 1
    for num, freq in frequency_dict.items():
        if num > 0 and freq >= num:
            return num
    return -1
```
This function works by iterating over the list and creating a frequency dictionary, then iterating over the dictionary to find the desired integer. If no such integer exists, it returns -1. The function is efficient because it uses a dictionary to store the frequency of each integer, which allows it to look up the frequency of each integer in constant time. The time complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the length of the input list. The space complexity is O(n) as well, because the function uses a dictionary to store the frequency of each integer.
