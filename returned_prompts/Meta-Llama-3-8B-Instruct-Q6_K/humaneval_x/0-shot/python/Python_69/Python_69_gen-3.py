The function `search(lst)` takes a list of positive integers as input and returns the greatest integer that is greater than zero and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself. If no such integer exists, it returns -1.

Here is the step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Create an empty dictionary `frequency_dict` to store the frequency of each integer in the list.
2. Iterate through the list, and for each integer, increment its frequency in the dictionary.
3. Initialize a variable `max_num` to -1.
4. Iterate through the dictionary, and for each integer `num` and its frequency `freq`, check if the frequency is greater than or equal to the integer itself and the integer is greater than zero. If this condition is met, update `max_num` to the current integer.
5. Return `max_num` as the result.

Here is the code:
```
def search(lst):
    frequency_dict = {}
    for num in lst:
        if num in frequency_dict:
            frequency_dict[num] += 1
        else:
            frequency_dict[num] = 1
    max_num = -1
    for num, freq in frequency_dict.items():
        if freq >= num and num > 0 and num > max_num:
            max_num = num
    return max_num
```
This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list, because it iterates through the list once to build the frequency dictionary and then iterates through the dictionary once to find the maximum integer. The space complexity is O(n) as well, because in the worst case, the frequency dictionary could contain n unique integers.
