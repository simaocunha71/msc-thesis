The function works by first creating a dictionary where the keys are the numbers in the list and the values are their frequencies. Then it iterates over the dictionary, keeping track of the maximum number that has a frequency greater than or equal to its value and is greater than 0. If no such number is found, the function returns -1. 

The function correctly handles the edge cases where the list contains duplicate numbers and where there are no numbers that meet the criteria. It also handles the case where the list only contains one number, in which case the function returns that number. 

The function's time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list, because it makes one pass over the list to create the dictionary and one pass over the dictionary to find the maximum number. The space complexity is also O(n), because in the worst case the dictionary will contain all the numbers in the list.
