    # This function first replaces all the spaces in the string with commas, and then splits the string at the commas, resulting in a list of words.  The replace function replaces all occurrences of a substring within a string, in this case, the space character.  The split function splits a string into a list of substrings, in this case, the list of words.  The commas are used as the delimiter to split the string.  The result is a list of words.  # 
    # 
    # For example, if the input string is "Hi, my name is John", the function will first replace all the spaces with commas, resulting in "Hi,my,name,is,John".  Then it will split this string at the commas, resulting in the list ["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "John"].  This is the desired output.  # 
    # 
    # This function can handle strings that contain multiple spaces or commas, as long as they are separated by either a space or a comma.  For example, the input string "Hi, my  name is John" will result in the same output as "Hi, my name is John".  # 
    # 
    # This function can also handle strings that contain commas or spaces at the beginning or end.  For example, the input string "Hi, my name is John," will result in the same output as "Hi, my name is John".  # 
    # 
    # This function is case-sensitive, so it will treat "Hi" and "hi" as different words.  If you want to make it case-insensitive, you can convert the string to lower case or upper case before splitting it.  # 
    # 
    # This function is also capable of handling strings that contain punctuation marks.  For example, the input string "Hi, my name is John!" will result in the same output as "Hi, my name is John".  #
