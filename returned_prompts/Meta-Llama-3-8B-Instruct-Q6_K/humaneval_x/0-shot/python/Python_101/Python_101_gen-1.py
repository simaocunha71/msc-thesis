This Python function takes a string of words separated by commas or spaces, splits the string into words, and returns a list of the words. Here's the breakdown of how it works:

1. `s.replace(",", " ")`: This line replaces all commas (",") in the input string with spaces (" "). This is done to ensure that the words are separated by spaces, which is how the `split()` function works.

2. `s.split()`: This line splits the string into a list of words based on the spaces. The `split()` function without any arguments splits the string at each space.

3. `[word.strip() for word in ...]`: This line uses a list comprehension to create a new list with each word from the original list. The `strip()` function is used to remove any leading or trailing spaces from each word.

Here's an example of how this function would work:

```
print(words_string("Hi, my name is John"))
# Output: ["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "John"]
```

This function should work for any string of words separated by commas or spaces. It's a simple and effective way to split a string into a list of words.
