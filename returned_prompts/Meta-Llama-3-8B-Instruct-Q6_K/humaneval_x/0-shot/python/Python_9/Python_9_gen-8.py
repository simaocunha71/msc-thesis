    # Here, we're using list comprehension to generate the list of rolling maximums. 
    # We're iterating over the indices of the input list, and for each index, 
    # we're finding the maximum value up to that index using list slicing and the max function.
    # This gives us the rolling maximum at each step. 
    # The result is a list of rolling maximums, which we return. 
    # The example input [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2] should give us the output [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4], 
    # as expected. 
    # This function has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the max function, 
    # where n is the length of the input list. 
    # This could be optimized to O(n) if we were to use a different data structure, 
    # such as a heap or a sorted list, to keep track of the rolling maximums. 
    # However, the current implementation is simple and easy to understand. 
    # It may be sufficient for small input lists, and it could be a good starting point for further optimization. 
    # The docstring includes a unit test to help verify the function's correctness. 
    # This function is designed to work with lists of integers, 
    # but it could be modified to work with other types of sequences or data structures. 
    # It's a good exercise to try to generalize this function to work with other types of data. 
    # This could involve using type hints to specify the types of input and output, 
    # or using a more flexible data structure to store the rolling maximums. 
    # The possibilities are endless! 
    # Happy coding!
