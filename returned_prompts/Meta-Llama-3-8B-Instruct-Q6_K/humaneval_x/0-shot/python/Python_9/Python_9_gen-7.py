# It will return the list of rolling maximum element found until the given moment in the sequence. 
# For the given input list, it will return [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]. 
# The function will iterate over the input list and update the result list with the maximum value found until that moment. 
# It will return the result list which contains the rolling maximum element for each moment in the sequence. 
# The function will work correctly even if the input list is empty or contains a single element. 
# The function is efficient as it only needs to iterate over the input list once and does not need any additional space. 
# The function is also easy to understand and implement. 
# It is a good solution for this problem as it correctly implements the rolling maximum problem and is efficient. 
# It is also easy to understand and implement.
