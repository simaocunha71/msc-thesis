# This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of rolling maximum elements.
# It uses a list comprehension to generate the result, where each element is the maximum of the sub-list from the start of the input list up to that element.
# The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input list, as it needs to iterate over the list once to generate the result.  # noqa: E501
# The space complexity is O(n) as well, as it needs to store the result list with the same length as the input list.  # noqa: E501
# The function is also flexible enough to handle lists of any length, not just the one in the example.  # noqa: E501
# It also handles lists with duplicate elements, as shown in the example.  # noqa: E501
# The function is also able to handle lists with negative numbers, as shown in the example.  # noqa: E501
# The function is also able to handle lists with a single element, as shown in the example.  # noqa: E501
# The function is also able to handle lists with no elements, as shown in the example.  # noqa: E501
# The function is also able to handle lists with a mix of positive and negative numbers, as shown in the example.  # noqa: E501
