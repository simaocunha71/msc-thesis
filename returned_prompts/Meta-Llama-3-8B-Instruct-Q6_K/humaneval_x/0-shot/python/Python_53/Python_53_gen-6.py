def add(x: int, y: int):
    return x + y


In this problem, we are asked to write a function called `add` that takes two integers `x` and `y` as input and returns their sum.

The function is defined as follows:

```
def add(x: int, y: int):
    return x + y
```

The type hints `x: int` and `y: int` indicate that the function takes two integers as input. The function returns the sum of `x` and `y` using the `+` operator.

The docstring provides examples of how the function should behave, such as `add(2, 3)` returning `5` and `add(5, 7)` returning `12`. These examples can be used to test the function to ensure it is working correctly.
