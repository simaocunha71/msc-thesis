```
def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    return x + y
```

The function `add(x: int, y: int)` takes two integer arguments `x` and `y` and returns their sum. The function signature includes type hints for `x` and `y` as integers, and the return type is also specified as an integer.

The docstring includes two doctests that demonstrate the function's behavior. The first test case checks that `add(2, 3)` returns `5`, and the second test case checks that `add(5, 7)` returns `12`. These doctests can be used to verify that the function behaves correctly.
