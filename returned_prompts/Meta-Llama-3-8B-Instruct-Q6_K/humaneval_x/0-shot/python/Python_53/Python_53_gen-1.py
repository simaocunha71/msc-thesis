    # The function add takes two parameters x and y both of type int
    # It returns the sum of these two numbers

    # The function is simple and easy to understand
    # It does not handle any exceptions, it will raise an error if the inputs are not integers
    # The function is not very scalable, it can only add two numbers at a time
    # The function is not very flexible, it can only add two numbers
    # The function does not have any side effects, it does not modify any external state
    # The function is deterministic, it will always return the same result for the same inputs
    # The function is not very efficient, it does not use any caching or memoization
    # The function is not very readable, it does not have any comments or documentation
    # The function is not very maintainable, it does not have any tests or validation
    # The function is not very reusable, it can only be used to add two numbers
