This function checks if a given number `n` is prime or not. It returns `True` if `n` is prime and `False` otherwise. The function uses the following logic:

1. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it is not prime, so return `False`.
2. If `n` is less than or equal to 3, it is prime, so return `True`.
3. If `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, it is not prime, so return `False`.
4. Check if `n` is divisible by any odd number up to its square root. If it is, it is not prime, so return `False`.
5. If `n` is not divisible by any of the above, it is prime, so return `True`. 6. This function is efficient because it only checks divisibility up to the square root of `n`. 7. The function uses the property that all primes are of the form 6k Â± 1, with the exception of 2 and 3. This is why it checks divisibility by `i` and `i + 2` in the loop. 8. The function is also optimized for small numbers by returning `False` for `n` less than or equal to 1 and `True` for `n` less than or equal to 3. 9. The function is also optimized for large numbers by only checking divisibility up to the square root of `n`. 10. The function is tested with a variety of inputs to ensure it works correctly. 11. The function is well-documented with a clear description of what it does and examples of how to use it. 12. The function is also tested with edge cases such as `n = 1` and `n = 2` to ensure it works correctly for these inputs. 13. The function is also tested with large numbers to ensure it works correctly for these inputs. 14
