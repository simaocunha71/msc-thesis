def incr_list(l: list):
    return [i + 1 for i in l]
    # Or, more verbosely:
    # result = []
    # for i in l:
    #     result.append(i + 1)
    # return result
    # Or, even more verbosely:
    # result = []
    # i = 0
    # for i in l:
    #     result.append(i + 1)
    # return result
    # But you get the idea. The function takes a list of integers, and returns a new list with each element incremented by 1. The code can be written in many ways, but this is probably the most concise and readable way. The list comprehension is a very powerful and expressive feature of Python. It allows you to create a new list by performing an operation on each element of an existing list. In this case, the operation is simply adding 1 to each element. The result is a new list with the same length as the original, but with each element incremented by 1.
