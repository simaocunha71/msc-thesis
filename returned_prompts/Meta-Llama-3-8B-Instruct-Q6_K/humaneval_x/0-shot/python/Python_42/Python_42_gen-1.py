    return [i + 1 for i in l]  # Using list comprehension
    # Alternative solution
    # result = []
    # for i in l:
    #     result.append(i + 1)
    # return result  # Using for loop and append method
    # This function takes a list of numbers as input, and returns a new list where each element is incremented by 1. It uses list comprehension to achieve this. The list comprehension iterates over each element in the input list, adds 1 to it, and creates a new list with the results. This is a concise and efficient way to solve this problem.
