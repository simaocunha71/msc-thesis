```



Explanation:
The function `incr_list` takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list where each element is incremented by 1. This is achieved using a list comprehension, which is a concise way to create a new list from an existing list. The expression `i+1` is used to increment each element `i` in the input list, and the resulting values are collected into a new list. The function is tested with two examples, one with a small list and another with a larger list, to demonstrate its correctness. 

For example, when called with the list `[1, 2, 3]`, the function returns the list `[2, 3, 4]`, which is the result of incrementing each element by 1. Similarly, when called with the list `[5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]`, the function returns the list `[6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]`, which is the result of incrementing each element by 1. 

The function is designed to be flexible and can handle lists of any length, as well as lists containing elements of any type (not just integers). The function does not modify the original list but returns a new list with the incremented elements. This is because Python is pass-by-object-reference, which means that when a function is called, it receives a copy of the reference to the original list, not the original list itself. Therefore, modifying the list within the function does not affect the original list. 

The function is also designed to be efficient, as it uses a list comprehension to create the new list. List comprehensions are generally faster than using a for loop to create a new list. 

The function is tested using the `>>>` syntax, which is a way to test code in Python. The code is executed and the output is displayed. In this case, the output is the result of calling the `incr_list` function with the specified input list. 

The function is also documented using docstrings, which are a way to document functions in Python. The docstring provides a brief description of the function, its parameters, and its return value. This is helpful for other developers who may need to use the function, as it provides a clear
