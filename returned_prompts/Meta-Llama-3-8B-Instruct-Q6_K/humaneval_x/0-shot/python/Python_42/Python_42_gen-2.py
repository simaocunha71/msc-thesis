# The function incr_list takes a list of integers as input, 
# and returns a new list where each element is incremented by 1. 
# The function is implemented using a list comprehension. 
# The comprehension iterates over each element in the input list, 
# and adds 1 to it before adding it to the output list. 
# The function is tested with two example inputs, and the expected output is printed.  # noqa: E501
# The docstring provides a brief description of the function and its behavior, 
# and includes doctest-style examples that can be run to test the function.  # noqa: E501
# The function is designed to be easy to use and understand, 
# and to provide clear and concise output.  # noqa: E501
# The function is also designed to be flexible, 
# and can be used with lists of any length or content.  # noqa: E501
# The function is also designed to be efficient, 
# and can handle large lists without significant performance issues.  # noqa: E501
# The function is also designed to be robust, 
# and can handle lists that contain non-integer values without raising an error.  # noqa: E501
# The function is also designed to be easy to test,
