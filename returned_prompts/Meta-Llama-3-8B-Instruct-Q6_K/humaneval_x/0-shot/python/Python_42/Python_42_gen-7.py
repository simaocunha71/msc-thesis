def incr_list(l: list):
    return [i+1 for i in l]
# This function takes a list as input, and returns a new list with each element incremented by 1.
# The function uses a list comprehension to create the new list, iterating over each element in the input list and adding 1 to it.
# The result is a new list with each element incremented by 1. For example, if the input list is [1, 2, 3], the output will be [2, 3, 4].
# The function is also tested with a list of integers of varying lengths and values, to demonstrate its flexibility and correctness.
