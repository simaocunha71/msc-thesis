Explanation:
The function `multiply(a, b)` takes two integers `a` and `b` as arguments. It returns the product of the unit digits of `a` and `b`. The unit digit of a number is the remainder when the number is divided by 10. This is achieved by using the modulus operator `%` with 10 as the divisor. The function then multiplies the unit digits together and returns the result. This function assumes that the input is always valid, i.e., `a` and `b` are integers. If this is not the case, the function may not work correctly. 

For example, if `a = 148` and `b = 412`, the unit digits of `a` and `b` are `8` and `2` respectively. The product of these digits is `8 * 2 = 16`, which is the result returned by the function. Similarly, if `a = 19` and `b = 28`, the unit digits of `a` and `b` are `9` and `8` respectively. The product of these digits is `9 * 8 = 72`, which is the result returned by the function. If `a = 2020` and `b = 1851`, the unit digits of `a` and `b` are `0` and `1` respectively. The product of these digits is `0 * 1 = 0`, which is the result returned by the function. If `a = 14` and `b = -15`, the unit digits of `a` and `b` are `4` and `5` respectively. The product of these digits is `4 * 5 = 20`, which is the result returned by the function. 

In all these cases, the function correctly returns the product of the unit digits of `a` and `b`.  However, it is important to note that the function does not handle cases where `a` or `b` are not integers. If this is a possibility, the function should be modified to handle these cases.  For example, it could raise an exception if `a` or `b` is not an integer.  It is also worth noting that the function does not handle cases where `a` or `b` is negative. If this is a possibility
