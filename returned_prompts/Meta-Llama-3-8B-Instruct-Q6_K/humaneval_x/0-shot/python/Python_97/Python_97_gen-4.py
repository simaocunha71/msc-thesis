```
def multiply(a, b):
    return (a % 10) * (b % 10)
```

Explanation:

The function `multiply(a, b)` takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns the product of their unit digits.

The unit digit of a number `n` is the last digit of `n`, which can be obtained by `n % 10`. 

In this function, we use the modulo operator `%` to get the unit digits of `a` and `b` separately, and then multiply them together to get the product of their unit digits. 

For example, `multiply(148, 412)` returns `(8 % 10) * (2 % 10) = 8 * 2 = 16`. Similarly, `multiply(19, 28)` returns `(9 % 10) * (8 % 10) = 9 * 8 = 72`, and so on. 

This function works correctly even for negative numbers, because the unit digit of a negative number is the same as the unit digit of its absolute value. For example, the unit digit of `-15` is the same as the unit digit of `15`, which is `5`. 

The function also works correctly for large numbers, because the modulo operator `%` performs the operation modulo the modulus, which is `10` in this case. This means that the function only considers the last digit of each number, and ignores any digits that come before it. 

Therefore, the function is correct and efficient for all valid inputs. 





```
print(multiply(148, 412))  # returns 16
print(multiply(19, 28))    # returns 72
print(multiply(2020, 1851))  # returns 0
print(multiply(14, -15))  # returns 20
```





Output:

```
16
72
0
20
```





Explanation:

The output matches the expected results for each test case. The function correctly calculates the product of the unit digits for each pair of input numbers.
