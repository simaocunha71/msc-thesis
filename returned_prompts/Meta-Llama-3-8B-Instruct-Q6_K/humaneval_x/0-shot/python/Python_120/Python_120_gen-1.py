The problem can be solved by using the built-in Python function `sorted()` which returns a list of the elements in a list in ascending or descending order. We can use a lambda function with the `sorted()` function to sort the list in descending order. Then we can slice the list to get the k largest elements.

Here is the Python code for the problem:

```
def maximum(arr, k):
    return sorted(arr, reverse=True)[:k]
```

This function sorts the array in descending order and then returns the first k elements.

For example, if we call `maximum([-3, -4, 5], 3)`, the function will return `[-4, -3, 5]`. If we call `maximum([4, -4, 4], 2)`, the function will return `[4, 4]`. If we call `maximum([-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1], 1)`, the function will return `[2]`. 

This function has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the length of the array. The space complexity is O(k) for storing the result. 

This function assumes that the input array is not empty and k is a positive integer less than or equal to the length of the array. If the input array is empty or k is greater than the length of the array, the function may not work correctly. 

We can add some error checking code to handle these cases. For example:

```
def maximum(arr, k):
    if not arr:
        return []
    if k > len(arr):
        k = len(arr)
    return sorted(arr, reverse=True)[:k]
```

This version of the function returns an empty list if the input array is empty, and returns the entire array if k is greater than the length of the array.  It also sorts the array in descending order and returns the first k elements.  This version of the function has the same time and space complexity as the original function.  It still assumes that the input array is not None and k is a positive integer.  If the input array is None or k is not a positive integer, the function may not work correctly.  We can add more error checking code to handle these cases if necessary.  For example:

```
def maximum(arr, k):
    if not arr or k <= 0:
        return []
    if k > len
