```
def maximum(arr, k):
    arr.sort(reverse=True)
    return arr[:k]
```



The provided function `maximum` takes an array `arr` and an integer `k` as input. It sorts the array in descending order and then returns a slice of the sorted array up to the length `k`.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. `arr.sort(reverse=True)`: This line sorts the array `arr` in descending order. The `reverse=True` argument tells the `sort` method to sort in reverse order (i.e., from largest to smallest).

2. `return arr[:k]`: This line returns a slice of the sorted array `arr` up to the length `k`. The `[:k]` syntax creates a slice that starts at the beginning of the array and ends at the `k`-th element.

For example, if `arr = [-3, -4, 5]` and `k = 3`, the function will sort the array in descending order as `[-4, -3, 5]`, and then return the first 3 elements, which are `[-4, -3, 5]`.

If `arr = [4, -4, 4]` and `k = 2`, the function will sort the array in descending order as `[4, 4, -4]`, and then return the first 2 elements, which are `[4, 4]`.

If `arr = [-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1]` and `k = 1`, the function will sort the array in descending order as `[2, 2, 1, 1, -1, -2, -3]`, and then return the first 1 element, which is `2`.
