The solution for this problem can be achieved by using a list comprehension and the built-in functions pow() and sum(). Here is the Python code for the problem:

```Python
def sum_squares(lst):
    return sum([pow(i, 2) if i % 3 == 0 else pow(i, 3) if i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0 else i for i in lst])
```
This code works by iterating over each element in the list, checking its index to see if it is a multiple of 3 or 4, and then applying the appropriate operation (squared or cubed) to the element. The results are then summed up and returned. 

For example, for the input lst = [1,2,3], the function will return 6, which is the sum of 1^2 + 2 + 3^2. For the input lst = [], the function will return 0, since the sum of an empty list is 0. For the input lst = [-1,-5,2,-1,-5], the function will return -126, which is the sum of (-1)^2 + (-5)^3 + 2 + (-1)^2 + (-5)^3.
