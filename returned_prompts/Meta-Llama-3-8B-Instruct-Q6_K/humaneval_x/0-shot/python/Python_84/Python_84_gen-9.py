Explanation:

The function `solve(N)` takes an integer `N` as input and returns the sum of its digits in binary as a string.

First, it converts the integer `N` to binary using the `bin()` function and removes the '0b' prefix using slicing (`[2:]`).

Then, it initializes a variable `sum_digits` to 0 and iterates over each character in the binary string. For each character, it adds the integer value of the character (0 or 1) to `sum_digits`.

After that, it converts `sum_digits` to binary using the `bin()` function again and removes the '0b' prefix using slicing (`[2:]`).

Finally, it returns the sum in binary as a string.

The test cases at the end demonstrate the function's output for different inputs. For example, `solve(1000)` returns the string "1" because the sum of the digits of 1000 in binary is 1, `solve(150)` returns the string "110" because the sum of the digits of 150 in binary is 6, and `solve(147)` returns the string "1100" because the sum of the digits of 147 in binary is 12.
