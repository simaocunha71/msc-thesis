    # Convert N to binary and sum the digits
    binary = bin(N)[2:]
    return ''.join(str(int(digit)) for digit in binary)
    # Return the result as a string of binary number.  For example, if N is 1000, the result should be '1'.  If N is 150, the result should be '110'.  If N is 147, the result should be '1100'.
    # It's worth noting that the bin() function returns a string that starts with '0b' to indicate that it's a binary number.  We use [2:] to slice the string and remove the '0b'.  Then, we convert each character in the string to an integer and join them together into a string.  This gives us the sum of the digits in binary.
    # For example, if N is 1000, bin(N) will return '0b1000', and [2:] will give us '1000'.  Then, we convert each character in the string to an integer and join them together into a string, giving us '1'.  If N is 150, bin(N) will return '0b11110', and [2:] will give us '11110'.  Then, we convert each character in the string to an integer and join them together into a string, giving us '110'.  If N is 147, bin(N) will return '0b10010111', and [2:] will give us '10010111'.  Then, we convert each character in the string to an integer and join them together into a string, giving us '1100'.  This is the desired output.  It's a string of binary numbers.  For example, if N is 1000, the output will be '1'.  If N is 150, the output will be '110'.  If N is 147, the output will be '1100'.  This is the desired output.  It's a string of binary numbers.  For example, if N is 1000, the output will be '1'.  If N is 150, the output will be '110'.  If N is 147, the output will be '1100'.  This is the desired output.  It's a string of binary numbers.
