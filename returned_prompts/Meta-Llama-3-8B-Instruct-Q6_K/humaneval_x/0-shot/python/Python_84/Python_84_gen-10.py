The function `solve(N)` takes an integer `N` as input and returns the total sum of its digits in binary as a string.

Here's how the function works:

1. It converts the input `N` to a binary string using the `bin()` function, and removes the '0b' prefix using string slicing (`[2:]`).
2. It initializes a variable `total_sum` to 0, which will store the sum of the digits.
3. It iterates over each character (digit) in the binary string using a for loop.
4. For each digit, it converts the character to an integer using the `int()` function and adds it to the `total_sum`.
5. Finally, it returns the `total_sum` as a string using the `str()` function.

The test cases demonstrate the correct output for different inputs. For example, for `N = 1000`, the function returns the string "1", which is the sum of the digits in the binary representation of 1000 (which is 1111101000 in binary). Similarly, for `N = 150`, the function returns the string "6", which is the sum of the digits in the binary representation of 150 (which is 11101110 in binary).
