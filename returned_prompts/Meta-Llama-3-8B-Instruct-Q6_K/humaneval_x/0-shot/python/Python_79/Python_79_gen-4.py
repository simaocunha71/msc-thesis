def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    return "db" + bin(decimal)[2:] + "db"
# The bin() function returns a string that starts with '0b' to indicate binary.
# [2:] is used to remove the '0b' from the beginning of the string.
# The "db" and "db" are added to the beginning and end of the string to match the problem's requirements. 
# For example, decimal_to_binary(15) returns "db1111db". 
# The function is able to handle any positive integer as input. 
# The function returns a string of '0' and '1' characters, with each character representing a binary number. 
# The string also includes the extra characters 'db' at the beginning and at the end of the string. 
# This is to match the problem's requirements.  # The function works by first converting the decimal number into a binary string with the bin() function. 
# Then, it removes the '0b' from the beginning of the string with [2:]. 
# Finally, it adds the 'db' characters to the beginning and end of the string. 
# The result is a binary string with the 'db' characters added. 
# This matches the problem's requirements. 
# The function can be used to convert any positive integer into a binary string with 'db' characters added. 
# For example, decimal_to_binary(15) returns "db1111db". 
# The function works as expected.
