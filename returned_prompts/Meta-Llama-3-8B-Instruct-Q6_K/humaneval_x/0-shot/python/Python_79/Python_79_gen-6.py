    def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
        return "db" + bin(decimal)[2:] + "db"
    # The bin() function is used to convert a decimal number to a binary number.
    # The [2:] is used to remove the '0b' that is added at the beginning of the binary string. 
    # This function will return a string with 'db' at the beginning and at the end, and the binary representation in between. 
    print(decimal_to_binary(15))  # Output: db1111db
    print(decimal_to_binary(32))  # Output: db100000db
    print(decimal_to_binary(255)) # Output: db11111111db

    # The bin() function works with integers and returns a string that starts with '0b' and then contains the binary representation of the number. 
    # For example, bin(15) will return '0b1111'. 
    # The [2:] is used to remove the '0b' from the beginning of the string. 
    # For example, bin(15)[2:] will return '1111'. 
    # So the function decimal_to_binary(15) will return "db1111db". 
    # The same applies to decimal_to_binary(32) and decimal_to_binary(255). 
    # This function works correctly for any positive integer. 
    # It will not work correctly for non-integer values, for negative integers, or for integers that are too large to be represented as a binary number. 
    # It will also not work correctly if the input is not an integer. 
    # It is a good idea to add error checking code to handle these cases. 
    # For example, you could check if the input is an integer before trying to convert it to binary. 
    # You could also check if the input is a positive number before trying to convert it to binary. 
    # You could also check if the input is a number that can be represented as a binary number before trying to convert it to binary. 
    # These are just a few examples of the kind of error checking code you could add. 
    # The specific error checking code you add will depend on the specific requirements of your function. 
    # In general, it is a good idea to add error checking code to any function that will be used by other parts of your program. 
    # This will help to ensure that your function works correctly
