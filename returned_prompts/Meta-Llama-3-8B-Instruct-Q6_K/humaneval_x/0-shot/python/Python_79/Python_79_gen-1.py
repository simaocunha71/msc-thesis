The code defines a function `decimal_to_binary` that takes a decimal number as input and returns the binary representation of that number as a string.

Here's how it works:

1. `bin(decimal)[2:]` converts the decimal number to a binary string using the built-in `bin` function. The `[2:]` is used to remove the '0b' prefix that `bin` adds to the output.
2. The resulting binary string is then padded with leading zeros to make it a multiple of 8 bits (1 byte) long. This is done using `"0" * (8 - len(binary))`.
3. The padded binary string is then concatenated with the extra characters 'db' at the beginning and end of the string using `"db" + ... + "db"`.

Here's an example of how this function works:

```
decimal_to_binary(15)
# Returns: "db1111db"
```

This function works for decimal numbers up to 2^31-1, which is the maximum value that can be represented by a 32-bit signed integer in most programming languages. If you need to handle larger numbers, you may need to use a different approach.
