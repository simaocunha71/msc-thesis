B:

```
def digits(n):
    product = 1
    for digit in str(n):
        if int(digit) % 2 != 0:
            product *= int(digit)
    return product
```


C:

```
def digits(n):
    product = 1
    for digit in str(n):
        if int(digit) % 2 != 0:
            product *= int(digit)
    return product
```


D:

```
def digits(n):
    product = 1
    for digit in str(n):
        if int(digit) % 2 != 0:
            product *= int(digit)
    return product
```


Explanation:

The solution is a simple loop that iterates over each digit in the input number. For each digit, it checks if it's odd by using the modulus operator (`%`). If the digit is odd, it multiplies the product by that digit. If all digits are even, the product will remain 1. At the end of the loop, the function returns the product.

This solution has a time complexity of O(log n) because it needs to iterate over each digit in the input number, and the number of digits is proportional to the logarithm of the number. The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the product and the current digit.
