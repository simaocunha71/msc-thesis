    return [(x - min(numbers)) / (max(numbers) - min(numbers)) for x in numbers]
    # The formula is: (x - min) / (max - min), it will shift the range of the numbers so that the smallest becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1.
    # This is a linear transformation, which is why it's often used for rescaling. It's also known as the "min-max" scaling.
    # The list comprehension is used to apply this transformation to each element in the input list. 

    # For example, if the input list is [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0], 
    # the min will be 1.0, the max will be 5.0, 
    # and the rescaled list will be [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]. 
    # This is because 1.0 becomes 0.0, 2.0 becomes 0.25, 3.0 becomes 0.5, 4.0 becomes 0.75, and 5.0 becomes 1.0.

    # The list comprehension is used to apply this transformation to each element in the input list. 
    # This is more efficient than using a for loop, and it's also more readable. 
    # The rescaled list is then returned as the result of the function. 
    # This function can be used to rescale any list of numbers to the unit interval [0, 1]. 
    # It's often used in machine learning and data analysis, where the data needs to be normalized before it can be used. 
    # The rescaled list can then be used as input to a model, or it can be visualized to help understand the data. 
    # The unit interval [0, 1] is a common choice for rescaling, because it's easy to work with and it's a standard unit of measurement. 
    # It's also easy to convert the rescaled list back to its original units, by multiplying each element by the range of the original data. 
    # For example, if the original
