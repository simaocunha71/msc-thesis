    # For example, you might want to visualize a series of numbers that have different units, or where the range of the numbers is very large
    # In these cases, rescaling the numbers to the unit interval can make it easier to visualize and compare the data

    # For example, you might want to train a model on a dataset where the values have different units, or where the range of the values is very large
    # In these cases, rescaling the values to the unit interval can help the model learn more effectively
