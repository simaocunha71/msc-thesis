This function rescales the input list of numbers to be between 0 and 1. It does this by subtracting the smallest value from each number and then dividing by the difference between the largest and smallest values. This ensures that the smallest value in the list becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1. If the list is empty, it returns an empty list.

The function works for lists of any length, and it handles the case where the list contains only one element by returning a list with that element set to 0. It also handles the case where the list contains only two elements by returning a list with those elements set to 0 and 1, respectively.

The function uses list comprehension to create the new list, which makes it more concise and efficient than a traditional for loop. It also uses the built-in min and max functions to find the smallest and largest values in the list, which makes it more readable and easier to maintain.
