The function works by iterating through each character in the message. If the character is a letter, it checks if it is lowercase or uppercase and adjusts accordingly. If the character is a vowel, it replaces it with the character that appears 2 places ahead in the alphabet, or with 'x' or 'X' if it is a lowercase or uppercase vowel, respectively. If the character is not a letter, it simply adds it to the encoded message. The function returns the encoded message. 

For example, 't' becomes 'x' because 't' is 19th in the alphabet and 'x' is the 21st. 'a' becomes 'c' because 'a' is the 1st in the alphabet and 'c' is the 3rd. 'A' becomes 'C' for the same reason. 'i' becomes 'x' because 'i' is the 9th in the alphabet and 'x' is the 11th. And so on. 

This function works for both lowercase and uppercase letters, and it also works for non-letter characters like spaces and punctuation. It handles the case where a vowel is replaced with another vowel correctly, by replacing the vowel with 'x' or 'X'. 

This function is case-sensitive and it only works for letters. It does not handle numbers or special characters. It also assumes that the input is a string. If the input is not a string, the function may not work correctly.  It also assumes that the input is a valid string (i.e., it does not contain any invalid characters). If the input is not a valid string, the function may not work correctly.  It also assumes that the input is in English. If the input is not in English, the function may not work correctly.  It also assumes that the input is not empty. If the input is empty,
