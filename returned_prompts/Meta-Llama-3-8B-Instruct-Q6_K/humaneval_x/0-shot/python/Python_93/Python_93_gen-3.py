The problem requires you to create a function that encodes a given message. The encoding involves two steps: 
1. Swapping the case of all letters (i.e., lowercase becomes uppercase and vice versa).
2. Replacing all vowels with the letter that appears 2 positions ahead of the vowel in the English alphabet. If the vowel is 'y' or 'Y', it should remain unchanged.

Here is the Python solution for the problem:

```
def encode(message):
    vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'
    result = ''
    for char in message:
        if char in vowels:
            if char.islower():
                result += chr((ord(char) - ord('a') + 2) % 26 + ord('a'))
            else:
                result += chr((ord(char) - ord('A') + 2) % 26 + ord('A'))
        elif char.isalpha():
            if char.islower():
                result += chr(ord(char) + 32)
            else:
                result += chr(ord(char) - 32)
        else:
            result += char
    return result
```

In this solution, we iterate over each character in the message. If the character is a vowel, we calculate the new character by adding 2 to the ASCII value of the vowel. We use the modulus operator to ensure that the result is within the range of the English alphabet. If the character is not a vowel and is a letter, we swap its case by adding or subtracting 32 from its ASCII value. If the character is not a letter, we leave it unchanged. The resulting encoded message is then returned.
