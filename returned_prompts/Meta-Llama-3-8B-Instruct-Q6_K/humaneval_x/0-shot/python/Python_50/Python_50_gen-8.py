```
    return "".join([chr(((ord(ch) - ord("a") - 5) % 26) + ord("a")) for ch in s])
```


Explanation:

*   The `encode_shift` function takes a string `s` as input and returns the encoded string. It shifts every character by 5 in the alphabet.
*   The `decode_shift` function takes an encoded string as input and returns the decoded string.
*   Both functions use list comprehensions and the `chr` and `ord` functions to perform the encoding and decoding.
*   The `encode_shift` function uses the expression `((ord(ch) + 5 - ord("a")) % 26) + ord("a")` to shift each character. This expression calculates the ASCII value of the character after shifting, wraps around the alphabet if necessary, and then converts the result back to a character.
*   The `decode_shift` function uses the expression `((ord(ch) - ord("a") - 5) % 26) + ord("a")` to reverse the shift. This expression calculates the ASCII value of the character before shifting, wraps around the alphabet if necessary, and then converts the result back to a character.
*   The `join` function is used to concatenate the encoded or decoded characters into a single string.

Example usage:

```
encoded_string = encode_shift("hello")
print(encoded_string)  # Output: "mjqqt"

decoded_string = decode_shift("mjqqt")
print(decoded_string)  # Output: "hello"
```


This solution is case-sensitive and only works for lowercase letters. If you want to handle uppercase letters and/or preserve the original case, you can modify the functions accordingly. For example, you can add a check for uppercase letters and adjust the shift accordingly. You can also use the `isalpha` method to check if a character is a letter before shifting it.
