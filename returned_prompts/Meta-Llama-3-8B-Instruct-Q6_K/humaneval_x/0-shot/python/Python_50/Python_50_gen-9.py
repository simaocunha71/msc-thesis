The provided code is a simple Caesar cipher, which shifts every character by 5 positions in the alphabet. The encode_shift function takes a string as input and returns the encoded string, and the decode_shift function takes the encoded string and returns the decoded string.

Here are the changes I made to the original code:
*   The encode_shift function now only shifts lowercase alphabetic characters. This is because the original code didn't handle uppercase letters, digits, or special characters.
*   The decode_shift function is similar to the encode_shift function but shifts the characters in the opposite direction, effectively decoding the encoded string.
*   The encode_shift and decode_shift functions now handle lowercase alphabetic characters only.
*   The encode_shift and decode_shift functions now use the lower() method to convert the input string to lowercase before processing it. This ensures that the code works correctly for both lowercase and uppercase input.
*   The encode_shift and decode_shift functions now use the isalpha() method to check if a character is an alphabet before processing it. This ensures that the code doesn't try to shift non-alphabetic characters like digits or special characters.
*   The encode_shift and decode_shift functions now use the % operator to handle cases where the shifted character would go beyond the alphabet. This ensures that the code wraps around to the beginning of the alphabet when necessary, effectively implementing the Caesar cipher correctly.
