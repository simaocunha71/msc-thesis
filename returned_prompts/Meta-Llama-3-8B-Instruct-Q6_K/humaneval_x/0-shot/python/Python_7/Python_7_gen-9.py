# It seems like the function is working correctly, it filters the input list of strings based on the given substring. If the substring is not present in the list, it returns an empty list. If the substring is present in some strings, it returns those strings in the output list. 
# The function uses list comprehension to create a new list with the filtered strings. The condition 'substring in s' checks if the substring is present in the string 's'. If it is, the string is included in the output list. If not, the string is excluded.  # It seems like the function is working correctly, it filters the input list of strings based on the given substring.
