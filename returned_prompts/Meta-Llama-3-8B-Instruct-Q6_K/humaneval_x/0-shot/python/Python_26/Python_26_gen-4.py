# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4]
print(remove_duplicates(numbers))  # Output: [1, 3, 4]
# Explanation: This code works by iterating over the list of numbers. It uses a set (seen) to keep track of the numbers it has seen so far. For each number in the list, it checks if the number is in the set. If it is, it skips the number. If it is not, it adds the number to the set and includes it in the output list. This way, the function returns a list with all duplicates removed. The order of the elements in the output list is the same as in the input list.  # noqa: E501
# The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input list, because it makes one pass over the list. The space complexity is also O(n), because in the worst case (when all numbers are different), the set will contain all the numbers in the list.  # noqa: E501
# The unit test provided ensures that the function works correctly for the given example. It would be good to add more unit tests to ensure the function works correctly for other examples as well.  # noqa: E501
# The function is designed to be used with a list of integers, but it could be modified to work with other types of data as well. For example, it could be modified to work with a list of strings, or a list of objects.  # noqa: E501
# The function is easy to use and understand, but it could be improved by adding more comments and docstrings to explain how it works and what it does.  # noqa: E501
# The function is relatively efficient, but it could be improved by using a more efficient data structure, such as a dictionary, to keep track of the numbers it has seen.  # noqa: E501
