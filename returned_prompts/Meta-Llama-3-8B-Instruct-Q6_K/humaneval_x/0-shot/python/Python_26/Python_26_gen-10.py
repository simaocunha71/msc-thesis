Explanation:
In this problem, we need to create a function that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list with all duplicate elements removed, while preserving the original order of elements.

Here's how we can solve this problem using Python. We can use the `OrderedDict` class from the `collections` module to achieve this. The `OrderedDict` class is a dictionary subclass that remembers the order that keys were first inserted.

We create an `OrderedDict` object from the input list, which automatically removes duplicate elements while preserving the order. Then, we convert the `OrderedDict` object back to a list using the `list` function.

The resulting list has all duplicate elements removed, and the order of elements is preserved. This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list, because it needs to iterate over the list to create the `OrderedDict` object.

Here's the code:
```
from typing import List
from collections import OrderedDict

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    unique_numbers = list(OrderedDict.fromkeys(numbers))
    return unique_numbers
```
This function takes a list of integers as input, creates an `OrderedDict` object from it, and returns a new list with all duplicate elements removed. The order of elements is preserved. For example, if the input is `[1, 2, 3, 2, 4]`, the output will be `[1, 3, 4]`.
