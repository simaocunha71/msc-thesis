The task is to create a function that takes an integer n as input and returns the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.

Here's the Python solution for the problem:

```Python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:
            str_i = str(i)
            count += str_i.count('7')
    return count
```

This function works by iterating over all integers less than n. For each integer, it checks if the integer is divisible by 11 or 13. If it is, it converts the integer to a string and counts the number of times the digit 7 appears in the string. The total count is then returned.

The unit tests provided in the problem statement check if the function returns the correct count for the given inputs. For example, `fizz_buzz(50)` should return 0 because there are no integers less than 50 that are divisible by 11 or 13 and contain the digit 7. `fizz_buzz(78)` should return 2 because the integers 77 and 78 are less than 78, are divisible by 11 or 13, and contain the digit 7. `fizz_buzz(79)` should return 3 because the integers 77, 78, and 79 are less than 79, are divisible by 11 or 13, and contain the digit 7.
