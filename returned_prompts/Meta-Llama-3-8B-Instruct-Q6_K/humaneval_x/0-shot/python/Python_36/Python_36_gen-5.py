```
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:
            str_i = str(i)
            count += str_i.count('7')
    return count
```


This function works by iterating over all integers less than `n`, checking if they are divisible by 11 or 13, and if so, counting the number of times the digit 7 appears in the integer. The `count` variable is incremented each time the digit 7 is found. The function returns the total count at the end. The unit tests provided in the problem statement can be used to verify the correctness of the function. For example, `fizz_buzz(50)` should return `0`, because there are no integers less than 50 that are divisible by 11 or 13 and contain the digit 7. `fizz_buzz(78)` should return `2`, because 77 and 73 are both less than 78 and divisible by 11 and 13, respectively, and contain the digit 7. `fizz_buzz(79)` should return `3`, because 77, 73, and 79 are all less than 79 and divisible by 11, 13, or both, and contain the digit 7.
