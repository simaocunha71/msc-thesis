```
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:
            str_i = str(i)
            if '7' in str_i:
                count += 1
    return count
```


Explanation:
The function `fizz_buzz(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than `n` which are divisible by 11 or 13.

The function iterates over all integers from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive) and checks if each integer is divisible by 11 or 13. If an integer is divisible by either 11 or 13, it is converted to a string and checked if it contains the digit 7. If it does, the count is incremented.

Finally, the function returns the count.

The unit tests provided help to clarify the expected behavior of the function. For example, `fizz_buzz(50)` returns 0 because no integers less than 50 are divisible by 11 or 13, and therefore the digit 7 does not appear in any of these integers. On the other hand, `fizz_buzz(78)` returns 2 because the integers 77 and 78 are divisible by 11 or 13 and contain the digit 7. Similarly, `fizz_buzz(79)` returns 3 because the integers 77, 78, and 79 are divisible by 11 or 13 and contain the digit 7.
