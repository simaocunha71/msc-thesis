```
def sum_to_n(n: int):
    return sum(range(1, n + 1))
```
The function sum_to_n(n) takes an integer n as input and returns the sum of all integers from 1 to n. This is done using the built-in Python function sum() and the range() function, which generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 and ending at n. The sum() function then calculates the sum of this sequence.

For example, if we call sum_to_n(30), the function will return 465, which is the sum of all integers from 1 to 30. Similarly, sum_to_n(100) will return 5050, and so on. The function also works for smaller inputs, such as sum_to_n(5) which returns 15, or sum_to_n(1) which returns 1. The function also works for larger inputs, such as sum_to_n(10) which returns 55. 

The function is tested with several inputs to ensure that it works correctly. The output of the function for each input is shown in the comments. This helps to verify that the function is working as expected.
