The problem is asking for the largest prime factor of a given number. We can solve this problem by iterating from the given number down to 2 and checking if the number is divisible by the current iteration. If it is, then we divide the number by the current iteration and repeat the process until the number is not divisible by the current iteration. We keep track of the largest prime factor found so far and return it at the end.

Here is the solution in Python:
```
def largest_prime_factor(n: int):
    i = 2
    largest_factor = 1
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            largest_factor = i
    return largest_factor
```
This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the largest prime factor of `n`. The function works by iterating from 2 to the square root of `n` and checking if `n` is divisible by the current iteration. If it is, then the function divides `n` by the current iteration and updates the largest prime factor found so far. Finally, the function returns the largest prime factor found.

For example, if we call the function with `n=13195`, it will return `29`, which is the largest prime factor of `13195`. Similarly, if we call the function with `n=2048`, it will return `2`, which is the largest prime factor of `2048`.

The time complexity of this function is O(sqrt(n)), which is efficient for large values of `n`. The space complexity is O(1), which means the function uses a constant amount of space.
