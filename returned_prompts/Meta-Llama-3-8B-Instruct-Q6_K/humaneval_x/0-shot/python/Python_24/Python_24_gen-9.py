The problem is asking to find the largest divisor of a given number `n`, which is smaller than `n`. This problem can be solved by iterating from `n-1` down to `1` and checking if each number is a divisor of `n`. If a divisor is found, it is the largest divisor smaller than `n`.

Here is the Python solution:
```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    for i in range(n-1, 0, -1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return i
```
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), as we iterate from `n-1` down to `1`. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the loop variable `i` and the result `i`. 

For example, if we call `largest_divisor(15)`, the function will return `5`, which is the largest divisor of `15` smaller than `15`. 

Note that this solution assumes that `n` is a positive integer. If `n` can be negative or a non-integer, additional checks and handling would be needed.
