    return [x if i % 2 != 0 else sorted([x for x in l if i % 2 == 0])[0] for i, x in enumerate(l)]


```

This function uses list comprehension to create a new list. It iterates over the input list and checks the index of each element. If the index is odd, it keeps the element as it is. If the index is even, it sorts the elements at the same indices and keeps the first one. The result is a list with the even indices sorted.

The time complexity of this function is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the length of the input list. The space complexity is O(n) for the new list.

The unit tests provided check the function with two examples: one with a list of length 3 and one with a list of length 4. The expected results are also provided. For example, the test `>>> sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4])` checks that the function returns `[3, 6, 5, 4]`, which is the desired output.
