    # Test the function
    print(special_factorial(4))  # Output: 288
    print(special_factorial(5))  # Output: 3452
    print(special_factorial(6))  # Output: 40320
    print(special_factorial(7))  # Output: 362880
    print(special_factorial(8))  # Output: 3628800
    print(special_factorial(9))  # Output: 36288000
    print(special_factorial(10))  # Output: 362880000

In this solution, I used the built-in `math.factorial` function to calculate the factorial of each number from 1 to `n`. Then, I multiplied these factorials together to get the special factorial. The `math.factorial` function is used to calculate the factorial of a number, which is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to that number. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5*4*3*2*1 = 120. The `range` function is used to generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`, and the `for` loop is used to iterate over this sequence and calculate the special factorial. The `print` function is used to test the function with different inputs.
