```
def special_factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= i * special_factorial(i - 1)
    return result
```

This function calculates the special factorial of a given integer `n`. It uses a recursive approach, where it calls itself with decreasing values of `n` until it reaches 1, and then multiplies the results together. The base case for the recursion is `n == 1`, where the special factorial is defined as 1.

The function starts with a result of 1 and then iterates from 1 to `n`, multiplying the result by `i` and the special factorial of `i - 1` in each iteration. This ensures that the special factorial of `n` is calculated correctly.

For example, when `n` is 4, the function will calculate the special factorial as follows:
```
special_factorial(4) = 4 * special_factorial(3)
                     = 4 * (3 * special_factorial(2))
                     = 4 * (3 * (2 * special_factorial(1)))
                     = 4 * (3 * (2 * 1))
                     = 24
```
Therefore, the special factorial of 4 is 24. The function will return this result.
