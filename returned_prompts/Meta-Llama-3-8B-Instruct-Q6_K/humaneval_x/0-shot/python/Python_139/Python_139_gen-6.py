The special factorial is defined as the product of all positive integers from 1 to n, multiplied by the special factorial of n-1. The base case is when n is 0 or 1, in which case the special factorial is 1. The function uses recursion to calculate the special factorial of n. It starts from n=1 and recursively calls itself until it reaches the base case, then it multiplies the results to get the final answer. The time complexity is O(n) and the space complexity is O(n) due to the recursion stack.
