Explanation:

The function `special_factorial` calculates the Brazilian factorial of a given integer `n`. It first checks if `n` is a positive integer. If it's not, it raises a `ValueError`.

Then, it initializes a variable `result` to 1. It loops from 1 to `n` (inclusive), multiplying `result` by the factorial of each integer `i` in the range. The `math.factorial` function is used to calculate the factorial of each integer.

Finally, it returns the calculated Brazilian factorial. The result is the product of all factorials from 1 to `n`.

For example, when `n` is 4, the function calculates the product of 4!, 3!, 2!, and 1!, which is 288. This is the expected result for `special_factorial(4)`.
