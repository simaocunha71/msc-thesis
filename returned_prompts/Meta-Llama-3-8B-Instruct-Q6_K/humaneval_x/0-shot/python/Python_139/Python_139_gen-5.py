Explanation:
The function `special_factorial` calculates the special factorial of a given integer `n`. It checks if `n` is less than or equal to 0, and if so, raises a `ValueError` because the special factorial is only defined for positive integers.

Then, it initializes a variable `result` to 1, and uses a for loop to calculate the special factorial. The loop iterates from 1 to `n`, and for each iteration, it multiplies the current value of `result` by the factorial of the current number `i`. The result is then returned.

The `math.factorial` function is used to calculate the factorial of each number, which is a built-in function in Python that returns the factorial of a given number.

For example, if we call `special_factorial(4)`, the function will calculate the special factorial of 4, which is `4! * 3! * 2! * 1! = 24 * 6 * 2 * 1 = 288`, and return the result, which is `288`.
