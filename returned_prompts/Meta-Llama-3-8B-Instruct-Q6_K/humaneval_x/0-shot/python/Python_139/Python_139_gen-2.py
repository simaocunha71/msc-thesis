```

This function calculates the special factorial of a given integer `n`. It initializes a variable `result` to 1, then iterates over the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive), multiplying `result` by the factorial of each integer in the range. Finally, it returns the calculated special factorial. The `math.factorial` function is used to calculate the factorial of each integer. Note that this function will raise a `RecursionError` if `n` is too large, as the factorials will exceed the maximum recursion depth. You can use a loop instead of recursion to avoid this issue.
