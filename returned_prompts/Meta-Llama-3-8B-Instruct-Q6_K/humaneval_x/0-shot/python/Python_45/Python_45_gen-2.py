    return 0.5 * a * h
# This function calculates the area of a triangle given the length of a side (a) and the height (h). The area is calculated using the formula (base * height) / 2. The function takes two arguments, a and h, and returns the area as a float. The example given in the docstring is a test case, and the function should return 7.5 when given the arguments 5 and 3.  # This function calculates the area of a triangle given the length of a side (a) and the height (h).
