    return 0.5 * a * h


def main():
    a = float(input("Enter the length of the side: "))
    h = float(input("Enter the height of the triangle: "))
    print("The area of the triangle is: ", triangle_area(a, h))

main()  # call the main function


Output:
Enter the length of the side: 5
Enter the height of the triangle: 3
The area of the triangle is:  7.5


Explanation:
In this problem, we need to write a function that calculates the area of a triangle given the length of one side (a) and the height (h). The formula for the area of a triangle is 0.5 * a * h. We also need to create a main function that asks the user for the input values and then prints the calculated area. The unit test provided is `>>> triangle_area(5, 3) 7.5`, which helps us verify that our function is working correctly. In the main function, we use the `input` function to get the user input and convert it to a float using the `float` function. We then call the `triangle_area` function with the input values and print the result.
