# Correct Bracketing Function

Explanation:
The function `correct_bracketing` takes a string of brackets as input and returns a boolean indicating whether every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. It uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. For each bracket in the input string, if it's an opening bracket, it's pushed onto the stack. If it's a closing bracket, the function checks if the stack is empty. If it is, it means there's no corresponding opening bracket, so the function returns `False`. If the stack is not empty, it pops the opening bracket from the stack. Finally, after processing all brackets, the function checks if the stack is empty. If it is, it means every opening bracket had a corresponding closing bracket, so the function returns `True`. If the stack is not empty, it means there were some opening brackets without corresponding closing brackets, so the function returns `False`.  # Correct Bracketing Function

This solution uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. It iterates over the input string, pushing opening brackets onto the stack and popping them off when it encounters a closing bracket. If it encounters a closing bracket when the stack is empty, it means there's no corresponding opening bracket, so it returns `False`. If it finishes processing all brackets and the stack is empty, it means every opening bracket had a corresponding closing bracket, so it returns `True`. If the stack is not empty, it means there were some opening brackets without corresponding closing brackets, so it returns `False`.  # Correct Bracketing Function

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because it iterates over the string once. The space complexity is O(n) as well, because in the worst case, all brackets are opening brackets, so the stack would store all of them.  # Correct Bracketing Function

This solution is correct because it correctly identifies whether every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. It uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets, which ensures that it correctly handles nested brackets.  # Correct Bracketing Function

The unit tests provided ensure that the function works correctly for different inputs. For example, the test `correct_br
