# Explanation: 
# This function uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. 
# When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty. 
# If the stack is empty, it means there's no corresponding opening bracket, so it returns False. 
# If the stack is not empty, it pops the opening bracket from the stack. 
# At the end, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, it means all opening brackets had corresponding closing brackets, so it returns True. 
# If the stack is not empty, it means there were some opening brackets without corresponding closing brackets, so it returns False.  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #
