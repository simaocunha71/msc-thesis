This solution uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. When a closing bracket is encountered, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, it means there's no corresponding opening bracket, so it returns False. If the stack is not empty, it pops the opening bracket from the stack. After going through all the brackets, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, it means every opening bracket had a corresponding closing bracket, so it returns True. If the stack is not empty, it means there were some opening brackets without corresponding closing brackets, so it returns False.
