# Explanation
This function uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. When an opening bracket is encountered, it is pushed onto the stack. When a closing bracket is encountered, it checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means there is no corresponding opening bracket for the current closing bracket, so it returns False. If the stack is not empty, it pops the opening bracket from the stack. After iterating through all the brackets, it checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so it returns True. If the stack is not empty, it means there are unmatched opening brackets, so it returns False.
# Complexity
Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
Space complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
# Note
This function assumes that the input string only contains '(' and ')'. If the input string can contain other characters, you should add error handling code.
