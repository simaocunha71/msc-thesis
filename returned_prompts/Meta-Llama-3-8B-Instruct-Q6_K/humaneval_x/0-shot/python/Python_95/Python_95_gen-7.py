def check_dict_case(dict):
    if not dict:
        return False
    
    all_lower = all(isinstance(key, str) and key.islower() for key in dict.keys())

The provided Python function `check_dict_case` takes a dictionary as input and checks whether all keys are either in lower case or in upper case. If the dictionary is empty, it returns `False`. It uses the `isinstance` function to check if each key is a string, and the `islower` and `isupper` methods to check the case of each key. The `all` function is used to ensure that all keys satisfy the condition. If all keys are in lower case or in upper case, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function handles cases where the dictionary has a mix of key types (e.g., strings and integers) or where some keys are in lower case and others are in upper case. It also handles cases where the dictionary has no keys.
