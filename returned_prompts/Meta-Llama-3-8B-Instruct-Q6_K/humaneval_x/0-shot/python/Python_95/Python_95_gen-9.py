The provided function checks if all keys in the given dictionary are strings in either lower case or upper case. It iterates over each key in the dictionary, and if the key is not a string, it immediately returns False. 

The function also maintains a set called `case_type` to keep track of the case of the first character of each key. If the set contains more than one unique character, it means that the dictionary has keys with different cases, so the function returns False. 

If the dictionary is not empty and all keys are strings, the function checks if the `case_type` set contains only one unique character. If it does, the function returns True, indicating that all keys are in the same case. If the set contains more than one unique character, the function returns False, indicating that the dictionary has keys with different cases. 

Here is the Python code implementing the above logic:

```python
def check_dict_case(dict):
    if not dict:
        return False
