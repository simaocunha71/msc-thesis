def check_dict_case(dict):

    all_lower = all(isinstance(key, str) and key.islower() for key in dict.keys())

Explanation:
The function `check_dict_case` takes a dictionary as an argument. It first checks if the dictionary is empty by using `if not dict`. If the dictionary is empty, it returns `False`.

Then, it checks if all keys in the dictionary are strings in lower case by using `all` function with a generator expression. The `all` function returns `True` if all elements of the iterable (in this case, the generator expression) are true. The generator expression checks if each key is a string and if it is in lower case using `isinstance` and `islower` methods. If all keys are strings in lower case, it returns `True`.

It also checks if all keys in the dictionary are strings in upper case in a similar way.

Finally, it returns `True` if either all keys are strings in lower case or all keys are strings in upper case, otherwise it returns `False`. This ensures that the function returns `True` if all keys are in the same case (either lower or upper) and `False` if keys are in different cases.
