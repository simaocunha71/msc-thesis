    return [abs(score-guess) for score,guess in zip(game,guess)]


B:

    result = []
    for score, guess in zip(game, guess):
        if score == guess:
            result.append(0)
        else:
            result.append(abs(score - guess))
    return result


C:

    return [abs(x-y) for x,y in zip(game,guess)]


D:

    return list(map(lambda x,y: abs(x-y),game,guess))



The correct answer is C:

    return [abs(x-y) for x,y in zip(game,guess)]

This is a simple and efficient solution that uses the built-in zip function to iterate over the two input lists simultaneously, and a list comprehension to create the output list. The abs function is used to calculate the absolute difference between each score and guess. This solution is easy to understand and implement, and it has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input lists.
