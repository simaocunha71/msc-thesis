    return [abs(guess - game) for guess, game in zip(guess, game)]


B:

    return [0 if guess == game else abs(guess - game) for guess, game in zip(guess, game)]


C:

    return [abs(guess - game) if guess != game else 0 for guess, game in zip(guess, game)]


D:

    return [abs(guess - game) if abs(guess - game) < 0 else 0 for guess, game in zip(guess, game)]


E:

    return [0 if guess == game else abs(guess - game) if guess > game else abs(guess - game) for guess, game in zip(guess, game)]


F:

    return [0 if guess == game else abs(guess - game) for guess, game in zip(guess, game)]


Explanation:
The provided code defines a function compare() that compares the guess with the actual game scores and returns a list of the differences. 

The function uses list comprehension to iterate over the guess and game lists simultaneously, using the zip() function to pair corresponding elements. For each pair, it calculates the absolute difference between the guess and the game score, and adds this value to the result list.

The function does not require any additional conditions or loops. It is a simple and efficient solution that directly calculates the differences between the guesses and the game scores. 

For example, if the input is compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]), the output will be [0,0,0,0,3,3]. If the input is compare([0,5,0,0,0,4],[4,1,1,0,0,-2]), the output will be [4,4,1,0,0,6].
