The function double_the_difference takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of the squares of the odd numbers in the list that are positive integers.

Here is how the function works:

1. It uses a generator expression to iterate over the input list.
2. For each number in the list, it checks if the number is an integer (using isinstance), positive (using num > 0), and odd (using num % 2 != 0).
3. If the number meets these conditions, it squares the number (using num ** 2).
4. It sums up the squares of the odd numbers using the sum function.
5. If the input list is empty, the function returns 0.

Here is the code:
```
def double_the_difference(lst):
    return sum(num ** 2 for num in lst if isinstance(num, int) and num
