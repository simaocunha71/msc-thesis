The code provided defines a function `double_the_difference` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of squares of the numbers in the list that are odd. The function uses list comprehension to iterate over the input list and filter out the numbers that are not integers or are not positive. It then squares the remaining numbers and sums them up.

The function is tested with several examples, including edge cases such as an empty list, a list with only negative numbers, and a list with a mix of positive and negative numbers.

Here is the code:

```python
def double_the_difference(lst):
    return sum([x**2 for x in lst if isinstance(x, int) and x > 0 and x % 2 != 0])
```

This function works as follows:

1. `isinstance(x, int)`: This checks if the current element `x` is an integer.
2. `x > 0`: This checks if the current element `x` is positive.
3. `x % 2 != 0`: This checks if the current element `x` is odd.
4. `x**2`: This squares the current element `x`.
5. `sum(...)`: This sums up the squared odd positive integers.

The function returns the sum of squares of the numbers in the list that are odd, ignoring numbers that are negative or not integers. If the input list is empty, the function returns 0.
