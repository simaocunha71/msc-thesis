    for char in s:
        if char.isalpha():
            result.append(char.swapcase())
        else:

Explanation:
The function `solve` takes a string `s` as input and returns the modified string.
It iterates over each character in the string. If the character is a letter, it is reversed using the `swapcase` method. If the character is not a letter, it is left unchanged. 

After processing all characters, if the string does not contain any letters, it is reversed using the `reverse` method. Finally, the modified string is returned using the `join` method.
