Explanation:
The function `solve` takes a string `s` as input. It iterates over each character in the string. If the character is a letter, it checks if it's lowercase or uppercase, and if it's lowercase, it converts it to uppercase and vice versa. If the character is not a letter, it keeps it as it is.

After processing all characters, it checks if the resulting string contains any letters. If not, it reverses the string. Finally, it returns the resulting string. This is done to satisfy the condition that if the string contains no letters, it should be reversed.

The function `isalpha()` is used to check if a character is a letter, and `islower()` and `isupper()` are used to check if a letter is lowercase or uppercase. The `upper()` and `lower()` methods are used to convert letters to uppercase and lowercase respectively. The `[::-1]` slicing is used to reverse the string.
