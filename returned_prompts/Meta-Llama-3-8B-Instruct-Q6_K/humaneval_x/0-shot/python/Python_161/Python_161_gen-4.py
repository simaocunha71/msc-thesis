The problem is asking you to create a function that takes a string as input, and then processes the string according to certain conditions. If a character in the string is a letter, it should be converted to its opposite case (i.e., if it is lowercase, it should be converted to uppercase, and vice versa). If a character is not a letter, it should be left as it is. Additionally, if the string contains no letters, the entire string should be reversed.

Here's a Python function that accomplishes this:

```
def solve(s):
    result = []
    for char in s:
        if char.isalpha():
            result.append(char.swapcase())
        else:
            result.append(char)
    if not any(char.isalpha() for char in s):
        result = result[::-1]
    return ''.join(result)
```

This function iterates over each character in the input string. If the character is a letter, it converts it to its opposite case using the `swapcase()` method. If the character is not a letter, it leaves it as it is. After processing all characters, it checks if the string contains any letters. If not, it reverses the string using slicing (`result[::-1]`). Finally, it joins the processed characters into a single string using the `join()` method.
