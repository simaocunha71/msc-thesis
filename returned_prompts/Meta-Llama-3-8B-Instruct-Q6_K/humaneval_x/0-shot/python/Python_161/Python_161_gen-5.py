```
def solve(s):
    result = ""
    for i in s:
        if i.isalpha():
            result += i.swapcase()
        else:
            result += i
    if not result.isalpha():
        result = result[::-1]
    return result
```





Note: This solution assumes that the input string `s` only contains ASCII characters. If the input string can contain non-ASCII characters, the solution may need to be modified to handle those characters correctly.
