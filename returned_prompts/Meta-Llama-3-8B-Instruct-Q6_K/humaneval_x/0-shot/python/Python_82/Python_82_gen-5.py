The provided code defines a function `prime_length` that takes a string as input and returns `True` if the length of the string is a prime number, and `False` otherwise. The function uses a helper function `is_prime` to check if a given number is prime.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. `length = len(string)`: This line calculates the length of the input string.
2. `def is_prime(n)`: This is a helper function that checks if a given number `n` is prime.
3. `if n <= 1: return False`: This line checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1. If so, it returns `False`, since 0 and 1 are not prime numbers.
4. `if n == 2: return True`: This line checks if `n` is equal to 2. If so, it returns `True`, since 2 is a prime number.
5. `if n % 2 == 0: return False`: This line checks if `n` is divisible by 2. If so, it returns `False`, since even numbers greater than 2 are not prime.
6. `i = 3; while i * i <= n: ...`: This loop checks if `n` is divisible by any odd number up to its square root. If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, it returns `False`.
7. `return True`: If `n` is not divisible by any of the above numbers, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

The `prime_length` function simply calls the `is_prime` function with the length of the input string as its argument and returns the result.

Note that this implementation is not the most efficient way to check for primality, but it is sufficient for the given examples. For larger numbers, a more efficient algorithm like the Miller-Rabin primality test may be needed.
