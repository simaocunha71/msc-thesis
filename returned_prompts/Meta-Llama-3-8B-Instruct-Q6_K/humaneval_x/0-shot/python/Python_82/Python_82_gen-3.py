The function `prime_length` calculates the length of the input string and then checks if this length is a prime number. It uses a helper function `is_prime` to check if a number is prime. This function checks if the number is divisible by any number up to its square root. If it is not divisible, then it is a prime number. The `prime_length` function returns `True` if the string length is a prime number and `False` otherwise. 

The unit tests provided in the problem statement ensure that the function works correctly. For example, `prime_length('Hello')` returns `True` because the length of the string 'Hello' is 5, which is a prime number. Similarly, `prime_length('abcdcba')` returns `True` because the length of the string 'abcdcba' is 7, which is also a prime number. On the other hand, `prime_length('orange')` returns `False` because the length of the string 'orange' is 6, which is not a prime number. 

This solution is efficient because it only needs to check divisibility up to the square root of the number, which reduces the number of iterations. It also correctly handles the case where the input string is empty. 

However, this solution could be improved by adding a check at the beginning of the `is_prime` function to return `True` immediately if the number is less than 2, since these numbers are not prime. This optimization is shown in the code above. 

This solution assumes that the input string is not empty. If the input string can be empty, it should be checked at the beginning of the `prime_length` function and `True` should be returned in this case. This is because the length of an empty string is 0, which is not a prime number. 

This solution also assumes that the input string contains only ASCII characters. If the input string can contain non-ASCII characters, it should be checked at the beginning of the `prime_length` function and an error should be raised in this case, since the length of a string containing non-ASCII characters may not be
