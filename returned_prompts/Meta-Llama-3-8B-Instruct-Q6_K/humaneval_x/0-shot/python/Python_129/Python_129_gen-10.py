The problem can be solved by using dynamic programming. We create a 2D dictionary `dp` where `dp[i][j]` is a dictionary that maps the values to their corresponding positions in the grid.

We initialize `dp` with the base case where `k` is 0, by setting `dp[i][j][0]` to `(i, j)` for all `i` and `j`.

Then, we iterate `k` times and update `dp` by considering all possible moves from each cell. For each cell `(i, j)`, we update `dp[i][j]` with the values and positions of its neighbors.

Finally, we start from the initial position `(0, 0)` and follow the minimum path by always moving to the cell with the smallest value that has not been visited yet.

Here is the Python code that implements this algorithm:

```
def minPath(grid, k):
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    dp = [[{} for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]
