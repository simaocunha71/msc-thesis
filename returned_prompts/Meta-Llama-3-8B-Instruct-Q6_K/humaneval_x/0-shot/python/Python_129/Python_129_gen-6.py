    The problem is about finding the minimum path of length k in a grid. The path can start from any cell, and in each step, it can move to any of the neighbor cells. The path cannot go off the grid, and it must visit exactly k cells.

    The problem can be solved using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. The idea is to start from each cell and explore all the possible paths of length k. For each path, we calculate the sum of the values on the cells that it visits and store the path with the minimum sum.

    Here is a Python solution using DFS:

    ```
    def minPath(grid, k):
        N = len(grid)
        result = []
        min_sum = float('inf')

        def dfs(i, j, path, path_sum):
            nonlocal min_sum, result
            path_sum += grid[i][j]
            path.append(grid[i][j])

            if len(path) == k:
                if path_sum < min_sum:
                    min_sum = path_sum
                    result = path[:]
                return

            for di, dj in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
                ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                if 0 <= ni < N and 0 <= nj < N and grid[ni][nj] not in path:
                    dfs(ni, nj, path, path_sum)

            path.pop()
            path_sum -= grid[i][j]

        for i in range(N):
            for j in range(N):
                dfs(i, j, [], 0)

        return result
    ```

    This solution starts from each cell in the grid and explores all the possible paths of length k. For each path, it calculates the sum of the values on the cells that it visits and stores the path with the minimum sum. The function returns the minimum path.
