Explanation:
The problem can be solved by using depth-first search (DFS). The DFS function is used to explore all possible paths of length k from each cell. The path is considered as a list of values of cells visited so far. When the length of the path reaches k, we check if the current path is less than the minimum path found so far and update the minimum path if necessary.

The DFS function takes three parameters: the current cell's coordinates (i, j), and the current path. The function marks the current cell as visited, then explores all its neighbor cells. For each neighbor cell, it recursively calls the DFS function with the updated path. After exploring all neighbor cells, it unmarks the current cell as visited.

The main function initializes the visited grid and the minimum path, then calls the DFS function from each cell. Finally, it returns the minimum path.

The time complexity of this solution is O(N^2 * k), where N is the size of the grid, because in the worst case, we have to visit each cell k times. The space complexity is O(N^2), because we need to store the visited grid.
