This is a solution that uses depth-first search (DFS) to find the minimum path. It starts from each cell in the grid and explores all possible paths of length k. For each path, it checks if it is the minimum path by comparing it with the current minimum path.

The DFS function takes three parameters: the current cell's coordinates (i, j) and the current path. It first checks if the path's length has reached k. If it has, it checks if the path is the minimum path by comparing it with the current minimum path. If it is, it updates the minimum path.

Then, it explores all possible next cells by checking the four neighboring cells (up, down, left, right). For each next cell, it marks it as visited and recursively calls the DFS function with the next cell's coordinates and the current path plus the value of the next cell.

Finally, it unmarks the next cell as visited to backtrack.

The main function iterates over all cells in the grid and calls the DFS function from each cell. It returns the minimum path.

This solution has a time complexity of O(N^2 * M^2 * k), where N is the number of rows, M is the number of columns, and k is the length of the path. This is because it explores all possible paths of length k from each cell in the grid. The space complexity is O(N * M), which is the space used by the visited matrix.
