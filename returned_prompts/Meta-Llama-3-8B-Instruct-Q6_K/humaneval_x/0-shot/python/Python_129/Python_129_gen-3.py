The problem can be solved by using Depth-First Search (DFS). The idea is to start from each cell in the grid and use DFS to find the minimum path of length k. The DFS function takes the current cell coordinates, the remaining length of the path, and the current path as arguments. If the remaining length of the path is 0, it means we have found a valid path of length k, so we return the current path. Otherwise, we mark the current cell as visited, add its value to the current path, and recursively call the DFS function for each of the four neighboring cells. If any of these recursive calls return a valid path, we return it. If none of them return a valid path, we backtrack by removing the current cell from the current path and marking it as unvisited. We repeat this process for each cell in the grid until we find a valid path of length k or we have checked all cells. If we have checked all cells and haven't found a valid path of length k, we return an empty list.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2 * m^2), where n and m are the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively. This is because in the worst case, we need to visit each cell in the grid. The space complexity is O(n * m), which is used to store the visited cells and the current path.
