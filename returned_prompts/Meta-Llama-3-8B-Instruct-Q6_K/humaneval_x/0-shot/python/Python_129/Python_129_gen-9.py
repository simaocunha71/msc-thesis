Here is a Python solution for this problem:

```Python
def minPath(grid, k):
    N = len(grid)
    directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
    visited = [[False] * N for _ in range(N)]
    queue = [(0, 0, [grid[0][0]])]
    min_path = None

    while queue:
        x, y, path = queue.pop(0)
        if len(path) == k:
            if min_path is None or path < min_path:
                min_path = path
        else:
            for dx, dy in directions:
                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                if 0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N and not visited[nx][ny]:
                    visited[nx][ny] = True
                    queue.append((nx, ny, path + [grid[nx][ny]]))
                    visited[nx][ny] = False

    return min_path
```
This function starts a breadth-first search from each cell in the grid. It keeps track of the current path and adds cells to the path as it moves through the grid. When the path reaches a length of k, it checks if it is the minimum path found so far. If it is, it updates the minimum path. The function returns the minimum path.

The function uses a queue to keep track of the cells to visit next. The queue is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the coordinates of a cell and the current path. The function pops the first cell from the queue and checks if it has reached the desired length. If it has, it checks if it is the minimum path found so far. If it is, it updates the minimum path. The function then adds the cell's neighbors to the queue and marks them as visited.

The function uses a visited matrix to keep track of the cells that have been visited. The matrix is a 2D list of booleans, where each cell is initially set to False. The function sets the cell as visited when it adds it to the queue and unvisits it when it is removed from the queue.

The function returns the minimum path found. If no path of length k is found, it returns None. The function is case-sensitive and returns the path in the order that the cells were visited. The function is not optimized for performance and may not work well for large
