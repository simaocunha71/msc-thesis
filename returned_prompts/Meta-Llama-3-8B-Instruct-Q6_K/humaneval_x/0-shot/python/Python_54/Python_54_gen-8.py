def same_chars(s0: str, s1: str):
    return sorted(s0) == sorted(s1)  # Sort the characters in both strings and compare
    # This function works by sorting the characters in both strings and comparing them. If the sorted strings are equal, then the original strings must have the same characters.
    # It does not matter in what order the characters are, as long as they are the same.

Note: This function is case-sensitive and does not handle spaces or punctuation. If you want to ignore these, you would need to preprocess the strings to remove them. For example, you could use the str.translate() method to remove spaces and punctuation.  # noqa: E305
# Example:
# s0 = s0.translate({ord(c): None for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ '})
# s1 = s1.translate({ord(c): None for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ '})
# return sorted(s0) == sorted(s1)  # Sort the characters in both strings and compare
# This function works by sorting the characters in both strings and comparing them. If the sorted strings are equal, then the original strings must have the same characters.
# It does not matter in what order the characters are, as long as they are the same.
# The translate() method is used to remove spaces and punctuation. It works by replacing each character in the string with None, effectively removing it.  # noqa: E305
# For example, if you have a string like 'hello world', you could use the translate() method to remove the spaces like this:
# s = 'hello world'
# s = s.translate({ord(c): None for c in ' '})
# print(s)  # Output: 'helloworld'
# The translate() method is a powerful tool for preprocessing strings, but it can be slow if you are working with very large strings. In that case, you might want to consider using a different method.  # noqa: E305
# For example, you could use the str.replace() method to remove spaces and punctuation, like this:
# s = 'hello world'
# s = s.replace(' ', '')
# s = s.replace('.', '')
# s = s.replace(',', '')
# print(s)  # Output: 'helloworld'
# The replace() method is faster than the translate() method, but it is less flexible. It can only be used to replace a single character or a single string, whereas the translate() method can
