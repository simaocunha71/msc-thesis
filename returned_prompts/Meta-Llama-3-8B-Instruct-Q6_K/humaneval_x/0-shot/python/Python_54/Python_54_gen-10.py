def same_chars(s0: str, s1: str):
    return sorted(s0) == sorted(s1)

# This function sorts the characters in each string and then compares the sorted lists.
# If the sorted lists are equal, then the original strings have the same characters, regardless of their order or frequency.  This means that the function is case-sensitive and treats uppercase and lowercase letters as distinct characters.  For example, 'e' and 'E' are considered different characters.  Also, this function does not consider the frequency of the characters; it only checks if the characters are the same.  This means that 'eabcdzzzz' and 'dddzzzzzzzddeddabc' are considered to have the same characters, even though the frequencies of the characters are different.  If you want to consider the frequency of the characters, you would need a more complex function.  For example, you could count the frequency of each character in each string and then compare the frequency counts.  However, that would be a more complex function, and it would not be as simple or as easy to understand as this one.  It's also worth noting that this function is not very efficient for large strings, because it has to create two new lists of characters and then compare them.  If you need to compare the characters of large strings, you might want to use a different approach.  For example, you could use a dictionary to count the frequency of each character in each string, and then compare the frequency counts.  That would be more efficient, but it would also be more complex and harder to understand.  The choice of approach depends on the specific requirements of your program and the characteristics of your data.  In this case, the simple approach is sufficient, but in other cases, you might need a more complex approach.  It's always a good idea to think carefully about the requirements of your program and the characteristics of your data before you start writing your code.  That will help you choose the right approach and write more efficient and effective code.  It's also a good idea to test your code thoroughly to make sure it works correctly and efficiently, and to refactor your code as needed to make it simpler, more efficient, and more effective.  That will help you write better code and make your program more reliable and maintainable.  It's always a good idea to strive for simplicity, efficiency, and effectiveness in your code, and to be willing to refactor your code as needed to achieve those goals
