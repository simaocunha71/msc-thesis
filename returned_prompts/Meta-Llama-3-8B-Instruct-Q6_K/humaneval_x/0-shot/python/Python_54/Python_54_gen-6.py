    # Check if both strings have the same characters, regardless of order
    return sorted(s0) == sorted(s1)
    # We use the sorted() function to sort the characters in each string.
    # If the sorted strings are equal, then the original strings had the same characters, regardless of order. 
    # If the sorted strings are not equal, then the original strings did not have the same characters. 
    # This function is case-sensitive and does not treat characters as unique based on their ASCII values. 
    # If you want to treat uppercase and lowercase letters as the same, you can convert both strings to lower case or upper case before comparing them. 
    # For example, you can use the lower() or upper() method: return sorted(s0).lower() == sorted(s1).lower() 
    # This will treat uppercase and lowercase letters as the same and convert all letters to lowercase before comparing them. 

    # You can also use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each character in both strings, 
    # and then compare the dictionaries. This approach is more efficient than sorting the strings. 
    # Here is how you can do it: 
    from collections import Counter
    return Counter(s0) == Counter(s1) 
    # The Counter class is a dictionary subclass for counting hashable objects. 
    # It is a collection where elements are stored as dictionary keys and their counts are stored as dictionary values. 
    # Counts are allowed to be any integer value including zero or negative counts. 
    # The Counter class is a part of the collections module in Python. 
    # It is often used for counting the frequency of elements in a list, a string, or any other iterable. 
    # It can also be used for counting the occurrences of each word in a text. 
    # In this example, we use it to count the occurrences of each character in both strings. 
    # If the counts are equal for both strings, then the strings have the same characters, regardless of order. 
    # If the counts are not equal for both strings, then the strings did not have the same characters. 
    # This approach is more efficient than sorting the strings because it does not require sorting the characters in the strings. 
    # It also treats uppercase and lowercase letters as the same and converts all letters to lowercase before comparing them. 
    # You can use the lower() or upper() method to convert all letters to either lowercase or
