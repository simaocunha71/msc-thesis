    # Convert the integer to a string
    s = str(x)

    # Calculate the length of the string
    n = len(s)

    # Calculate the actual shift
    shift = shift % n

    # Shift the digits right
    s = s[-shift:] + s[:-shift]

    # Return the result as a string
    return s
    # This code will first convert the integer into a string, then calculate the length of the string, then calculate the actual shift by taking modulus with the length of the string. Then it will shift the digits right by taking a slice of the string from the end up to the shift length and another slice from the start up to the length minus the shift length. Finally it will return the result as a string. This will work for any integer and any shift. If the shift is greater than the number of digits, it will automatically wrap around to the start of the string. For example, if the shift is 3 and the string is "123", it will shift to "321" which is the same as shifting left by 2. If the shift is 4, it will shift to "123" which is the same as shifting left by 3. If the shift is 5, it will shift to "321" which is the same as shifting left by 4. And so on. If the shift is equal to the number of digits, it will just return the original string. If the shift is greater than the number of digits, it will also return the original string. So this function is flexible and can handle any shift. It is also efficient as it only needs to convert the integer to a string once and then perform a few string operations. It does not need to create any temporary strings. So it is efficient and flexible. It can handle any integer and any shift. It is also easy to understand and implement. It is a good example of how to use slicing to shift the digits of an integer. It is also a good example of how to handle circular shifts. It is a good example of how to use the modulus operator to handle shifts that are greater than the number of digits. It is a good example of how to use the length of the string to calculate the actual shift. It is a good example of how to use slicing to shift the digits right. It is a good example of how to use slicing to shift the digits left. It is a good example of how to handle shifts that are greater than the number of
