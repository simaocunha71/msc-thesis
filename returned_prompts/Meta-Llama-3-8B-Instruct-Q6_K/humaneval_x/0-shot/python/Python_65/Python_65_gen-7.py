The problem is asking you to write a function that takes an integer `x` and an integer `shift` as input, and returns the result of shifting the digits of `x` to the right by `shift` places. If `shift` is greater than or equal to the number of digits in `x`, the function should return the digits of `x` in reverse order.

Here is the solution:
```
def circular_shift(x, shift):
    str_x = str(x)
    if shift >= len(str_x):
        return str_x[::-1]
    return str_x[-shift:] + str_x[:-shift]
```
Here's how the function works:

1. Convert the integer `x` to a string using the `str()` function.
2. Check if `shift` is greater than or equal to the length of the string `str_x`. If it is, return the string `str_x` in reverse order using slicing with a step of `-1` (`str_x[::-1]`).
3. Otherwise, return the result of shifting the digits of `x` to the right by `shift` places. This is done by taking the last `shift` characters of the string `str_x` (`str_x[-shift:]`) and concatenating them with the rest of the string (`str_x[:-shift]`).

For example, if `x` is `12` and `shift` is `1`, the function returns `"21"`, which is the result of shifting the digits of `12` to the right by 1 place. If `x` is `12` and `shift` is `2`, the function returns `"12"`, which is the original value of `x`. If `x` is `123` and `shift` is `3`, the function returns `"321"`, which is the result of shifting the digits of `123` to the right by 3 places. If `x` is `123` and `shift` is `4`, the function returns `"321"`, which is the result of reversing the digits of `123`.
