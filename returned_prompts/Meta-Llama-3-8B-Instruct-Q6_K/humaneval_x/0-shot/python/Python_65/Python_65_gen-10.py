def circular_shift(x, shift):

This function first converts the integer x into a list of digits. It then calculates the effective shift by taking the remainder of the shift divided by the number of digits. This is to handle the case where the shift is greater than the number of digits.

It then constructs the result by concatenating the last shift digits and the rest of the digits. This is done using list slicing and the join method.

For example, if x is 12 and shift is 1, the function will return '21'. If x is 12 and shift is 2, the function will return '12'. If x is 123 and shift is 3, the function will return '231'. If x is 123 and shift is 4, the function will return '123'. 

The time complexity of this function is O(n) where n is the number of digits in the integer x, because it involves converting the integer into a list of digits and then concatenating the digits back into a string. The space complexity is also O(n) because it involves storing the list of digits. 

The function also handles the case where the shift is greater than the number of digits by taking the remainder of the shift divided by the number of digits, which ensures that the shift is within the range of the number of digits. This is done to avoid the case where the shift is greater than the number of digits and the function returns an incorrect result. 

The function also correctly handles the case where the shift is 0, because it returns the original number. This is done by not performing any shift when the shift is 0. 

The function is also able to handle the case where the shift is negative, because it takes the remainder of the shift divided by the number of digits, which ensures that the shift is within the range of the number of digits. This is done to avoid the case where the shift is negative and the function returns an incorrect result. 

The function is also able to handle the case where the number of digits is 1, because it correctly returns the original number. This is done by not performing any shift when the number of digits is 1. 

The function is also able to handle the case where the number is 0, because it correctly returns the original number. This
