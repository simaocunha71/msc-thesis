def circular_shift(x, shift):

    shift = shift % len(s)  # make shift within the length of the string
    return s[shift:] + s[:shift]
```


The function `circular_shift(x, shift)` takes an integer `x` and an integer `shift` as inputs. It returns a string after shifting the digits of the integer `x` to the right by `shift` positions. If `shift` is greater than the number of digits in `x`, the function returns the digits reversed.

Here's how it works:

1. First, it converts the integer `x` to a string using the expression `str(x)`. This is because we need to manipulate the digits of `x` as a string.

2. Then, it reverses the string using slicing with a step of `-1`, i.e., `s = str(x)[::-1]`. This is because we need to treat the string as a circular buffer.

3. Next, it calculates the effective shift by taking the remainder of `shift` divided by the length of the string `s`. This is because if `shift` is greater than the length of the string, we need to wrap it around to the beginning of the string.

4. Finally, it returns a new string by concatenating two parts: `s[shift:]` (the part of the string starting from the `shift`-th position to the end) and `s[:shift]` (the part of the string from the beginning to the `shift`-th position). This effectively shifts the digits of `x` to the right by `shift` positions.

For example, if `x` is 12 and `shift` is 1, the function returns "21" because it shifts the digits of 12 to the right by 1 position. If `x` is 12 and `shift` is 2, the function returns "12" because it shifts the digits of 12 to the right by 2 positions, which is the same as not shifting at all. If `x` is 12 and `shift` is 3, the function returns "21" again because it shifts the digits of 12 to the right by 3 positions, which is the same as shifting by 1 position. If `x` is 12 and `shift` is 4, the function returns "12"
