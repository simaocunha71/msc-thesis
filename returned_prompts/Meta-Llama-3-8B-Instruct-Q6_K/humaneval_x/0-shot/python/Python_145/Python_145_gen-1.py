Explanation:
This function uses the built-in sort method in Python. The sort method takes a key function as an argument, which is used to determine the sort order. In this case, the key function is a lambda function that calculates the sum of the digits of the absolute value of each number in the list, and also takes into account the original index of the number in the list. The sort method sorts the list in ascending order based on the key function. The result is a list of numbers sorted by the sum of their digits, with ties broken by their original index in the list.

The lambda function `lambda x: (sum(int(digit) for digit in str(abs(x))), nums.index(x))` is used as the key function. This function takes an integer `x` as input, calculates the sum of its digits using a generator expression, and also returns the index of `x` in the original list `nums`. The sort method uses this key function to determine the sort order of the list.

The `abs` function is used to ensure that the sum of the digits is calculated for the absolute value of each number, so that negative numbers are sorted correctly.

The `str` function is used to convert each number to a string, so that the digits can be iterated over using a generator expression.

The `int` function is used to convert each digit back to an integer, so that the sum of the digits can be calculated correctly.

The `nums.index(x)` function is used to get the index of each number `x` in the original list `nums`, so that ties can be broken by the original index.
