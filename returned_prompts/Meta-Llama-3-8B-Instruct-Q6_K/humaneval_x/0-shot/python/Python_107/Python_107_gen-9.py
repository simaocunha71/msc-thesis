```
def even_odd_palindrome(n):
    even_count = 0
    odd_count = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        str_num = str(i)
        if str_num == str_num[::-1]:
            if int(str_num) % 2 == 0:
                even_count += 1
            else:
                odd_count += 1
    return even_count, odd_count
```







Solution:

The problem is asking to count the number of even and odd integer palindromes within the range (1, n), inclusive. 

Here's a Python solution for the problem:

```
def even_odd_palindrome(n):
    even_count = 0
    odd_count = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        str_num = str(i)
        if str_num == str_num[::-1]:
            if int(str_num) % 2 == 0:
                even_count += 1
            else:
                odd_count += 1
    return even_count, odd_count
```

The function iterates through each number in the range (1, n), converts it to a string, checks if it's a palindrome (by comparing the string with its reverse), and then counts the number of even and odd palindromes. The function returns a tuple containing the counts of even and odd palindromes.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the input number, because it needs to iterate through each number in the range. The space complexity is O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the counts and the current number.
