The function `even_odd_palindrome(n)` takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns a tuple containing the count of even and odd integer palindromes within the range `(1, n)`, inclusive.

The function works by iterating over the range `(1, n+1)` and for each integer `i`:

1.  It checks if the integer is a palindrome by comparing the string representation of `i` with its reverse. This is done using the slicing operation `str(i)[::-1]`.
2.  If the integer is a palindrome, it checks if the integer is even by using the modulo operator `i % 2 == 0`. If the integer is even, it increments the `even_palindromes` counter; otherwise, it increments the `odd_palindromes` counter.
3.  Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the counts of even and odd integer palindromes.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where `n` is the input integer, because it iterates over the range `(1, n+1)` once. The space complexity is O(1), as it uses a constant amount of space to store the counters and other variables.
