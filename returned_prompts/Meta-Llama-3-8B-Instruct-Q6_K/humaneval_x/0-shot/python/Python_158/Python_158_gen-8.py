def find_max(words):
    max_word = max(words, key=lambda x: (len(set(x)), x))
    return max_word
```



The function `find_max` takes a list of strings as input and returns the string with the maximum number of unique characters. If multiple strings have the same maximum number of unique characters, it returns the one that comes first in lexicographical order.

The function uses the built-in `max` function with a custom key to find the maximum string. The key is a lambda function that returns a tuple for each string. The tuple contains two elements: the length of the set of unique characters in the string, and the string itself.

The `max` function first compares the tuples based on the length of the set of unique characters. If multiple strings have the same length, it compares them based on their lexicographical order.

For example, if the input list is `["name", "of", "string"]`, the function will return `"string"` because it has the maximum number of unique characters. If the input list is `["name", "enam", "game"]`, the function will return `"enam"` because it has the maximum number of unique characters and comes first in lexicographical order. If the input list is `["aaaaaaa", "bb", "cc"]`, the function will return `"aaaaaaa"` because it has the maximum number of unique characters. If the input list is empty, the function will return an empty string.
