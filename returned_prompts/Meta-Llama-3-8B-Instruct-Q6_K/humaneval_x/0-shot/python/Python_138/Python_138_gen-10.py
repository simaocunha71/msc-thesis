The function `is_equal_to_sum_even(n)` checks whether the given number `n` can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. It does this by iterating over all possible combinations of 4 even numbers and checking if their sum equals `n`.

Here's a more efficient version of the function:

```
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    for even_num1 in range(2, n+1, 2):
        for even_num2 in range(2, n+1, 2):
            for even_num3 in range(2, n+1, 2):
                if even_num1 + even_num2 + even_num3 > n:
                    break
                for even_num4 in range(2, n+1, 2):
                    if even_num1 + even_num2 + even_num3 + even_num4 == n:
                        return True
    return False
```

In this version, we break out of the inner loop as soon as the sum of the first 3 even numbers exceeds `n`, which reduces the number of iterations. This makes the function more efficient, especially for large values of `n`. However, it still has a time complexity of O(n^2), which may not be efficient enough for very large values of `n`. In that case, you may need to use a more advanced algorithm or data structure, such as a hash table or a dynamic programming approach.
