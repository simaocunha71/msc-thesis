This problem is asking you to write a function that checks whether a given number `n` can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. For example, the number 8 can be written as 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8, so `is_equal_to_sum_even(8)` should return `True`. On the other hand, the number 4 cannot be written as the sum of 4 positive even numbers, so `is_equal_to_sum_even(4)` should return `False`.

Here is a Python solution for this problem:
```
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    for i in range(2, n, 2):
        for j in range(2, n, 2):
            for k in range(2, n, 2):
                for l in range(2, n, 2):
                    if i + j + k + l == n:
                        return True
    return False
```
This function uses four nested loops to iterate over all possible combinations of 4 positive even numbers. If it finds a combination that sums up to `n`, it returns `True`. If it doesn't find any such combination after checking all possibilities, it returns `False`.

Note that the loops start from 2 and increment by 2, because we're only considering positive even numbers. The innermost loop starts from 2 and increments by 2, because we're only considering positive even numbers. The outermost loop starts from 2 and increments by 2, because we're only considering positive even numbers.
