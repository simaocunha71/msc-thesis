This function takes a string as an input and returns a dictionary where the keys are the letters in the string and the values are the counts of each letter. 

First, it checks if the input string is empty. If it is, it returns an empty dictionary. 

Next, it splits the string into a list of letters using the split method with no arguments, which splits the string at each space.

Then, it creates an empty dictionary called letter_count. It iterates over each letter in the list of letters. If the letter is already in the dictionary, it increments the count by 1. If the letter is not in the dictionary, it adds the letter to the dictionary with a count of 1.

After that, it finds the maximum count in the dictionary using the max function with the values method. 

Next, it creates a list of letters that have the maximum count. It does this by iterating over each key-value pair in the dictionary and adding the key to the list if the value is equal to the maximum count.

Finally, it returns a dictionary where the keys are the letters in the list of letters and the values are the counts of each letter. This is done using a dictionary comprehension. 

For example, if the input string is 'a b c a b', the function will return {'a': 2, 'b': 2}. If the input string is 'b b b b a', the function will return {'b': 4}. If the input string is 'a b c a b', the function will return {'a': 2, 'b': 2}. If the input string is '', the function will return an empty dictionary.
