    max_count = max(letter_count.values())

```
This function takes a string `test` as input, splits it into individual letters, and counts the occurrences of each letter. It then finds the maximum count and returns a dictionary with all letters that have this maximum count and their corresponding count. If the input string is empty, the function returns an empty dictionary.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because it needs to iterate over the string once to count the letters. The space complexity is also O(n), because in the worst case, all letters in the string are unique, so the `letter_count` dictionary will contain n entries.
