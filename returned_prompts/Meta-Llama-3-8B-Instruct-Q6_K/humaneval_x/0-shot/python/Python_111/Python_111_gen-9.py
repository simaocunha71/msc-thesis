The provided solution defines a function called `histogram` that takes a string as an argument. The string is split into a list of words using the `split` method, which is then used to create a dictionary where the keys are the letters and the values are their corresponding counts.

The function first checks if the input string is empty. If it is, the function returns an empty dictionary.

The function then iterates over the list of words. For each word, it checks if the word is already a key in the dictionary. If it is, the value for that key is incremented by 1. If the word is not a key in the dictionary, it is added as a key with a value of 1.

The function also keeps track of the maximum count of any letter. This is done by comparing the current count with the maximum count, and updating the maximum count if necessary.

Finally, the function uses a list comprehension to create a new dictionary that only includes the letters with the maximum count. This dictionary is then returned.

The function handles the case where multiple letters have the same maximum count by returning a dictionary that includes all of these letters. This is done by creating a list of keys that have the maximum count, and then using a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary that only includes these keys.

The function also handles the case where the input string is empty by returning an empty dictionary. This is done by checking if the input string is empty at the beginning of the function, and returning an empty dictionary if it is.
