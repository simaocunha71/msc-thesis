Explanation:
The function `histogram` takes a string `test` as input, which is a space-separated string of lowercase letters. The function returns a dictionary where the keys are the letters that appear most frequently in the string, and the values are the counts of these letters.

Here's how the function works:

1. If the input string is empty, the function returns an empty dictionary.
2. The input string is split into individual letters using the `split` method.
3. A dictionary `letter_count` is created to store the count of each letter. The initial count is set to 0 for each letter.
4. The function iterates over each letter in the input string. If the letter is already in the `letter_count` dictionary, its count is incremented by 1. If the letter is not in the dictionary, it is added with a count of 1.
5. The function keeps track of the maximum count `max_count` seen so far.
6. The function creates a list `max_letters` of all letters that have the maximum count `max_count`.
7. Finally, the function returns a dictionary where the keys are the letters in `max_letters` and the values are the maximum count `max_count`.

For example, if the input string is `'a b c'`, the function will return `{'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 1}`. If the input string is `'a b b a'`, the function will return `{'a': 2, 'b': 2}`. If the input string is `'b b b b a'`, the function will return `{'b': 4}`. If the input string is empty, the function will return an empty dictionary.
