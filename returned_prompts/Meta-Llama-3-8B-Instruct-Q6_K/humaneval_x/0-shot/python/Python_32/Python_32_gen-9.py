The function `find_zero` is trying to find the root of a polynomial. The method used here is to start with an initial guess, and then iteratively refine this guess until it converges to the root. The initial guess is chosen to be the largest non-zero coefficient divided by the coefficient with the largest exponent.

The function `find_zero` assumes that the input list `xs` represents a polynomial with even number of coefficients, and the largest non-zero coefficient is guaranteed to have a solution.

Here is the corrected code:

```Python
import math

def poly(xs: list, x: float):
    """
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x^2 + .... xs[n] * x^n
    """
    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])

def find_zero(xs: list):
    """ xs are coefficients of a polynomial.
    find_zero find x such that poly(x) = 0.
    find_zero returns only one zero point, even if there are many.
    Moreover, find_zero only takes list xs having even number of coefficients
    and largest non zero coefficient as it guarantees
    a solution.
    """
    if len(xs) % 2 == 0:  # check if the number of coefficients is even
        raise ValueError("The number of coefficients must be odd.")
    max_coeff = max([abs(coeff) for coeff in xs])  # find the largest non-zero coefficient
    max_coeff_index = xs.index(max_coeff)  # find the index of the largest non-zero coefficient
    x0 = max_coeff / xs[max_coeff_index - 1]  # initial guess
    for _ in range(1000):  # iterate 1000 times
        x1 = x0 - poly(xs, x0) / poly([1] + [i * x0 for i in xs[1:]], x0)  # refine the guess
        if abs(x1 - x0) < 1e-6:  # check for convergence
            return round(x1, 2)
        x0 = x1
    raise ValueError("No root found.")
```

This code works by iteratively refining an initial guess for the root of the polynomial. The initial guess is chosen to be the largest non-zero coefficient divided by the coefficient with the largest exponent. The refinement is done
