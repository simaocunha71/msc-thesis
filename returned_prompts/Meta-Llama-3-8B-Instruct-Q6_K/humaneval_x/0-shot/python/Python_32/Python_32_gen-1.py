In this code, we first check if the list of coefficients has an even number of elements and if the largest non-zero coefficient is not zero. Then, we use the Newton-Raphson method to find the root of the polynomial. The Newton-Raphson method is an iterative method that starts with an initial guess and updates the guess until the convergence is reached. In this code, we use a maximum of 100 iterations and a convergence tolerance of 1e-
