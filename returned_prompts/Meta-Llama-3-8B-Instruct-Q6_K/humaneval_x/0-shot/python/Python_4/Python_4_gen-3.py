from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    return sum(abs(num - mean) for num in numbers) / len(numbers)
    # or, more concisely:
    # return sum(abs(num - sum(numbers) / len(numbers)) for num in numbers) / len(numbers)
    # or, using numpy:
    # import numpy as np
    # return np.mean(np.abs(np.array(numbers) - np.mean(numbers)))  # requires numpy
    # or, using statistics module
    # import statistics
    # return statistics.mean([abs(num - mean) for num in numbers])  # requires Python 3.4 or later
    # or, using math module
    # import math
    # return sum(math.fabs(num - mean) for num in numbers) / len(numbers)
    # ...and many more ways to do this. This is just one example.
    # You can also add some error checking, like checking if the list is empty,
    # or if the mean is zero, or if the MAD is zero, etc. 
    # It's up to you how much error checking you want to do.
    # Also, you can add some docstrings to explain what your function does,
    # and what it returns.
    # You can also add some unit tests to make sure your function works correctly.
    # And so on... 
    # This is just a simple example, and you can make it more complex or more 
    # robust as needed. 
    # For example, you could add some checks to make sure the input is a list,
    # or that the list is not empty, etc. 
    # You could also add some logging, or some other features as needed. 
    # The possibilities are endless! 
    # Just remember, the goal is to make your code easy to understand,
    # easy to use, and easy to maintain. 
    # And to make sure it works correctly, of course! 
    # And to make sure it's efficient, and scalable, and all that good stuff! 
    # And to make sure it's well-documented, and easy to test, etc. 
    # And so on... 
    # But I digress... 
    # The point is, you can make your code as complex or as simple as you want,
    # depending on your needs, and your
