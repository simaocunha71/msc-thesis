Here is the code for Mean Absolute Deviation in Python:

1.  Calculate the mean of the input numbers.
2.  Calculate the absolute deviations from the mean.
3.  Calculate the mean of the absolute deviations.

The Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) is the average absolute difference between each element and a centerpoint (mean in this case). It's a measure of the spread or volatility of a dataset. The MAD is a simple and robust measure that can be used in a wide range of applications, from finance to biology.

Here's an example usage of the `mean_absolute_deviation` function:

```python
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
print(mean_absolute_deviation(numbers))  # Output: 1.0
```

In this example, the input list of numbers is `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]`. The function calculates the mean of these numbers, which is `(1.0 + 2.0 + 3.0 + 4.0) / 4 = 2.5`. Then, it calculates the absolute deviations from the mean: `|1.0 - 2.5| = 1.5`, `|2.0 - 2.5| = 0.5`, `|3.
