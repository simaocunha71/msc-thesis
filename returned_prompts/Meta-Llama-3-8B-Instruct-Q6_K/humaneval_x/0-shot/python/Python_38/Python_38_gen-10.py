Explanation:
The provided solution is a correct implementation of the encode_cyclic and decode_cyclic functions. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

encode_cyclic function:

1. It splits the input string into groups of three characters using list comprehension. If the string length is not a multiple of 3, the last group will have fewer elements.
2. It cycles the elements in each group by taking the last element of the group, moving it to the beginning, and then joining the remaining elements in the original order. This is done using a conditional expression inside the list comprehension.
3. Finally, it joins the modified groups into a single string using the join method.

decode_cyclic function:

1. It splits the input string into groups of three characters using list comprehension. If the string length is not a multiple of 3, the last group will have fewer elements.
2. It reverses the cycling operation done in the encode_cyclic function. Specifically, it takes the first element of the group, moves it to the end, and then joins the remaining elements in the original order. This is done using a conditional expression inside the list comprehension.
3. Finally, it joins the modified groups into a single string using the join method.

The decode_cyclic function is the inverse of the encode_cyclic function, and it can be used to recover the original string from the encoded string.
