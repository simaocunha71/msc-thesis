Note: The solution is based on the understanding that the encode_cyclic function cycles the groups of three characters in the string. If a group has fewer than three characters, it is appended to the result as it is. The decode_cyclic function reverses this process by extracting the first and second characters from each group and appending them together. If a group has fewer than three characters, it is appended to the result as it is. 

The provided code has been modified to correctly implement the encode_cyclic and decode_cyclic functions. The encode_cyclic function now iterates over the string in steps of 3, and for each group of 3 characters, it checks if the group has 3 characters. If it does, it cycles the group by moving the first character to the end. If the group has fewer than 3 characters, it appends the group as it is. The decode_cyclic function does the opposite, it extracts the first and second characters from each group and appends them together. If a group has fewer than 3 characters, it appends the group as it is. 

The time complexity of both functions is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, as they both iterate over the string once. The space complexity is O(n), as they both store the result in a string. 

The encode_cyclic function can be used to encode a string by cycling the groups of three characters, and the decode_cyclic function can be used to decode a string that was encoded with the encode_cyclic function. 

The provided test cases can be used to verify the correctness of the functions. For example, the test case "
