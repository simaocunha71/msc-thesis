    The provided code defines two functions, `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic`, which are used to encode and decode a string by cycling groups of three characters.

    The `encode_cyclic` function splits the input string into groups of three characters or fewer, then cycles each group by moving the first character to the end of the group. If a group has fewer than three characters, it is left unchanged.

    The `decode_cyclic` function is the inverse of `encode_cyclic`. It splits the input string into groups of three characters or fewer, then decodes each group by moving the last character to the front of the group. If a group has fewer than three characters, it is left unchanged.

    These functions can be used to create a simple form of encryption and decryption. For example, the string "hello" could be encoded as "elloh" and then decoded back to "hello". However, this is not a secure method of encryption and should not be used for sensitive data.
