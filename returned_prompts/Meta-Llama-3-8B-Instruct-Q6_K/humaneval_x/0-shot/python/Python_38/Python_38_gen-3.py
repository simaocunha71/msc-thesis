Explanation:
The `encode_cyclic` function takes a string and splits it into groups of three characters. If a group has fewer characters than three, it remains unchanged. Otherwise, it cycles the characters by moving the first character to the end of the group. The `decode_cyclic` function works in reverse. It takes an encoded string, splits it into groups of three characters, and cycles the characters by moving the first character to the end of the group. The decoded groups are then joined together to form the original string. The `decode_cyclic` function handles strings that were encoded with the `encode_cyclic` function. It can correctly decode these strings by reversing the cycling operation performed by `encode_cyclic`. This means that if a group had fewer characters than three, it will remain unchanged in the decoded string.
