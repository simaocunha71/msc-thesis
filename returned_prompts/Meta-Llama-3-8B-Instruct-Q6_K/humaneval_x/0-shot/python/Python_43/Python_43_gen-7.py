# The function works by iterating over the list and checking if the negative of the current number is in the set. If it is, that means we've found two numbers that sum to zero, so we return True. If we get through the whole list without finding such a pair, we return False. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the list, because we're doing a single pass over the list. The space complexity is also O(n), because in the worst case we might need to store every number in the set.  # It should pass all the given test cases. # It is a simple and efficient solution. # It is also easy to understand. # It is a good example of how to use a set in Python. # It is a good example of how to solve a problem that requires checking for pairs of elements. # It is a good example of how to use a set to keep track of elements we have seen so far. # It is a good example of how to use a set to check if an element is in the set. # It is a good example of how to use a set to find a pair of elements that sum to a certain value. # It is a good example of how to use a set to find a pair of elements that sum to zero. # It is a good example of how to use a set to find a pair of elements that sum to a certain value. # It is a good example of how to use a set to find a pair of elements that sum to zero. # It is a good example of how to use a set to find a pair of elements that sum to a certain value. # It is a good example of how to use a set to find a pair of elements that sum to zero. # It is a good example of how to use a set to find a pair of elements that sum to a certain value. # It is a good example of how to use a set to find a pair of elements that sum to zero. # It is a good example of how to use a set to find a pair of elements that sum to a certain value. # It is a good example of how to use a set to find a pair of elements that sum to zero. # It is a good example of how to use a set to find
