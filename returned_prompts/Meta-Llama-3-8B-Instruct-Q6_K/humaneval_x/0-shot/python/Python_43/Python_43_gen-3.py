    # Explanation:
    # This function iterates over the list, and for each number, it checks if the negative of that number is in the set.
    # If it is, it means that the sum of these two numbers is zero, so it returns True.
    # If it doesn't find such a pair, it returns False.
    # The set is used to store the numbers we have seen so far, with the advantage that lookups are O(1) on average.
    # This is because the time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the list. 
    # This is because we are doing a single pass over the list, and each operation (adding to the set or checking if a number is in the set) takes constant time. 
    # So, the time complexity is linear, which is the best we can do for this problem. 
    # The space complexity is also O(n), because in the worst case, we have to store all the numbers in the set.  #
