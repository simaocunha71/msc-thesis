Explanation:

The function `count_upper(s)` takes a string `s` as input and returns the count of uppercase vowels in even indices.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the function works:

1. Initialize a variable `count` to 0, which will be used to count the number of uppercase vowels.
2. Use a for loop to iterate over the indices of the string `s` in steps of 2 (i.e., even indices).
3. For each even index `i`, check if the character at that index is an uppercase vowel using the `upper()` method and the `in` operator. If it is, increment the `count` variable.
4. After the loop finishes, return the final value of `count`.

The function uses the `range()` function to generate the indices of the string in steps of 2, starting from 0. This ensures that only even indices are considered.

The `if` statement checks if the character at the current index is an uppercase vowel by converting it to uppercase using the `upper()` method and checking if it is in the string 'AEIOU'. If it is, the `count` variable is incremented.

Finally, the function returns the final value of `count`, which represents the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.
