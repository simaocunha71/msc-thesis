Explanation:
The function `do_algebra` takes two lists as input: `operator` and `operand`. The function first checks if the length of the `operator` list is equal to the length of the `operand` list minus one. If not, it raises a `ValueError`. It also checks if the length of the `operand` list is at least two. If not, it raises a `ValueError`. Finally, it checks if all elements in the `operand` list are non-negative integers. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.

Then, the function initializes a variable `result` with the first element of the `operand` list. It then iterates over the `operator` list and the `operand` list (starting from the second element of the `operand` list). For each operator, it performs the corresponding operation on the `result` and the next operand. Finally, it returns the `result`.

Note that the function uses the `**=` operator to perform exponentiation, which is a shorthand for `result = result ** operand[i + 1]`. Similarly, it uses the `//=` operator to perform floor division. If you want to use the traditional `int(result / operand[i + 1])` syntax instead, you can modify the function accordingly.
