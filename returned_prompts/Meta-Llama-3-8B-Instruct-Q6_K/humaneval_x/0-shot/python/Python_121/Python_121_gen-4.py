    def solution(lst):
        return sum(x for i, x in enumerate(lst) if i % 2 == 0 and x % 2 != 0)  # your code here
    print(solution([5, 8, 7, 1]))  # prints 12
    print(solution([3, 3, 3, 3, 3]))  # prints 9
    print(solution([30, 13, 24, 321]))  # prints 0
    print(solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # prints 9

This problem is asking to calculate the sum of all the odd elements that are in even positions in the given list. 

The function solution(lst) will iterate over the list using the enumerate function, which returns both the index and the value of each element. It will check if the index is even (i % 2 == 0) and if the value is odd (x % 2 != 0), and if both conditions are met, it will add the value to the sum.

The examples given are: 
- solution([5, 8, 7, 1]) returns 12, because the odd elements in even positions are 5 and 7, and their sum is 12.
- solution([3, 3, 3, 3, 3]) returns 9, because all the elements are odd and are in even positions, so their sum is 9.
- solution([30, 13, 24, 321]) returns 0, because there are no odd elements in even positions.
- solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) returns 9, because the odd elements in even positions are 3 and 5, and their sum is 9.  # coding challenge: "Sum of odd elements in even positions"  # coding challenge: "Sum of odd elements in even positions"  # coding challenge: "Sum of odd elements in even positions"  # coding challenge: "Sum of odd elements in even positions"  # coding challenge: "Sum of odd elements in even positions"  # coding challenge: "Sum of odd elements in even positions"  # coding challenge: "Sum of odd elements in even positions"  # coding challenge: "Sum of odd elements in even positions"  # coding challenge: "Sum of odd elements in even positions"  #
