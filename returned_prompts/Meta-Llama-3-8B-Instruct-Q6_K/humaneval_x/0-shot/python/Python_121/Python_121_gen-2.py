```


Explanation:
The task is to find the sum of all odd numbers in the list that are in even positions. We can achieve this by using a list comprehension. The list comprehension will iterate through each element in the list and check if the element is odd and its position in the list is even. If both conditions are met, the element is added to the sum. The index() method is used to find the position of the element in the list. The % operator is used to find the remainder of the division of the position and 2, which will be 0 for even positions. 

For example, for the list [5, 8, 7, 1], the odd numbers in even positions are 5 and 7, and their sum is 12. For the list [3, 3, 3, 3, 3], the odd numbers in even positions are 3, and their sum is 9. For the list [30, 13, 24, 321], there are no odd numbers in even positions, so the sum is 0. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the list, because it needs to iterate through each element in the list once. The space complexity is O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the sum.
