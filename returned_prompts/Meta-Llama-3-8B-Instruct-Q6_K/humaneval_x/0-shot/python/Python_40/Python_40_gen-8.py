# This function takes a list of integers and returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and False otherwise. It sorts the list first, and then uses two pointers (left and right) to find a triplet that sums to zero. If it finds a triplet that sums to zero, it returns True. If it doesn't find a triplet that sums to zero after checking all possible triplets, it returns False. This function runs in O(n^2) time, where n is the length of the input list.  # This function takes a list of integers and returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and False otherwise.
