Explanation:

This function takes a list of integers as input and checks if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero.

First, it checks if the length of the list is less than 3. If it is, it returns False because there can't be three distinct elements in a list of less than 3 elements that sum to zero.

Next, it creates a set called num_set to store the numbers in the list.

Then, it iterates over the list. For each number, it checks if the negative of that number is in num_set. If it is, it means that there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, so it returns True.

If it doesn't find any such triplet, it adds the current number to num_set and continues iterating over the list.

If it finishes iterating over the list without finding any triplet that sums to zero, it returns False.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the list, because it needs to iterate over the list once. The space complexity is also O(n), because in the worst case, it needs to store all the numbers in the list in the set.
