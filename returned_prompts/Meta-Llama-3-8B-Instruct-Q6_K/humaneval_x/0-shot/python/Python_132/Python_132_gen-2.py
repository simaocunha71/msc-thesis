The problem is asking you to create a function that takes a string of square brackets as input and returns True if the string contains a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket in the subsequence is nested, and False otherwise.

Here is the solution:

```
def is_nested(string):
    stack = []
    for char in string:
        if char == '[':
            stack.append(char)
        elif char == ']':
            if not stack:
                return False
            stack.pop()
    return bool(stack)
```

Explanation:

* We use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets.
* We iterate over the string. If we encounter an opening bracket, we push it onto the stack.
* If we encounter a closing bracket, we check if the stack is empty. If it is, it means there is no matching opening bracket, so we return False. If the stack is not empty, we pop the opening bracket from the stack.
* After iterating over the entire string, we check if the stack is empty. If it is, it means all brackets were properly matched, so we return False. If the stack is not empty, it means there were unmatched opening brackets, so we return True.

Note that the function returns True only if there is at least one bracket in the subsequence that is nested. If the entire string consists of properly matched brackets, the function returns False.
