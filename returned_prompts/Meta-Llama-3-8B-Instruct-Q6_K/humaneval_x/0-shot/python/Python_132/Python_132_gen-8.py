Explanation:
The function `is_nested` takes a string as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether there is a valid subsequence of nested brackets in the string.

The function uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening and closing brackets. When an opening bracket `[` is encountered, it is pushed onto the stack. When a closing bracket `]` is encountered, the function checks if the stack is not empty. If the stack is not empty, the top element (the opening bracket) is popped from the stack. If the stack is empty, it means there is no matching opening bracket for the closing bracket, so the function returns `False`.

After processing the entire string, the function checks if the stack is not empty. If the stack is not empty, it means there are unmatched opening brackets, so the function returns `True`. If the stack is empty, it means all brackets have been matched, so the function returns `False`.

The function `is_nested` is then tested with different input strings to verify its correctness. For example, the input string `'[[]]'` returns `True` because there is a valid subsequence of nested brackets. The input string `'[]]]]]]][[[[[]'` returns `False` because there are no nested brackets. The input string `'[][]'` returns `False` because there are no nested brackets. The input string `'[]'` returns `False` because there are no nested brackets. The input string `'[[][]]'` returns `True` because there is a valid subsequence of nested brackets. The input string `'[[]][['` returns `True` because there is a valid subsequence of nested brackets.
