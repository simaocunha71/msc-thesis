    # Alternative solution:

    # This solution adds the delimeter after the last element if the input list is not empty
    # and returns an empty list if the input list is empty.
    # However, this solution does not provide the desired output for the test case intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4) 
    # as it will result in [1, 2, 4, 3] instead of [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]. The original solution is more accurate. 
    # The original solution also handles the case where the input list is empty correctly. 
    # The alternative solution does not handle this case correctly. 
    # Therefore, the original solution is more robust and accurate. 
    # It also provides the correct output for the test case intersperse([], 4) which is an empty list. 
    # The alternative solution will return [4] instead of an empty list. 
    # This is because the alternative solution does not handle the case where the input list is empty correctly.
