            return True  # If two numbers are closer than the threshold, return True
    return False  # If no two numbers are closer than the threshold, return False
# Example usage:
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))  # False
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))  # True
# Output:
# False
# True
# This function sorts the list of numbers and then checks for each pair of adjacent numbers if they are closer than the given threshold. If it finds any pair that is closer than the threshold, it returns True. If it checks all pairs and doesn't find any that are closer than the threshold, it returns False. This function will return True if and only if there are two numbers in the list that are closer than the threshold. It does not matter if there are more numbers that are closer than the threshold, it only checks for the existence of at least one pair that is closer than the threshold.
