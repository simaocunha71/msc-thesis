# You can also test with random inputs to see how your function behaves. 
# Make sure your function can handle different types of inputs (like negative numbers, 
# floats, lists with different lengths, etc.) and edge cases (like an empty list, 
# a list with one element, etc.) 
# You can also test the function with different thresholds to see how it works. 
# This will help you ensure that your function is robust and works correctly in different scenarios. 
# It's also a good idea to test the function with different inputs that are known to work correctly, 
# as well as with inputs that are known to cause errors. 
# This will help you ensure that your function is reliable and works correctly in different situations.
