    return max(l)

# Python built-in function max() is used to find the maximum element in the list.
# It takes a list as an argument and returns the maximum element. 

# For example, if we have a list [1, 2, 3], the max() function will return 3.
# If we have a list [5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10], the max() function will return 123. 

# The max() function is a built-in function in Python and can be used with any type of iterable, not just lists.
# For example, you can use it with a tuple, a string, or even a set. 

# Here's an example of using max() with a tuple:
# >>> max((1, 2, 3, 4, 5))
# 5

# Here's an example of using max() with a string:
# >>> max('hello world')
# 'w'

# And here's an example of using max() with a set:
# >>> max({1, 2, 3, 4, 5})
# 5

# The max() function is a very useful function in Python, and it can be used in a wide range of situations. 

# It's worth noting that the max() function can also take a key argument, which allows you to specify a function to use to determine the maximum element. 
# For example:
# >>> max([1, 2, 3], key=lambda x: x**2)
# 3

# This would return the maximum element in the list, but instead of comparing the elements directly, it would compare the squares of the elements. 
# This can be very useful in certain situations, such as when you need to find the maximum value in a list of complex numbers. 

# I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions. 

# Here is the code again:
# def max_element(l: list):
#     return max(l) 

# You can use this function to find the maximum element in a list. For example:
# >>> max_element([1, 2, 3])
# 3 

# I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
