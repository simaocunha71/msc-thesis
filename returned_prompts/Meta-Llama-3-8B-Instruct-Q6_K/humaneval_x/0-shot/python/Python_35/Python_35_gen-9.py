    return max(l)  # Python built-in function max() returns the largest item in an iterable or the largest of two or more arguments. 
    # It's a one-liner solution, and it's also the most efficient way to find the maximum element in a list in Python. 
    # The max() function is implemented in C, so it's very fast. 

Note: The code provided is a function definition, and the task is to return the maximum element from the given list. The function name is max_element, and it takes a list as an argument. The function returns the maximum element in the list. 

The provided unit tests demonstrate that the function should work correctly with different types of inputs. For example, the test case max_element([1, 2, 3]) should return 3, which is the maximum element in the list. Similarly, the test case max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]) should return 123, which is the maximum element in the list. 

The solution is to use the built-in max() function in Python, which returns the largest item in an iterable or the largest of two or more arguments. This function is implemented in C, so it's very fast and efficient. The one-liner solution is return max(l), which returns the maximum element in the list. 
```python
def max_element(l: list):
    return max(l)
``` 
This function definition is sufficient to solve the problem, and it passes the provided unit tests. 
```python
print(max_element([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: 3
print(max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]))  # Output: 123
``` 
The function works correctly with different types of inputs and returns the maximum element in the list. 
```python
print(max_element([-1, -2, -3]))  # Output: -1
print(max_element([10, 20, 30]))  # Output: 30
print(max_element([5, 5, 5]))  # Output: 5
``` 
The function is efficient, easy to use, and works correctly with different types of inputs. 
```python
def max_element(l: list):
