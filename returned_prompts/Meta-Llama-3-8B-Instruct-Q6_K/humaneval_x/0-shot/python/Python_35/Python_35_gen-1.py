```
def max_element(l: list):
    return max(l)
```
This function takes a list `l` as an argument, and returns the maximum element in the list. The `max` function is used to find the maximum element in the list. This function is defined in the `functools` module, but it is also available as a built-in function in Python.

The unit tests provided show that the function should work correctly for lists with different lengths and containing different types of numbers. For example, the test `>>> max_element([1, 2, 3])` checks that the function returns the maximum element in a list of three integers, while the test `>>> max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])` checks that the function returns the maximum element in a list of eleven integers.

This function is a simple and efficient way to find the maximum element in a list. It has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the list, because it needs to iterate over the entire list to find the maximum element. It is also a linear function, which means that it has a constant time complexity for lists of a fixed size. Therefore, it is suitable for use in a wide range of applications, from small lists to large datasets.
