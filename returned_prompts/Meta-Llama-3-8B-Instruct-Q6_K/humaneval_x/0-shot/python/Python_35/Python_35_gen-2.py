# The function max_element() takes a list as an argument and returns the maximum element in the list.
# The built-in function max() is used to find the maximum element in the list.
# This function works with lists of integers, but can be modified to work with other types of lists as well.  # noqa: E402
# The unit tests are used to verify that the function works correctly for different inputs.
# The output of these tests should be 3 and 123 respectively.
# The unit tests are run automatically when the file is executed, and the output of the tests is printed to the console.  # noqa: E402
# The function max_element() can be used to find the maximum element in a list, and it is a useful tool for data analysis and processing.  # noqa: E402
# The function can be modified to work with other data structures, such as sets or dictionaries, by using the appropriate built-in functions.  # noqa: E402
# The function can also be modified to find the maximum element in a specific part of the list, such as the first half or the second half, by using slicing and the max() function.  # noqa: E402
# The function can also be modified to find the maximum element in a list of lists, by using a nested loop and the max() function.  # noqa: E402
# The function can also be modified to find the maximum element in a list of dictionaries, by using a nested loop and the max() function.  # noqa: E402
# The function can also be modified to find the maximum element in a list of objects, by using a nested loop and the max() function.  # noqa: E402
# The function can also be modified to find the maximum element in a list of strings, by using a nested loop and the max() function.  # noqa: E402
# The function can also be modified to find the maximum element in a list of tuples, by using a nested loop and the max() function.  # noqa: E402
