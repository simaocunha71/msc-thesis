The function takes two planet names as strings and returns a tuple containing all planets whose orbits are located between the orbit of planet1 and the orbit of planet2, sorted by the proximity to the sun. If the input planet names are not correct, the function returns an empty tuple.

Here is the Python code for the function:

```
def bf(planet1, planet2):
    planets = ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']
    planet1_index = planets.index(planet1)
    planet2_index = planets.index(planet2)
    
    if planet1_index == -1 or planet2_index == -1:
        return ()
    
    result = planets[planet1_index+1:planet2_index]
    return tuple(result)
```

Here's an explanation of the code:

1. The function takes two planet names as strings, planet1 and planet2.
2. The list of planets is defined.
3. The index of planet1 and planet2 in the list of planets is found using the index() method.
4. If either planet1 or planet2 is not found in the list of planets, the function returns an empty tuple.
5. The result is calculated by slicing the list of planets from the index of planet1 + 1 to the index of planet2.
6. The result is returned as a tuple.

The function works by finding the index of each planet in the list and then slicing the list to get the planets between the two input planets. If the input planets are not correct, the function returns an empty tuple. The result is returned as a tuple, which is a collection of values that can be used in various ways.
