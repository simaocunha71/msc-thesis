The solution to this problem involves iterating over the list of planets and checking if the planet is between planet1 and planet2. The planets should be returned in the order of their proximity to the sun.

Here is the Python code for the solution:
```
def bf(planet1, planet2):
    planets = ["Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus", "Neptune"]
    if planet1 not in planets or planet2 not in planets:
        return ()
    index1 = planets.index(planet1)
    index2 = planets.index(planet2)
    if index1 > index2:
        index1, index2 = index2, index1
    return tuple(planets[index1+1:index2])

# Test cases
print(bf("Jupiter", "Neptune"))  # ("Saturn", "Uranus")
print(bf("Earth", "Mercury"))  # ("Venus")
print(bf("Mercury", "Uranus"))  # ("Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn")
```
In this code, we first define a list of planets. Then, we check if the input planets are valid by checking if they are in the list. If they are not, we return an empty tuple. If they are, we find their indices in the list and swap them if necessary. Finally, we return a tuple of planets from index1+1 to index2, which are the planets whose orbits are between the orbits of planet1 and planet2. The planets are returned in the order of their proximity to the sun.
