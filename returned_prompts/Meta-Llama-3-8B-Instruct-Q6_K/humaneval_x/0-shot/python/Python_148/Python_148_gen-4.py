```
def bf(planet1, planet2):
    planets = ["Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus", "Neptune"]
    planets.sort()
    if planet1 not in planets or planet2 not in planets:
        return ()
    index1 = planets.index(planet1)
    index2 = planets.index(planet2)
    if index2 < index1:
        index2 += 1
    return tuple(planets[index1:index2])
```


The code defines a function `bf(planet1, planet2)` that takes two planet names as strings. It first defines the list of planets and sorts it. Then, it checks if both planet1 and planet2 are in the list of planets. If not, it returns an empty tuple.

Next, it finds the indices of planet1 and planet2 in the list of planets. If planet2 is before planet1 in the list, it increments the index of planet2 by 1.

Finally, it returns a tuple containing all planets whose orbits are located between the orbit of planet1 and the orbit of planet2, sorted by proximity to the sun. The `index` method is used to find the indices of planet1 and planet2, and slicing is used to extract the relevant planets from the list. The `sort` method is used to sort the planets by proximity to the sun. The function returns an empty tuple if planet1 or planet2 are not correct planet names.
