The function `bf(planet1, planet2)` takes two planet names as input and returns a tuple of planets whose orbits are located between the orbit of `planet1` and the orbit of `planet2`. If `planet1` or `planet2` are not correct planet names, it returns an empty tuple.

Here is the Python code for the function:

```Python
def bf(planet1, planet2):
    planets = ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']
    planet1_index = planets.index(planet1)
    planet2_index = planets.index(planet2)

    if planet1_index == -1 or planet2_index == -1:
        return ()

    planets_between = planets[planet1_index + 1:planet2_index]
    return tuple(sorted(planets_between))
```

Here's how the function works:

- It first defines a list of all the planets in our solar system.
- It then finds the index of `planet1` and `planet2` in the list of planets.
- If either `planet1` or `planet2` is not a correct planet name, their index will be -1, and the function returns an empty tuple.
- If both `planet1` and `planet2` are correct planet names, the function returns a tuple of planets whose orbits are located between the orbit of `planet1` and the orbit of `planet2`. It does this by slicing the list of planets from `planet1_index + 1` to `planet2_index`, and then sorting the resulting list and converting it to a tuple.

Here are some examples of how the function works:

- `bf("Jupiter", "Neptune")` returns `('Saturn', 'Uranus')`.
- `bf("Earth", "Mercury")` returns `
