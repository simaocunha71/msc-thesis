The provided solution defines a function `select_words` that takes a string `s` and an integer `n` as input. The function returns a list of all words from the input string `s` that contain exactly `n` consonants. The function works by first splitting the input string into a list of words using the `split` method. Then, it iterates over each word in the list and counts the number of consonants in the word. If the word contains exactly `n` consonants, it is added to the result list. Finally, the function returns the result list.

Here's a breakdown of the solution:
```
def select_words(s, n):
    # Split the input string into a list of words
    words = s.split()
    
    # Initialize an empty list to store the result
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over each word in the list
    for word in words:
        # Initialize a counter for consonants
        consonants = 0
        
        # Iterate over each character in the word
        for char in word:
            # Check if the character is a consonant (not a vowel)
            if char.lower() not in 'aeiou':
                # Increment the consonant counter
                consonants += 1
        
        # Check if the word contains exactly n consonants
        if consonants == n:
            # Add the word to the result list
            result.append(word)
    
    # Return the result list
    return result
```
The solution uses the following techniques:
* String splitting: The `split` method is used to split the input string into a list of words.
* Looping: The function uses a loop to iterate over each word in the list.
* Conditional statements: The function uses an if statement to check if the word contains exactly `n` consonants.
* String manipulation: The function uses the `lower` method to convert the character to lowercase and the `in` operator to check if the character is a vowel.
* List manipulation: The function uses the `append` method to add words to the result list. A: The provided
