# Code Explanation:
The function select_words takes two parameters: a string s and a natural number n. It first splits the string into a list of words using the split() method. Then it iterates over each word in the list. For each word, it counts the number of consonants by iterating over each character in the word and checking if it is not in the string 'aeiou' (ignoring case). If the number of consonants is equal to n, it adds the word to the result list. Finally, it returns the result list.

The function is case-insensitive, meaning it treats uppercase and lowercase letters as the same. It also ignores punctuation and special characters, as they are not considered part of the word. The function works correctly even if the input string is empty, in which case it returns an empty list.
