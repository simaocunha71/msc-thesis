# Explanation:
# This function iterates over each character in the input string. When it encounters an open parenthesis '(', it adds it to a temporary string. When it encounters a close parenthesis ')', it adds it to the temporary string and appends the temporary string to the result list, then resets the temporary string. This way, each group of balanced parentheses is treated as a separate string. The result list is then returned. 

# For example, in the input string '( ) (( )) (( )( ))', the function first encounters '(', which is added to the temporary string. Then it encounters ')', which is also added to the temporary string. This forms the first group '()'. Then it encounters '(', which is added to the temporary string. Then it encounters '(', which is added to the temporary string. Then it encounters ')', which is also added to the temporary string. This forms the second group '(())'. Then it encounters '(', which is added to the temporary string. Then it encounters '(', which is added to the temporary string. Then it encounters ')', which is also added to the temporary string. Then it encounters ')', which is also added to the temporary string. This forms the third group '(()())'. The function then returns the result list ['()', '(())', '(()())'].  # noqa: E501
# The function correctly handles spaces in the input string by ignoring them. It also correctly handles groups of parentheses that are not separated by spaces. 
# The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because it iterates over each character in the string once. The space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of groups of parentheses in the input string, because it stores the groups in a list.  # noqa: E501
# The function assumes that the input string is valid, meaning that each group of parentheses is balanced and not nested within each other. If the input string is not valid, the function may not
