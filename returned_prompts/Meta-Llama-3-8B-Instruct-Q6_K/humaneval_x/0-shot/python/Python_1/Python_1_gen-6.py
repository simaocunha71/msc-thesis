This Python function separates a string of parentheses into a list of separate groups. Each group is a string of parentheses that is balanced, meaning every open parenthesis is properly closed. The function ignores any spaces in the input string and does not nest parentheses within each other. It uses a list to store the separated groups and a string to build the current group. It iterates over each character in the input string and appends the current group to the list of separated groups when a close parenthesis is encountered. The function then returns the list of separated groups. The test case provided shows that the function correctly separates the input string into a list of separate groups. 





This is a solution to a programming problem where the task is to separate a string of parentheses into a list of separate groups. Each group is a string of parentheses that is balanced, meaning every open parenthesis is properly closed. The function ignores any spaces in the input string and does not nest parentheses within each other. It uses a list to store the separated groups and a string to build the current group. It iterates over each character in the input string and appends the current group to the list of separated groups when a close parenthesis is encountered.
