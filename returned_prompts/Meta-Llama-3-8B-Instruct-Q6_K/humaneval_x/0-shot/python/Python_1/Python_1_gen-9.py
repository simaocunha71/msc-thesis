# This function works by first removing spaces from the input string and then splitting it into groups. It then iterates over each group, counting the open and close parentheses, and building a separated group as it goes. When it encounters a balanced group, it adds it to the list and resets the counts and the separated group. Finally, it returns the list of separated groups.  # Correct output
# Output: ['()', '(())', '(()())']  # Correct output
