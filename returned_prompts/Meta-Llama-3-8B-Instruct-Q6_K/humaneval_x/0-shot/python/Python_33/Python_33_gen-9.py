    l = l.copy()  # Create a copy of the list
    l[1::3] = sorted(l[1::3])  # Sort the elements at the indices that are divisible by three
    return l  # Return the modified list

This function works by first creating a copy of the list l. Then, it uses list slicing to select the elements at the indices that are divisible by three, sorts them, and assigns them back to the corresponding indices in the list. Finally, it returns the modified list. The unit tests provided show the expected behavior of the function. For example, the test `sort_third([1, 2, 3])` checks that the function leaves the list unchanged when there are no elements at indices divisible by three. The test `sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])` checks that the function correctly sorts the elements at the indices that are divisible by three.
