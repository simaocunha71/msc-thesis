The function `sort_third` is implemented as follows:

```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    l_prime = []
    for i, val in enumerate(l):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            l_prime.append(sorted([x for x in l if x % 3 == 0]))
        else:
            l_prime.append(val)
    return l_prime
```

This function uses list comprehension to generate a list of values at the indices that are divisible by three, sorts this list, and appends it to `l_prime`. For the other indices, it simply appends the corresponding value from `l`. The result is a list `l_prime` that is identical to `l` in the indices that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal to the values of the corresponding indices of `l`, but sorted.
