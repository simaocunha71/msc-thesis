This problem is asking you to create a function that takes a list as an input and returns a new list. The new list will be the same as the original list, but with the elements at the indices that are divisible by 3, sorted in ascending order.

Here is the Python function that solves this problem:

```
def sort_third(l: list):
    return [x if i % 3 != 0 else sorted([x])[0] for i, x in enumerate(l)]
```

This function uses a list comprehension to create the new list. It iterates over the input list `l` with the `enumerate` function, which returns a tuple containing the index `i` and the value `x` of each element. If the index `i` is not divisible by 3 (`i % 3 != 0`), the function keeps the original value `x`. If the index `i` is divisible by 3, the function sorts the list containing `x` and takes the first element (which is the smallest) as the new value. The function returns the new list.
