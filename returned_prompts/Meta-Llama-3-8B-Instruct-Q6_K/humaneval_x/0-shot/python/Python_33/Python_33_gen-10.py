    # The list comprehension iterates over the list l and checks if the index i is divisible by 3.
    # If it is, it sorts the list of values at that index and keeps the first one; if not, it keeps the original value.
    # The result is a new list l' where the values at indices divisible by 3 are sorted, and those not divisible by 3 are unchanged.
