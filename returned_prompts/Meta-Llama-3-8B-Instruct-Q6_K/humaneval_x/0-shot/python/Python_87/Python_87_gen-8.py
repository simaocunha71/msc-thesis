The function `get_row` takes a 2D list `lst` and an integer `x` as input. It iterates over the list and checks each element to see if it equals `x`. If it does, it adds the row and column indices of that element to the result list. Finally, it sorts the result list based on the row index and column index, with the row index as the primary sort key and the column index as the secondary sort key in descending order. This is done using the `sort` method and a lambda function as the `key` argument.

Here is the Python code for the function:
```
def get_row(lst, x):
    result = []
    for i, row in enumerate(lst):
        for j, val in enumerate(row):
            if val == x:
                result.append((i, j))
    result.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    return result
```
This function works by iterating over the 2D list and checking each element to see if it equals `x`. If it does, it adds the row and column indices of that element to the result list. The `enumerate` function is used to get both the index and value of each element in the list.

The `sort` method is then used to sort the result list based on the row index and column index. The `key` argument of the `sort` method is a lambda function that takes a tuple as input and returns a tuple. The first element of the returned tuple is the row index, and the second element is the negative of the column index (to sort in descending order). The `sort` method uses this lambda function to determine the sort order of the elements in the list.

Finally, the function returns the sorted result list. This list contains tuples, where each tuple represents a coordinate (row, column) in the original 2D list where the value `x` was found. The coordinates are sorted in ascending order by row index and descending order by column index. A row index of 0 corresponds to the first row of the 2D list, a row index of 1 corresponds to
