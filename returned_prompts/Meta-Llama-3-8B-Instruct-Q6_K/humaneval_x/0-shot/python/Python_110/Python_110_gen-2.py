                if num in lst2:
                    lst1.remove(num)
                    lst2.append(num)

This function first counts the number of even numbers in lst1. If all numbers in lst1 are even, it returns "YES". If not, it iterates over the list again and tries to replace each odd number with an even number from lst2. If it can't find a match, it returns "NO". If it can replace all odd numbers, it returns "YES". 

For example, if we call `exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4])`, it will return "YES" because all numbers in lst1 are even. If we call `exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4])`, it will return "NO" because there is no even number in lst2 to replace the odd numbers in lst1.  If we call `exchange([1, 1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2, 2])`, it will also return "YES" because it can replace all odd numbers in lst1 with even numbers from lst2. 

Note that this function modifies the input lists. If you want to preserve the original lists, you should make copies of them before processing.  Also, this function assumes that the input lists will be non-empty. If you want to handle empty lists, you should add some error checking code.  Finally, this function is not very efficient for large lists because it uses the `remove` method to remove elements from lst1. This method has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the list. If you need a more efficient solution, you should use a different data structure or algorithm.
