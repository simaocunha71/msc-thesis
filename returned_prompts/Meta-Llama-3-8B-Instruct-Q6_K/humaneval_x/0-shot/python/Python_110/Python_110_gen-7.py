The provided function `exchange` takes two lists of numbers, `lst1` and `lst2`, as inputs. It first separates the numbers in `lst1` into two lists: `even_nums` containing all the even numbers and `odd_nums` containing all the odd numbers.

Then, it iterates over the numbers in `lst2`. If it finds an odd number that is currently in `even_nums`, it moves it to `odd_nums`. If it finds an even number that is currently in `odd_nums`, it moves it to `even_nums`.

Finally, it checks if the length of `even_nums` is equal to the length of `lst1`. If it is, it returns "YES", indicating that it is possible to make all the elements of `lst1` even by exchanging elements with `lst2`. Otherwise, it returns "NO".  This approach ensures that the function correctly determines whether it is possible to make all the elements of `lst1` even by exchanging elements with `lst2`.  For example, `exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4])` returns "YES" because it is possible to exchange elements to make `lst1` a list of only even numbers.  On the other hand, `exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4])` returns "NO" because it is not possible to exchange elements to make `lst1` a list of only even numbers.  The function works correctly with non-empty input lists.  For example, `exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4])` returns "YES", and `exchange([
