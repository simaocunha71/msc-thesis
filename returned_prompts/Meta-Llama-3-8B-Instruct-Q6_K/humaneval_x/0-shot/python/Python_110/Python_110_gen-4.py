```
def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    odd_count = lst1.count(1) + lst1.count(3) + lst1.count(5) + lst1.count(7)
    return "YES" if odd_count <= len(lst2) else "NO"
```
This function counts the number of odd numbers in lst1 and compares it to the length of lst2. If the number of odd numbers in lst1 is less than or equal to the length of lst2, then it is possible to exchange elements to make lst1 a list of only even numbers, so the function returns "YES". Otherwise, it returns "NO".  This solution assumes that the input lists will be non-empty.  If the lists can be empty, then you would need to add additional checks for that case.  Also, this solution does not actually exchange elements between the lists, it just checks if it is possible to do so.  If you need to actually exchange elements, then you would need to modify the function to do so.  For example, you could use a loop to iterate over the lists and exchange elements as needed.  Here is an example of how you could do that:
```
def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    for num in lst1[:]:
        if num % 2 != 0:
            if lst2:
                lst1.remove(num)
                lst2.remove(lst2[0])
            else:
                return "NO"
    return "YES"
```
This version of the function actually exchanges elements between the lists to make lst1 a list of only even numbers.  It does this by iterating over a copy of lst1 (using lst1[:] to create the copy), and for each number that is not even, it removes that number from lst1 and the first number from lst2 (if lst2 is not empty).  If lst2 is empty and there are still odd numbers in lst1, then the function returns "NO".  Otherwise, it returns "YES".  This solution assumes that the input lists will be non-empty and that lst2 will always have at least as many elements as lst1.  If these assumptions are not valid, then you would need to add additional checks and modifications to the function.  For example, you could add a check to make sure that lst2 is not empty before trying to remove elements from it, and you could add a loop to iterate over lst2 and remove elements until it is empty.
