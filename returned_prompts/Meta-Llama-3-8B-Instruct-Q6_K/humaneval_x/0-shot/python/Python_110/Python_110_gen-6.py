# Explanation:
# The function exchanges elements between lst1 and lst2 to make lst1 a list of only even numbers.
# It first counts the number of even numbers in lst1 and lst2.
# If the count of even numbers in lst1 is greater than or equal to the count of even numbers in lst2, 
# it means that lst1 can be made into a list of only even numbers by exchanging elements with lst2.
# Otherwise, it is not possible to make lst1 a list of only even numbers.
