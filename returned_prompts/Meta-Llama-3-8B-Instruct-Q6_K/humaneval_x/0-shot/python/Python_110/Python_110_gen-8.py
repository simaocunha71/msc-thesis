Here is the code in Python:
```
def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    odd_count = sum(1 for num in lst1 if num % 2 != 0)
    return "YES" if odd_count <= len(lst2) else "NO"
```
This code defines a function `exchange` that takes two lists of numbers, `lst1` and `lst2`, as input. It counts the number of odd numbers in `lst1` using a generator expression and then checks if this count is less than or equal to the length of `lst2`. If it is, it returns "YES", indicating that it is possible to exchange elements between the two lists to make all elements in `lst1` even. Otherwise,
