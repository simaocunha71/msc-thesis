```
def pluck(arr):
    even_nodes = [(node, i) for i, node in enumerate(arr) if node % 2 == 0]
    if not even_nodes:
        return []
    smallest_even_node = min(even_nodes, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
    return [smallest_even_node[0], smallest_even_node[1]]
```A solution for the problem is provided in the following Python code:

```python
def pluck(arr):
    even_nodes = [(node, i) for i, node in enumerate(arr) if node % 2 == 0]
    if not even_nodes:
        return []
    smallest_even_node = min(even_nodes, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
    return [smallest_even_node[0], smallest_even_node[1]]
```

This code defines a function called `pluck` that takes an array of nodes as input. The function first creates a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a node from the array and its index. The list only includes nodes that are even (i.e., their value is divisible by 2). If the list is empty (i.e., there are no even nodes in the array), the function returns an empty list.

If there are even nodes in the array, the function finds the node with the smallest value. If there are multiple nodes with the same smallest value, it returns the node with the smallest index. The function returns the node and its index as a list in the format `[smallest_value, its_index]`.

The code uses the `min` function with a custom key function to find the smallest even node. The key function takes a tuple as input and returns a tuple containing the node's value and its index. The `min` function then compares these tuples and returns the one with the smallest value and smallest index.

The code is efficient because it uses list comprehensions and the `min` function to process the array in a single pass. It also uses a custom key function to find the smallest even node, which allows it to handle the case where there are multiple nodes with the same smallest value. Overall, the code is easy to understand and efficient to run.
