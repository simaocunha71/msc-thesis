```
def pluck(arr):
    even_nodes = [node for node in arr if node % 2 == 0]
    if not even_nodes:
        return []
    smallest_even_value = min(even_nodes)
    return [smallest_even_value, arr.index(smallest_even_value)]
```


This function first filters out the even nodes from the array and checks if there are any. If there are no even nodes, it returns an empty list. If there are even nodes, it finds the smallest one and its index in the original array. It returns this value as a list in the format `[smallest_value, its_index]`. 

This function works correctly for the given constraints, which state that there are at most 10000 nodes and their values are non-negative integers. It also correctly handles the edge cases, such as an empty array or an array with no even nodes. 

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the array, because it needs to iterate over the array to filter out the even nodes and find the smallest one. The space complexity is also O(n), because it needs to store the even nodes in a list. 

This function can be improved by using the `min` function with a generator expression to find the smallest even value and its index in a single pass over the array, which would reduce the time complexity to O(n) and the space complexity to O(1). However, this would make the code more complex and harder to understand. 

Here is the improved version of the function:

```
def pluck(arr):
    smallest_even_value = min((node for node in arr if node % 2 == 0), default=None)
    if smallest_even_value is None:
        return []
    return [smallest_even_value, arr.index(smallest_even_value)]
```

This function uses a generator expression to iterate over the array and find the smallest even value. The `min` function returns the smallest value and its index. If there are no even values, the `min` function returns `None`, and the function returns an empty list. Otherwise, it returns the smallest even value and its index. 

This improved function has the same time and space complexity as the original function, but it is more efficient because it only needs to iterate over the array once. However, it is also more complex and harder to understand, so it may not be suitable for all situations.
