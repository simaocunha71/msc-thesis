def unique_digits(x):
    return sorted([i for i in x if '0' not in str(i) or '2' not in str(i) or '4' not in str(i) or '6' not in str(i) or '8' not in str(i)])

This function works by iterating over the list of integers, converting each integer to a string, and checking if any of the characters in the string are even digits (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8). If a number does not have any even digits, it is added to the list. Finally, the list is sorted in ascending order and returned. 

The condition '0' not in str(i) or '2' not in str(i) or '4' not in str(i) or '6' not in str(i) or '8' not in str(i) can be read as: "If the string representation of i does not contain 0, or 2, or 4, or 6, or 8, then i is added to the list". This is a concise way of checking if any even digits are present in the number. 

For example, if i is 153, the string representation is '153', which does not contain any even digits, so i is added to the list. If i is 142, the string representation is '142', which contains the even digit 2, so i is not added to the list. 

The time complexity of this function is O(n*m), where n is the number of elements in the list and m is the maximum number of digits in an integer in the list. This is because we are iterating over the list and for each element, we are iterating over its digits. The space complexity is O(n), as we are storing the result in a list. 





Test cases:
```
print(unique_digits([15, 33, 1422, 1]))  # Output: [1, 15, 33]
print(unique_digits([152, 323, 1422, 10]))  # Output: []
print(unique_digits([1, 3, 5, 7, 9]))  # Output: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
print(unique_digits([2, 4, 6, 8]))  # Output: []
print(unique_digits([100, 101, 102, 103,
