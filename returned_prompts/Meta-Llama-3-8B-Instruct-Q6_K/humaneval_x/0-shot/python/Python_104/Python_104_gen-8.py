    # Explanation: 
    # We use list comprehension to filter out numbers with even digits. 
    # 'any' function checks if any digit in a number is even. 
    # We convert each number to string to easily iterate over its digits. 
    # The 'sorted' function is used to sort the resulting list in increasing order. 
    # If no numbers with odd digits are found, an empty list is returned. 
    # This solution is efficient because it only iterates over each number once. 
    # The time complexity is O(n*m), where n is the number of elements in the input list and m is the maximum number of digits in a number. 
    # The space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list.  # noqa: E501
