```
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    if q != q[::-1]:
        return False
    return sum(q) <= w
```A solution is:

```
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    if q != q[::-1]:
        return False
    return sum(q) <= w
```
Explanation:

The function `will_it_fly` takes two arguments, `q` and `w`, where `q` is a list of integers and `w` is the maximum possible weight.

The function first checks if `q` is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse (`q[::-1]`). If `q` is not a palindrome, the function returns `False`.

If `q` is a palindrome, the function then checks if the sum of its elements is less than or equal to `w`. If the sum is less than or equal to `w`, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. This ensures that the object `q` will fly if it is balanced and the sum of its elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight `w`.
