def will_it_fly(q, w):
    if str(q) != str(q)[::-1]:
        return False
    return sum(q) <= w
```


The function `will_it_fly` checks if the list `q` is balanced (i.e., a palindrome) and if the sum of its elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight `w`. If the list is balanced and the sum of its elements is within the weight limit, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

The condition `str(q) != str(q)[::-1]` checks if the list `q` is a palindrome by comparing the original list with its reverse. If they are not equal, the list is not a palindrome, and the function returns `False`. 

The condition `sum(q) <= w` checks if the sum of the elements in the list `q` is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight `w`. If the sum is within the weight limit, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

For example, `will_it_fly([1, 2], 5)` returns `False` because the list is not balanced. `will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9)` returns `True` because the list is balanced and the sum of its elements is within the weight limit. `will_it_fly([3], 5)` returns `True` because the list is balanced and the sum of its elements is within the weight limit.
