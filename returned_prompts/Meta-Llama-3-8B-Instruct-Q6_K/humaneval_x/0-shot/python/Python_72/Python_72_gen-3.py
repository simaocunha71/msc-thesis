```
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    if q == q[::-1]:
        return sum(q) <= w
    else:
        return False
```


Explanation:

The function `will_it_fly` takes two parameters: `q`, the object that we want to check if it will fly, and `w`, the maximum possible weight.

We first check if `q` is balanced by comparing it to its reverse (`q[::-1]`). If `q` is equal to its reverse, it means that `q` is a palindromic list, and therefore it is balanced.

If `q` is balanced, we check if the sum of its elements is less than or equal to `w`. If it is, we return `True`, meaning that `q` will fly. Otherwise, we return `False`.

If `q` is not balanced, we immediately return `False`, because an unbalanced object cannot fly.

The function `will_it_fly` returns a boolean value indicating whether the object `q` will fly or not, based on the conditions specified in the problem.
