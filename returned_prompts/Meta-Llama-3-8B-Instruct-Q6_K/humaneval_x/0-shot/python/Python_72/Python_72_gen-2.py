```
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    if q != q[::-1]:
        return False
    return sum(q) <= w
```


This function first checks if the list q is balanced by comparing it with its reverse. If it's not balanced, it immediately returns False. If it is balanced, it then checks if the sum of the elements in q is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight w. If it is, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False. 

Note: The sum of the elements in q is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight w means that q can fly. The function will return True if q can fly and False if it can't. 

Also, the problem doesn't specify whether the input is a list of numbers or not. But based on the given examples, we can assume that the input will always be a list of numbers. If the input is not a list of numbers, the function will still work correctly, but it might not be what the user expects. 

The function is case-sensitive, so it will treat '3' and '3' as different numbers. If you want the function to treat '3' and '3' as the same number, you can convert the input list to a set and then back to a list before processing it. This will remove any duplicate numbers in the list. 

The function doesn't check if the input is valid or not. For example, if the input is a string or a dictionary, the function will still work correctly, but it might not be what the user expects. If you want the function to check if the input is valid, you can add some error checking code at the beginning of the function. 

The function uses the built-in functions sum() and slice() to calculate the sum of the elements in the list and to reverse the list. The function also uses the comparison operator != to check if the list is balanced.
