```
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    return q == q[::-1] and sum(q) <= w
```
This function checks if the list `q` is equal to its reverse (`q[::-1]`) which checks if it's a palindrome. It also checks if the sum of the elements in `q` is less than or equal to `w`. If both conditions are met, it returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`. 

For example, `will_it_fly([1, 2], 5)` returns `False` because the list is not a palindrome. `will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1)` returns `False` because the sum of the elements is more than the maximum possible weight. `will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9)` returns `True` because the list is a palindrome and the sum of the elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight. `will_it_fly([3], 5)` returns `True` because the list is a palindrome and the sum of the elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight.
