```
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    q = str(q)
    if q == q[::-1]:
        return sum(q) <= w
    else:
        return False
```



The function `will_it_fly` takes two parameters, `q` and `w`. `q` is the object that we want to know if it will fly, and `w` is the maximum possible weight. 

First, we convert the object `q` to a string. 

Then, we check if `q` is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse (`q[::-1]`). If `q` is a palindrome, it means that the object `q` is balanced.

If `q` is balanced, we check if the sum of its elements is less than or equal to `w`. If it is, we return `True`, meaning that the object `q` will fly. If the sum is greater than `w`, we return `False`, meaning that the object `q` will not fly.

If `q` is not a palindrome, we return `False`, meaning that the object `q` is not balanced and will not fly.
