The function total_match takes two lists of strings as input and returns the list that has the total number of characters in the strings less than the other list. If the two lists have the same number of characters, it returns the first list.

Here's how the function works:

1. It calculates the total number of characters in each list using a generator expression. The sum function is used to calculate the total number of characters.
2. It compares the total number of characters in each list. If the total number of characters in the first list is less than the second list, it returns the first list. If the total number of characters in the second list is less than the first list, it returns the second list.
3. If the total number of characters in both lists is the same, it returns the first list.

Here's an example of how the function works:
```
print(total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'Hi']))  # Output: ['hI', 'Hi']
print(total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hi', 'hi', 'admin', 'project']))  # Output: ['hi', 'admin']
print(total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'hi', 'hi']))  # Output: ['hI', 'hi', 'hi']
print(total_match(['4'], ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']))  # Output: ['4']
```
The function total_match works correctly in all these cases, returning the list that has the total number of characters less than the other list, or the first list if the total number of characters is the same.
