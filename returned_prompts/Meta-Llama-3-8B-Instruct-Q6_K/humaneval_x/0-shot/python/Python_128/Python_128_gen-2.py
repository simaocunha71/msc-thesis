The function `prod_signs` takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of the magnitudes of the integers multiplied by the product of the signs of each number in the list.

The function first checks if the input list is empty. If it is, the function returns `None`.

If the list is not empty, the function initializes two variables: `sign_product` and `magnitude_sum`. `sign_product` is used to keep track of the product of the signs of the numbers in the list, and `magnitude_sum` is used to keep track of the sum of the magnitudes of the numbers in the list.

The function then iterates over the list. For each number in the list, it checks if the number is zero. If it is, the function returns `0` because the product of any number with zero is zero.

If the number is not zero, the function multiplies `sign_product` by the sign of the number. The sign of a number is defined as 1 if the number is positive, -1 if the number is negative, and 0 if the number is zero. The function also adds the magnitude of the number to `magnitude_sum`.

Finally, the function returns the product of `sign_product` and `magnitude_sum`.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list, because the function iterates over the list once. The space complexity of this function is O(1), because the function uses a constant amount of space to store the variables `sign_product` and `magnitude_sum`.
