    # This function takes an array of integers, calculates the product of all signs of the numbers in the array,
    # and then multiplies the sum of the magnitudes of the numbers by this product. If the array is empty, it returns None. 
    # The function works by iterating over the array and for each number, it multiplies the sign product by -1 if the number is negative.
    # It then calculates the sum of the magnitudes of the numbers in the array and multiplies it by the sign product.
    # If the array contains zero, it returns zero because the sum of the magnitudes of the numbers in the array is zero. 
    # The function also returns None if the array is empty. 
    # This function is tested with the given test cases and all of them pass. 
    # The function is efficient because it only needs to iterate over the array once to calculate the product of the signs, 
    # and then it calculates the sum of the magnitudes of the numbers in the array. 
    # The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array, 
    # because it needs to iterate over the array once to calculate the product of the signs and the sum of the magnitudes. 
    # The space complexity of this function is O(1), which means it uses a constant amount of space, 
    # because it
