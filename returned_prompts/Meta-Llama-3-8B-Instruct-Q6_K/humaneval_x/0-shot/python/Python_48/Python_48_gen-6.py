```python
def is_palindrome(text: str) -> bool:
    return text == text[::-1]
```



Explanation:

The `is_palindrome` function checks if the given string `text` is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward. The function returns `True` if the string is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.

The implementation is straightforward: it simply compares the original string `text` with its reverse `text[::-1]`. If they are the same, the function returns `True`, indicating that the string is a palindrome. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The unit tests provided in the problem statement ensure that the function behaves correctly for various inputs:

* An empty string (`''`) is considered a palindrome, as it reads the same when reversed.
* A single-character string (`'aba'`) is also a palindrome.
* A longer string with repeated characters (`'aaaaa'`) is still a palindrome.
* A string with different characters (`'zbcd'`) is not a palindrome.

By passing these tests, we can be confident that the `is_palindrome` function correctly identifies palindromes.
