def is_palindrome(text: str):
    """
    Checks if given string is a palindrome
    """
    return text == text[::-1]  # Check if the text is equal to its reverse. If it is, it's a palindrome.
    # The [::-1] is a slice that returns the reversed string. This works because strings are iterable and the slice is applied to each character. The start and stop are omitted, so it starts from the end of the string and goes backwards to the start. The step is -1, so it moves backwards one character at a time.  # noqa: E305

    # Example usage:
    print(is_palindrome(''))  # Output: True
    print(is_palindrome('aba'))  # Output: True
    print(is_palindrome('aaaaa'))  # Output: True
    print(is_palindrome('zbcd'))  # Output: False
    # This function correctly identifies palindromes and non-palindromes. It does not handle non-string inputs. If you want to handle non-string inputs, you would need to add error checking.  # noqa: E305
    # This function works for any string, including empty strings, single-character strings, and strings with any number of characters. It correctly identifies palindromes and non-palindromes.  # noqa: E305
    # This function does not modify the input in any way. It simply checks if the input is a palindrome and returns a boolean value indicating whether it is or not.  # noqa: E305
    # This function is O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the input string. This is because it needs to iterate over the entire string to reverse it.  # noqa: E305
    # This function is O(n) space complexity, where n is the length of the input string. This is because it needs to store the reversed string in memory.  # noqa: E305
    # This function is stable, meaning it preserves the relative order of equal elements. It does not change the order of characters in the input string, it just checks if it is a palindrome.  # noqa: E305
    # This function is not thread-safe, as it does not use any shared state or locks. It is safe to use in a multithreaded environment.  # noqa: E305
    # This function is not designed to be used with very large input strings
