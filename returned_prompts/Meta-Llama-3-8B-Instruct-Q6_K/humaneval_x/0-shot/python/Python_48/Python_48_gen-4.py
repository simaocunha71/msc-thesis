```
def is_palindrome(text: str):
    return text == text[::-1]
```


The function `is_palindrome` checks if the given string `text` is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same backwards as forwards. The function returns `True` if the string is a palindrome, and `False` otherwise.

The function uses Python's slicing feature to reverse the string, `text[::-1]`, and then compares it to the original string using the `==` operator. If the two strings are the same, then the original string is a palindrome.

This function works for any string, including empty strings, single-character strings, and strings with any number of characters. It also works for strings with spaces, punctuation, and other non-alphanumeric characters.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness. For example, the test `is_palindrome('aba')` returns `True` because `'aba'` is a palindrome. The test `is_palindrome('zbcd')` returns `False` because `'zbcd'` is not a palindrome. The test `is_palindrome('aaaaa')` returns `True` because `'aaaaa'` is a palindrome. The test `is_palindrome('')` returns `True` because an empty string is considered a palindrome.
