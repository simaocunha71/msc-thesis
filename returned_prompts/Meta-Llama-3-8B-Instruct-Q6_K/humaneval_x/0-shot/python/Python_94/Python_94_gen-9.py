The `skjkasdkd` function takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of the digits of the largest prime number in the list.

The function first defines a helper function `is_prime` that checks whether a number is prime. It then uses a list comprehension to find the largest prime number in the input list.

Finally, it converts the largest prime number to a string, iterates over the characters (which are the digits) and sums them up.

This function should work for any list of integers. It has a time complexity of O(n * sqrt(m)), where n is the length of the input list and m is the largest number in the list. This is because it iterates over the list once to find the largest prime number, and then iterates over the digits of the prime number to sum them up. The `is_prime` function has a time complexity of O(sqrt(m)), which dominates the overall time complexity.
