The problem is asking to create a function that takes a string as input and returns the string where all lowercase characters are converted to uppercase and all uppercase characters are converted to lowercase.

Here is a Python solution for this problem:

```Python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    return string.swapcase()
```

This function uses the built-in `swapcase()` method of Python strings, which does exactly what we need: it flips the case of each character in the string. This method is available in Python 3.0 and later.

Here's how you would use this function:

```Python
print(flip_case('Hello'))  # Output: 'hELLO'
```


This will correctly flip the case of the input string, so that all lowercase characters become uppercase and all uppercase characters become lowercase.
