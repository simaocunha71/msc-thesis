def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    return ''.join(c.swapcase() for c in string)
```
This function uses a generator expression to iterate over each character in the input string, swaps the case of each character using the `swapcase()` method, and then joins the resulting characters back into a string using the `join()` method. The `swapcase()` method is a built-in method in Python that swaps the case of a single character, converting lowercase characters to uppercase and uppercase characters to lowercase.  For example, `'H'.swapcase()` returns `'h'`, and `'h'.swapcase()` returns `'H'`.  The `join()` method concatenates all the characters in the generator expression into a single string.  The resulting string has the case of each character flipped, as required.  For example, the input string `'Hello'` is converted to the output string `'hELLO'`.  The `swapcase()` method works correctly even if the input string contains non-ASCII characters, such as accented letters or non-Latin scripts.  The `join()` method also works correctly with non-ASCII characters, as long as the characters in the generator expression are all strings.  Therefore, this function is suitable for use with strings that contain a wide range of characters, not just ASCII letters.  The `swapcase()` method is a part of the Python standard library, so it is available on all platforms that support Python.  The `join()` method is also a part of the Python standard library, and it is available on all platforms that support Python.  Therefore, this function is portable and can be used on any platform that supports Python.  The function is also relatively efficient, as it uses a generator expression to iterate over the characters in the input string.  This means that it does not create a list of all the characters in the input string, which can be more memory-efficient than creating a list and then joining it.  Therefore, this function is suitable for use with large input strings.  Overall, this function is a simple and efficient way to flip the case of a string in Python.  It is suitable for use with a wide range of strings, including strings that contain non-ASCII characters, and it is portable and efficient.  It can be used in a variety of contexts, such as in a script, in a program, or in a web application.  It is a useful tool to have in your toolkit as a Python programmer.
