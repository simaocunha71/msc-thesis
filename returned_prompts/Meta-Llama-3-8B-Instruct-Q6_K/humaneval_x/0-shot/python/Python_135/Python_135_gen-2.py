The function `can_arrange(arr)` iterates through the array `arr` and checks if each element is less than the next one. If it finds an element that is greater than or equal to the next one, it returns the index of that element. If it doesn't find any such element, it returns -1.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the function:

1. The function initializes a loop that iterates through the array `arr` from the first element to the second last element.
2. Inside the loop, it checks if the current element `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to the next element `arr[i + 1]`.
3. If `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`, the function returns the index `i`. This means that `arr[i]` is not less than the next element, so the function stops iterating.
4. If the loop completes without finding an element that is greater than or equal to the next one, the function returns -1. This means that all elements in the array are less than the next one.

Here's an example of how the function works:

`can_arrange([1, 2, 4, 3, 5])`

1. The function iterates through the array and checks if each element is less than the next one.
2. It finds that `arr[0]` (1) is less than `arr[1]` (2).
3. It finds that `arr[1]` (2) is less than `arr[2]` (4).
4. It finds that `arr[2]` (4) is greater than or equal to `arr[3]` (3), so it returns the index `2`.

Therefore, the function returns `2`, which is the largest index of an element that is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it.
