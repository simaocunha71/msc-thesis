The function `can_arrange` iterates over the input array `arr` starting from the second element (index 1). For each element, it checks if the previous element is greater than or equal to the current element. If such an element is found, the function returns the index of the previous element. If no such element is found after iterating over the entire array, the function returns -1.

Here's a breakdown of the function:

1. `for i in range(1, len(arr))`: This loop iterates over the indices of the array starting from 1 (the second element).
2. `if arr[i-1] >= arr[i]`: This condition checks if the previous element is greater than or equal to the current element.
3. `return i - 1`: If the condition is true, the function returns the index of the previous element.
4. `return -1`: If the loop completes without finding a suitable element, the function returns -1.
