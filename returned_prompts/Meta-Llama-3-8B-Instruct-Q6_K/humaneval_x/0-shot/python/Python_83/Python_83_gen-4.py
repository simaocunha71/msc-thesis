This function calculates the count of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1.
For a 1-digit number, there is only one number that starts or ends with 1, which is 1 itself. For a 2-digit number, there are 10 numbers that start with 1, and 1 number that ends with 1, so the total count is 10 + 1 = 11. For a 3-digit number, there are 9 numbers that start with 1, and 9 numbers that end with 1, so the total count is 9 * 10 + 9 = 99.
In general, for an n-digit number, there are 9 numbers that start with 1, and 9 numbers that end with 1. So the total count is 9 * (10 ** (n - 1)) + 9. If n is 1, the total count is simply 10, because there is only one 1-digit number that starts or ends with 1. This is why we have a special case for n == 1.
The time complexity of this function is O(1), because it only involves a constant number of operations. The space complexity is also O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the result.
