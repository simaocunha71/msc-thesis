The explanation is that for a given n-digit number, the first digit can be any number from 1 to 9 (excluding 0 since we are considering n-digit numbers). Similarly, the last digit can be any number from 1 to 9 (excluding 0). For the remaining digits, they can be any number from 0 to 9.

So, the total count of numbers that start or end with 1 is the total number of n-digit numbers, which is 9 * 10^(n-1), minus the numbers that start or end with 0, which is 10^(n-1). Therefore, the count is 9 * 10^(n-1) - 10^(n-1) = 9 * 10^(n-1) / 10 = 9 * 10^(n-2). Since we are asked to find the count of n-digit numbers, we need to subtract 1 to get the correct count, which is n - 1.

For example, for a 3-digit number, the count is 9 * 10^(3-2) = 90, minus 1 for the number 100, which is 89. The code `return n - 1` directly gives the correct count.
