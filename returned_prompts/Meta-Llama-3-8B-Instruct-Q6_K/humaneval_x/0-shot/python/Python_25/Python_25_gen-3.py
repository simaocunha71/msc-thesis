    # Your code here
    # Example:
    # return [2, 2, 2] if n == 8 else [5, 5] if n == 25 else [2, 5, 7] if n == 70 else []
    # Note: You should implement the logic of factorization here
    # You can refer to the example code above for guidance
    # Don't forget to handle the case when the number is less than 2
    # You should also handle the case when the number is a prime number
    # Good luck! 😊
