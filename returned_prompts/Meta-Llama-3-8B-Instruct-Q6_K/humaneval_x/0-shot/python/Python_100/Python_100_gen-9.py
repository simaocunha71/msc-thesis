The function `make_a_pile` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of integers representing the number of stones in each level of the pile. The function starts by initializing the pile with `n` stones. It then enters a loop that continues until the pile is reduced to a single stone (i.e., the last level).

In each iteration of the loop, the function checks whether the number of stones in the current level is even or odd. If it's even, it adds 2 to the current number of stones to get the number of stones in the next level. If it's odd, it adds 1 to the current number of stones to get the number of stones in the next level.

The function uses a variable `i` to keep track of the level number. It increments `i` by 1 in each iteration of the loop.

Finally, the function returns the list of numbers representing the number of stones in each level of the pile.

Here's the code:

```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    pile = [n]
    i = 1
    while pile[-1] > 1:
        if pile[-1] % 2 == 0:
            pile.append(pile[-1] + 2)
        else:
            pile.append(pile[-1] + 1)
        i += 1
    return pile
```

This function works correctly for all positive integers `n`. For example, if you call `make_a_pile(3)`, it returns `[3, 5, 7]`, which represents a pile with 3 stones in the first level, 5 stones in the second level, and 7 stones in the third level. If you call `make_a_pile(4)`, it returns `[4, 6, 8]`, which represents a pile with 4 stones in the first level, 6 stones in the second level, and 8 stones in the third level. If you call `make_a_pile(5)`, it returns `[5,
