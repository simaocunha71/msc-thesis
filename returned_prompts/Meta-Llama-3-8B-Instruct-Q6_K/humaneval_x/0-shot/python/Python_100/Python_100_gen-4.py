The provided solution is a Python function `make_a_pile(n)` that generates a list of stones in each level of a pile, given a positive integer `n`. The function uses an if-else statement to determine whether the next level should have an odd or even number of stones, based on the parity of the previous level.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. Initialize an empty list `pile` to store the number of stones in each level.
2. Determine whether `n` is odd or even using the modulo operator (`%`).
3. If `n` is odd, set `next_odd` to `n + 2`, which will be the number of stones in the next level. If `n` is even, set `next_even` to `n + 2`.
4. Loop `n - 1` times to generate the rest of the pile.
5. In each iteration, check the parity of the previous level (`pile[-1] % 2 == 1` for odd, `pile[-1] % 2 == 0` for even).
6. If the previous level is odd, append `next_odd` to the pile and increment `next_odd` by 2. If the previous level is even, append `next_even` to the pile and increment `next_even` by 2.
7. Return the `pile` list.
