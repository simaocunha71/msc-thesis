The function `make_a_pile(n)` is designed to create a pile of `n` levels of stones, where the number of stones in each level follows a specific pattern. The pattern is as follows:

* The first level has `n` stones.
* The number of stones in the next level is the next odd number if `n` is odd, and the next even number if `n` is even.

Here is the implementation of the function in Python:

```
def make_a_pile(n):
    pile = [n]
    i = n
    while len(pile) < n:
        if i % 2 == 0:
            pile.append(i + 1)
        else:
            pile.append(i - 1)
        i += 1
    return pile
```

This function initializes a list `pile` with the number of stones in the first level, which is `n`. It then enters a loop that continues until the pile has `n` levels. In each iteration of the loop, it checks whether `i` is even or odd. If `i` is even, it adds `i + 1` to the pile, and if `i` is odd, it adds `i - 1` to the pile. Finally, it increments `i` by 1 and repeats the process until the pile has `n` levels. The function returns the list of numbers representing the number of stones in each level of the pile.

For example, if we call `make_a_pile(3)`, the function will return `[3, 5, 7]`, which represents the number of stones in each level of the pile. The first level has 3 stones, the second level has 5 stones, and the third level has 7 stones.
