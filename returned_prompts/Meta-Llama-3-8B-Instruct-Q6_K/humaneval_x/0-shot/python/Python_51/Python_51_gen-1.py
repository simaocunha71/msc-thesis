Here is a Python function that removes all vowels from a given string:
```
def remove_vowels(text):
    return ''.join([char for char in text if char.lower() not in 'aeiou'])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to create a new list containing only the characters that are not vowels. It then uses the `join` method to concatenate these characters into a single string.

Here's a breakdown of how the function works:

1. `char for char in text`: This is the iteration part of the list comprehension. It iterates over each character `char` in the input string `text`.
2. `if char.lower() not in 'aeiou'`: This is the filtering part of the list comprehension. It checks whether the character `char` is a vowel or not. It converts the character to lowercase using the `lower()` method, and then checks if it is in the string `'aeiou'`. If it is not, then the character is included in the new list.
3. `''.join(...)`: This is the concatenation part of the list comprehension. It takes the new list of characters and concatenates them into a single string using the `join()` method with an empty string `''` as the separator.

You can test this function using the examples you provided:
```
print(remove_vowels(""))  # ''
print(remove_vowels("abcdef\nghijklm"))  # 'bcdf\nghjklm'
print(remove_vowels("abcdef"))  # 'bcdf'
print(remove_vowels("aaaaa"))  # ''
print(remove_vowels("aaBAA"))  # 'B'
print(remove_vowels("zbcd"))  # 'zbcd'
``` 1
This function should work correctly for all the examples you provided. Let me know if you have any further questions! 1
