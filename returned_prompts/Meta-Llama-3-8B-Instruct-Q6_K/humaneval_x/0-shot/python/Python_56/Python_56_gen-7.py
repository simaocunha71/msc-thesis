This function uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack matches the closing bracket. If it doesn't match, it returns False. If it finishes iterating through the string and the stack is empty, it returns True. If the stack is not empty, it returns False. 

This function correctly handles strings with mismatched brackets, such as "><<>" or "<<" and strings with no closing brackets, such as "<". It also correctly handles strings with correctly paired brackets, such as "<>" or "<<><>>". 

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because it makes a single pass through the string. The space complexity is O(n), because in the worst case (when the input string is just a series of opening brackets), the stack will contain n elements. 

The unit tests provided demonstrate the function's correctness on a variety of input strings. The expected outputs are based on the function's definition: it should return True for strings with correctly paired brackets and False for strings with mismatched brackets.
