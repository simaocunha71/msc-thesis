# Explanation:
# This function uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets. 
# When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack does not match the closing bracket.
# If either condition is true, it returns False. 
# If it finishes iterating over the brackets and the stack is empty, it returns True. 
# If the stack is not empty, it returns False because there are unmatched opening brackets. 

# Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
# Space complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string. 
# This is because in the worst case, the stack will store all the opening brackets. 

# This function can be used to validate the correctness of HTML, XML, or any other type of bracketed code. 
# It is case-sensitive. 
# It does not handle nested brackets. 
# It does not handle brackets other than "<" and ">". 
# It does not handle whitespace or other characters in the input string. 
# It does not handle bracketed code with attributes or other complex structures. 
# It is not a full-fledged parser. 
# It is a simple tool for validating the basic syntax of bracketed code. 
# It can be used as a starting point for building a more comprehensive parser.  # 
# It is a basic implementation and may need to be modified or extended to fit the specific needs of your project. 
# It is not a production-ready solution. 
# It is a learning tool. 
# It is a basic example of how to use a stack to solve a problem. 
# It is a simple and efficient solution. 
# It is a good starting point for beginners. 
# It is a good reference for experienced programmers. 
# It is a good example of how to
