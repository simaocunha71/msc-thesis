This function uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. It iterates over the string, and for each character, it checks if it's an opening or a closing bracket. If it's an opening bracket, it pushes it onto the stack. If it's a closing bracket, it checks if the top of the stack matches the expected closing bracket. If it doesn't, it returns False. Finally, it returns True if the stack is empty, meaning all brackets were properly matched, and False otherwise.
