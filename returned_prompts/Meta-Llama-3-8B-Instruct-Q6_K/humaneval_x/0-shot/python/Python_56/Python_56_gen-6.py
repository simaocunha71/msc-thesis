    # This function counts the number of opening brackets and compares it with the number of closing brackets. If they are equal, it means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and it returns True. If the number of opening brackets is more than the number of closing brackets, it means there are some opening brackets without corresponding closing brackets, and it returns False. If the number of closing brackets is more than the number of opening brackets, it means there are some closing brackets without corresponding opening brackets, and it returns False.  # noqa: E501

    # Example usage:
    print(correct_bracketing("<"))  # Output: False
    print(correct_bracketing("<>"))  # Output: True
    print(correct_bracketing("<<><>>"))  # Output: True
    print(correct_bracketing("><<>"))  # Output: False  # noqa: E501
    # Example explanation:
    # In the first example, the string "<" has an opening bracket but no corresponding closing bracket, so the function returns False.
    # In the second example, the string "<>" has an opening bracket and a corresponding closing bracket, so the function returns True.
    # In the third example, the string "<<><>>" has two opening brackets and two corresponding closing brackets, so the function returns True.
    # In the fourth example, the string "><<" has a closing bracket without a corresponding opening bracket, so the function returns False.  # noqa: E501
    # Example space complexity:
    # The function uses a constant amount of space to store the opening_brackets variable, which is 1, so the space complexity is O(1).  # noqa: E501
    # Example time complexity:
    # The function iterates over the string once, so the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string.  # noqa: E501
