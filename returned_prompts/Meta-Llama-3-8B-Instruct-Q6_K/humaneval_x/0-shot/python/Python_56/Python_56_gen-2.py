Explanation:
We use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. When we encounter an opening bracket, we push it onto the stack. When we encounter a closing bracket, we check if the stack is empty or the top of the stack is not an opening bracket. If either condition is true, we return False. If we finish iterating over the string and the stack is empty, it means every opening bracket had a corresponding closing bracket, so we return True. Otherwise, we return False.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because we iterate over the string once. The space complexity is O(n) because in the worst case, we might need to store every opening bracket in the stack.
