This function uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack is not an opening bracket. If either condition is true, it returns False, indicating that there is no corresponding opening bracket. At the end of the function, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, it returns True, indicating that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. If the stack is not empty, it returns False, indicating that there are unmatched opening brackets.
