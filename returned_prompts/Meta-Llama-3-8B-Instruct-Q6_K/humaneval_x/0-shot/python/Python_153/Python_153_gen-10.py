The function `Strongest_Extension` takes two parameters: `class_name` and `extensions`. It iterates over each extension in the list, calculates its strength, and keeps track of the strongest one it has found so far. If it finds an extension with a higher strength, it updates the strongest extension and its strength. Finally, it returns a string in the format `ClassName.StrongestExtensionName`.

Here is the breakdown of the code:

1. `strongest = None`: Initializes the `strongest` variable to `None`, which will hold the strongest extension found so far.
2. `strongest_strength = 0`: Initializes the `strongest_strength` variable to `0`, which will hold the strength of the strongest extension found so far.
3. `for extension in extensions`: Loops over each extension in the list.
4. `strength = sum(1 for char in extension if char.isupper()) - sum(1 for char in extension if char.islower())`: Calculates the strength of the current extension. The `sum` function is used to count the number of uppercase letters (`char.isupper()`) and lowercase letters (`char.islower()`) in the extension, and the difference is taken to get the strength.
5. `if strength > strongest_strength`: Checks if the current extension's strength is higher than the strongest strength found so far. If it is, updates the strongest strength and the strongest extension.
6. `return f"{class_name}.{strongest}"`: Returns a string in the format `ClassName.StrongestExtensionName`, using the strongest extension found.

For example, if you call `Strongest_Extension('my_class', ['AA', 'Be', 'CC'])`, the function will return `'my_class.AA'` because 'AA' is the strongest extension (its strength is `2 - 0 = 2`). If there were two or more extensions with the same strength, the function would return the one that comes first in the list.
