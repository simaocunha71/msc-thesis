```
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    def calculate_strength(ext):
        return sum(1 for c in ext if c.isupper()) - sum(1 for c in ext if c.islower())

    strongest = max(extensions, key=calculate_strength)
    return f"{class_name}.{strongest}"
```


The function `Strongest_Extension` takes a class name and a list of extensions as input. It first defines a helper function `calculate_strength` to calculate the strength of an extension based on the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in the extension's name. 

Then it uses the built-in `max` function to find the strongest extension, using `calculate_strength` as the key function to determine the strength of each extension. 

Finally, it returns a string in the format `ClassName.StrongestExtensionName` by formatting the class name and the strongest extension with the `f` string notation. 

The function handles the case where there are multiple extensions with the same strength by choosing the one that comes first in the list. 

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of extensions, because it needs to iterate over each extension once to calculate its strength. The space complexity is O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the class name, the strongest extension, and the helper function. 





Example:
```
print(Strongest_Extension('my_class', ['AA', 'Be', 'CC']))  # Output: my_class.AA
```
This function works as expected, returning the strongest extension 'AA' for the class 'my_class'. 

Note: This function assumes that the input extensions are strings. If the extensions can be of other types, the function may need to be modified accordingly. 





Test cases:
```
print(Strongest_Extension('Slices', ['SErviNGSliCes', 'Cheese', 'StuFfed']))  # Output: Slices.SErviNGSliCes
print(Strongest_Extension('my_class', ['AA', 'Be', 'CC']))  # Output: my_class.AA
print(Strongest_Extension('Test', ['Aa', 'Bb', 'Cc']))  # Output: Test.Aa
``` 





This function passes all the test cases. It correctly identifies the strongest extension based on the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in the extension's name, and returns the class
