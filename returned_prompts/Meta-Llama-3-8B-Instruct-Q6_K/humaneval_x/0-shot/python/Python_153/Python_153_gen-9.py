This function iterates over each extension in the list. For each extension, it calculates the strength by subtracting the number of lowercase letters from the number of uppercase letters. It keeps track of the strongest extension and its strength, and updates them if it finds a stronger extension. Finally, it returns the class name followed by the strongest extension. If there are multiple extensions with the same strength, it chooses the one that appears first in the list.  The function uses a generator expression to count the uppercase and lowercase letters in the extension. The `isupper()` and `islower()` methods of the string class are used to check if a character is uppercase or lowercase. The `sum()` function is used to calculate the total count. The `f-string` is used to format the output string.  The function returns the strongest extension name with the class name.  For example, if the input is `('my_class', ['AA', 'Be', 'CC'])`, the output will be `'my_class.AA'`.  



This function works correctly with the given test cases and can be used to find the strongest extension for a given class and list of extensions.  



For example, if you call `Strongest_Extension('my_class', ['AA', 'Be', 'CC'])`, the function will return `'my_class.AA'` because 'AA' is the strongest extension.  If you call `Strongest_Extension('Slices', ['SErviNGSliCes', 'Cheese', 'StuFfed'])`, the function will return `'Slices.SErviNGSliCes'` because 'SErviNGSliCes' is the strongest extension.  



This function is efficient because it only iterates over the list of extensions once, and it uses generator expressions to count the uppercase and lowercase letters in each extension.  Therefore, it has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of extensions.
