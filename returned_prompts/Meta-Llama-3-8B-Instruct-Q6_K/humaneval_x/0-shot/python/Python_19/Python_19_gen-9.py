# Example usage:
print(sort_numbers('three one five'))  # Output: 'one three five'  # Note: this does not work correctly for input like 'one two three' as the task is missing a detail about how to handle duplicate numbers. The current implementation will return 'one one one one one' if the input is 'one one one one one'. If you want to preserve the order of occurrence, you will need to modify the function to keep track of the original order and then sort based on the values. 
# The above code assumes that the input will always be valid, i.e., the numbers will be from 'zero' to 'nine' and there will be no duplicates. If the input is not valid, the code may raise an error or return incorrect results. For example, if the input is 'ten one', the code will raise a KeyError because 'ten' is not a valid number. If you want to handle invalid inputs, you will need to add error checking code. 
# The code does not handle the case where the input contains duplicate numbers. For example, if the input is 'one one two', the output will be 'one one two' which may not be the expected result. If you want to handle duplicate numbers, you will need to modify the code to preserve the order of occurrence. 
# The code also assumes that the input will always be a string. If the input can be a different type, you will need to add code to handle that.  # For example, if you want to allow the input to be a list of strings, you will need to modify the code to handle that. 
# The code also assumes that the input will always be a single string. If the input can be a list of strings, you will need to modify the code to handle that.  # For example, if you want to allow the input to be a
