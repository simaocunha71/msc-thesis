Explanation:
This function iterates over each character in the input string. If the character is a digit, it checks if the digit is in the list of prime numbers. If it is, it increments the prime_count variable. If the character is not a digit, it checks if the hexadecimal value of the character (using the dictionary) is in the list of prime numbers. If it is, it also increments the prime_count variable. The function finally returns the prime_count variable. 

The function correctly handles the cases where the input string contains both digits and non-digit characters, and correctly identifies the prime hexadecimal digits. It also correctly handles the case where the input string is empty. 

However, the function does not check if the input string is a valid hexadecimal number. If the input string contains characters that are not valid hexadecimal digits, the function may not work correctly. 

The function could be improved by adding error checking to ensure that the input string is a valid hexadecimal number. This could involve checking that the string only contains valid hexadecimal digits, and that it does not start with '0' unless it is the string '0'. 

The function could also be improved by using a more efficient method to check if a number is prime. The current function checks every prime number up to the number to see if it is prime, which is not very efficient. A more efficient method would be to check if the number is divisible by any number up to its square root. 

Finally, the function could be improved by using a more efficient method to convert the hexadecimal characters to decimal numbers. The current function uses a dictionary to convert the characters, which is not very efficient. A more efficient method would be to use the built-in int function with base 16 to convert the characters. 

Here is the improved function:
```
def hex_key(num):
    if not num:
        return 0
