Explanation:
The function `hex_key` takes a hexadecimal number as a string and counts the number of hexadecimal digits that are primes. It uses a dictionary `hex_dict` to map hexadecimal digits to their decimal values. Then, it iterates over the input string, checks if the decimal value of each digit is in the list of prime numbers, and increments the `prime_count` if it is. Finally, it returns the `prime_count`.

Note: The list of prime numbers in the code is not exhaustive, but it includes the prime numbers that are hexadecimal digits (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13). If you want to include all prime numbers, you would need a more complex algorithm to generate them.
