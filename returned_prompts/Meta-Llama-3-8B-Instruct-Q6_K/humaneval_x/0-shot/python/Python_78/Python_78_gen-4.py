Explanation:

The function `hex_key` takes a hexadecimal number as a string and counts the number of hexadecimal digits that are primes.

Here is the explanation of the code:

- We define a set `primes` containing the hexadecimal digits that are prime numbers: `{"2", "3", "5", "7", "B", "D"}`. The string `B` represents the decimal number 11, and `D` represents the decimal number 13.

- We initialize a variable `count` to 0. This variable will be used to count the number of prime hexadecimal digits.

- We iterate over each character `char` in the input string `num`.

- If the character `char` is in the set `primes`, we increment the `count` by 1.

- Finally, we return the `count`.

This function works correctly for all the examples provided. For example, for `num = "AB"`, the output is 1 because there is only one prime hexadecimal digit, which is `B`. For `num = "1077E"`, the output is 2 because there are two prime hexadecimal digits, which are `7` and `7`. And so on.
