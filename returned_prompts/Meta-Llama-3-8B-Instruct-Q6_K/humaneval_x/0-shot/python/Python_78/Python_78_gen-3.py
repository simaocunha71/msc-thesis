This solution works by first creating a dictionary that maps hexadecimal digits to their decimal equivalents. It then iterates over the input string, checking each digit to see if it is a prime number. If the digit is a hexadecimal digit, it uses the dictionary to get the decimal equivalent and checks if that is a prime number. If the digit is a decimal digit, it simply checks if that is a prime number. If the digit is a prime number, it increments a count. Finally, it returns the count.

The `is_prime` function is a helper function that checks if a number is prime. It does this by checking if the number is divisible by any number up to the square root of the number. If it is divisible, it is not a prime number. If it is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is a prime number. This function is used by the `hex_key` function to check if a number is prime.
