```
def hex_key(num):
    primes = {'2': True, '3': True, '5': True, '7': True, 'B': True, 'D': True}
    count = 0
    for digit in num:
        if digit.upper() in primes:
            count += 1
    return count
```


Here's an explanation of the code:

1. We define a dictionary `primes` that maps hexadecimal digits to their corresponding prime numbers. We only include the digits that are prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7, B, D).
2. We initialize a variable `count` to 0, which will keep track of the number of prime hexadecimal digits in the input string.
3. We iterate over each character `digit` in the input string `num`.
4. For each character, we check if it is present in the `primes` dictionary using the `in` operator. If it is, we increment the `count` variable by 1.
5. Finally, we return the `count` variable, which represents the number of prime hexadecimal digits in the input string.

The code is efficient because it only needs to iterate over the input string once and uses a dictionary to quickly look up whether a digit is prime or not. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. The space complexity is O(1), as the dictionary is fixed and does not grow with the input size.
