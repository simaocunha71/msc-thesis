    return sorted([i for i in range(min(a, b), max(a, b) + 1) if i % 2 == 0]) if a <= b else sorted([i for i in range(max(a, b), min(a, b) - 1, -1) if i % 2 == 0])  # Check if a <= b. If not, swap them. Then use list comprehension to generate the even numbers, and finally use the sorted function to sort them. If a <= b, generate the even numbers from a to b (inclusive) in ascending order. If not, generate them from b to a (inclusive) in descending order. This solution assumes that a and b are positive integers, as stated in the problem. It also assumes that a <= b, but checks for this condition and swaps them if necessary. The function returns a list of the even digits between a and b, in ascending order. If there are no such digits (i.e., if a and b are not both even), the function returns an empty list.  # Check if a <= b. If not, swap them. Then use list comprehension to generate the even numbers, and finally use the sorted function to sort them. If a <= b, generate the even numbers from a to b (inclusive) in ascending order.
