The function `count_nums` counts the number of elements in the input array `arr` that have a sum of digits greater than 0. The sum of digits of a number is calculated by converting the number to a string, iterating over each character (digit), converting each character back to an integer, and summing them up. The `abs` function is used to ensure that the sum of digits is calculated correctly for negative numbers. The `sum` function is used to count the number of elements that meet the condition.

Here's a breakdown of the code:
- `for num in arr`: This loop iterates over each element in the input array.
- `if sum(int(digit) for digit in str(abs(num))) > 0`: This condition checks if the sum of digits of the current number is greater than 0.
- `sum(1 for ... )`: This is a generator expression that counts the number of elements that meet the condition. The `1` is returned for each element that meets the condition, and the `sum` function adds up these values.

For example, if the input array is `[-1, 11, -11]`, the function will return `1` because only `11` has a sum of digits greater than 0 (1+1=2). If the input array is `[1, 1, 2]`, the function will return `3` because all three numbers have a sum of digits greater than 0 (1+1=2, 1+2=3). If the input array is empty, the function will return `0` because there are no elements to count.
