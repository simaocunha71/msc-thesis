Explanation:
The problem requires creating a function that takes a non-negative integer `n` and returns an array of the first `n` integers that are prime numbers and less than `n`. The function `is_prime` checks whether a number is prime by iterating through numbers from 2 to the square root of the number and checking if the number is divisible by any of them. The main function `count_up_to` iterates through numbers from 2 to `n-1`, checks if each number is prime using the `is_prime` function, and appends it to the `primes` list if it is. The function stops iterating once it has found `n` prime numbers. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function returns an empty list. If `n` is greater than 1, the function returns the list of prime numbers. The time complexity of this function is O(n*sqrt(n)) and the space complexity is O(n).
