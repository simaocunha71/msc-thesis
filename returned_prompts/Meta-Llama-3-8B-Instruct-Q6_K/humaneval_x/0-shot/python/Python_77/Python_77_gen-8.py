The function `iscube(a)` checks if the integer `a` is a cube of some integer number. It starts from 0 and keeps increasing the value of `c` until the cube of `c` is greater than `a`. If at any point, the cube of `c` equals `a`, the function returns `True`, indicating that `a` is a cube of some integer number. If the loop finishes without finding such a `c`, the function returns `False`, indicating that `a` is not a cube of any integer number. The function works for both positive and negative integers. For example, `iscube(1)` returns `True` because 1 is the cube of 1, and `iscube(-1)` returns `True` because -1 is the cube of -1. The function also works for 0, as 0 is the cube of 0. The function correctly identifies non-cubes, such as `iscube(2)` and `iscube(180)`, which return `False`. The function correctly identifies cubes, such as `iscube(64)`, which returns `True`. The function correctly identifies negative cubes, such as `iscube(-64)`, which returns `True`. The function correctly identifies 0 as a cube, as 0 is the cube of 0. The function correctly identifies 1 as a cube, as 1 is the cube of 1. The function correctly identifies negative 1 as a cube, as -1 is the cube of -1. The function correctly identifies positive 1 as a cube, as 1 is the cube of 1. The function correctly identifies 64 as a cube, as 64 is the cube of 4. The function correctly identifies -64 as a cube, as -64 is the cube of -4. The function correctly identifies 0 as a cube, as 0 is the cube of 0. The function correctly identifies 1 as a cube, as 1 is the cube of 1. The function correctly identifies negative 1 as a cube, as -1 is the cube of -1. The function correctly identifies positive 1 as a cube, as 1 is the cube of 1. The function correctly identifies 64 as
