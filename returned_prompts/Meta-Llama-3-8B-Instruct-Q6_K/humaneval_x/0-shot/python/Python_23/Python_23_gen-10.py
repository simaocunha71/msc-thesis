```
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    return len(string)
```



This solution defines a function called `strlen` that takes a string as input and returns its length. The function uses the built-in `len` function in Python, which returns the number of items in an object. In this case, the object is a string, so `len` returns the number of characters in the string. The function is then tested with the unit tests provided, which verify that the function correctly returns the length of an empty string and a string with three characters.
