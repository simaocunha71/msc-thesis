```
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    return len(string)
```


Python function to calculate the length of a given string. The `len()` function is used to get the length of the string. The function takes a string as an argument and returns its length. The unit tests provided ensure that the function works correctly for both an empty string and a non-empty string. The tests show that the function returns 0 for an empty string and 3 for the string 'abc'. The function is defined as `strlen` and accepts a string as an argument, returning its length as an integer. The unit tests are written in the style of the `unittest` framework.
