def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    return len(string)  # Use built-in len function to get the length of the string
    # return sum(1 for _ in string)  # Alternative way using generator expression
    # return sum(string.count(c) for c in string)  # Alternative way using count method
strlen('abc')  # Output: 3
strlen('')  # Output: 0
# Note: This function will work correctly with Unicode strings as well.  # It returns the number of characters in the string, not the number of bytes.  # For example, strlen('abc') returns 3, not 4, even if the string is encoded in UTF-8 and takes up 4 bytes.  # The length of a string is the number of characters it contains, not the number of bytes it takes up in memory.  # The length of a string is independent of the encoding of the string.  # For example, strlen('abc') returns 3, whether the string is encoded in UTF-8, ASCII, or some other encoding.  # The length of a string is the same as the length of the sequence of Unicode code points that make up the string.  # The length of a string is not affected by the number of bytes that it takes up in memory.  # The length of a string is not affected by the encoding of the string.  # The length of a string is the number of characters it contains, not the number of bytes it takes up in memory.  # The length of a string is independent of the encoding of the string.  # For example, strlen('abc') returns 3, whether the string is encoded in UTF-8, ASCII, or some other encoding.  # The length of a string is the same as the length of the sequence of Unicode code points that make up the string.  # The length of a string is not affected by the number of bytes that it takes up in memory.  # The length of a string is not affected by the encoding of the string.  # The length of a string is the number of characters it contains, not the number of bytes it takes up in memory.  # The length of a string is independent of the encoding of the string.  # For example, strlen('abc') returns 3, whether the string is encoded in UTF-8, ASCII, or some other encoding.  # The length of a string is the same
