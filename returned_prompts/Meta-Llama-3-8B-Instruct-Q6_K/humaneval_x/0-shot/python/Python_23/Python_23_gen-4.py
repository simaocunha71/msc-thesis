```
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    return len(string)
```

This function takes a string as input and returns its length. It uses Python's built-in `len` function to get the length of the string. The `len` function returns the number of items in an object. In the case of a string, it returns the number of characters in the string. The function can handle an empty string and returns 0 for it. The unit tests provided in the problem description test the function with an empty string and a string with three characters. The function passes these tests and returns the correct results.
