def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    return len(string)
```





## 1.  `strlen` Function Definition
The `strlen` function takes a string as input and returns its length. The function name `strlen` is a common name for a function that calculates the length of a string, similar to the `strlen` function in the C programming language.

## 2.  Test Cases
The test cases are used to verify the correctness of the `strlen` function. The test cases include:

*   `strlen('')`: This test case checks the length of an empty string. The expected result is 0.
*   `strlen('abc')`: This test case checks the length of a string with three characters. The expected result is 3.

## 3.  Solution
The solution to the problem is to define the `strlen` function that takes a string as input and returns its length using the built-in `len` function in Python.

Here is the implementation:
```
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    return len(string)
```
This function takes a string as input, and the `len` function returns the length of the string. The `strlen` function simply returns the result of the `len` function, which is the length of the input string.

With this implementation, the `strlen` function passes the test cases:
```
>>> strlen('')
0
>>> strlen('abc')
3
```





## 4.  Output
The output of the `strlen` function is the length of the input string. For example, if you call the function with the string `'abc'`, the output will be `3`, which is the length of the string.

Here is the output of the test cases:
```
>>> strlen('')
0
>>> strlen('abc')
3
```





## 5.  Conclusion
In this solution, we defined a `strlen` function that takes a string as input and returns its length using the built-in `len` function in Python. The function passes the test cases, and the output is the length of the input string. This solution is a simple and efficient way to calculate the length of a string in Python.
