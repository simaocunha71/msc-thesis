The given problem is asking to write a function that takes a list of GPAs as input and returns a list of corresponding letter grades according to the provided grading table. 

Here's a Python solution for the problem:

```
def numerical_letter_grade(grades):
    letter_grades = ['A+', 'A', 'A-', 'B+', 'B', 'B-', 'C+', 'C', 'C-', 'D+', 'D', 'D-', 'E']
    cutoffs = [4.0, 3.7, 3.3, 3.0, 2.7, 2.3, 2.0, 1.7, 1.3, 1.0, 0.7, 0.0]
    return [letter_grades[i] for i in range(len(cutoffs)-1) if grades[0] > cutoffs[i] and grades[0] <= cutoffs[i+1]]
```

In this function, we first define the list of letter grades and the corresponding cutoffs. Then, we use a list comprehension to iterate over the cutoffs and find the corresponding letter grade for the given GPA. The `if` condition in the list comprehension ensures that the GPA is within the range of the current cutoff and the next one. If the GPA is greater than the last cutoff, the function will return the last letter grade. 

The function takes a list of GPAs as input and returns a list of corresponding letter grades. For example, `numerical_letter_grade([4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5])` would return `['A+', 'B', 'C
