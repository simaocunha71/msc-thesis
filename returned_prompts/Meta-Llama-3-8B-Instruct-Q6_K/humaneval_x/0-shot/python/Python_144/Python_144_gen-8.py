The function `simplify` takes two fractions as strings, `x` and `n`, and returns a boolean value indicating whether the product of the two fractions is an integer or not. It does this by first converting the fractions into integers and then finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the denominators. It then reduces the fractions by dividing both the numerators and denominators by the GCD. Finally, it checks whether the product of the reduced fractions is an integer. If it is, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function works by iterating through all possible divisors of the denominator, starting from the maximum value, and checking whether the divisor is also a factor of the other denominator. If it is, it divides both numerators and denominators by the divisor and repeats the process until the divisor is 1. The function then returns the result of the product of the reduced fractions. If the product is an integer, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the maximum of the denominators of the two input fractions. The space complexity is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the variables. The function works correctly for all valid input fractions, as it correctly reduces the fractions by dividing both numerators and denominators by the GCD, and checks whether the product of the reduced fractions is an integer. It also correctly handles the case where one or both of the denominators is 1, as it correctly reduces the fractions in
