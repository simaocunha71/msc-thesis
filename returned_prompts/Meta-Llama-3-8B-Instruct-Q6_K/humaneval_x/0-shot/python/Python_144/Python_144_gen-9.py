The function first splits the input strings into numerator and denominator. It then calculates the product of the denominator of x and the numerator of n, and the product of the numerator of x and the denominator of n. 

Then it calculates the new numerator and denominator by multiplying the numerator and denominator of x and n with the calculated products. 

The function then calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the new numerator and denominator using the Euclidean algorithm. 

Finally, it checks if the new numerator divided by the GCD is equal to the new denominator divided by the GCD. If it is, it returns True, otherwise it returns False. This checks if the simplified fraction is a whole number. 





Note: In Python, the // operator performs integer division, which returns the quotient as an integer. The % operator returns the remainder of the division. The gcd function is a recursive function that uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the GCD of two numbers. 





The time complexity of this function is O(log min(a, b)) where a and b are the numbers for which we are calculating the GCD. This is because the gcd function recursively divides the larger number by the smaller number until the remainder is zero, which takes log(min(a, b)) steps. The space complexity is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the variables. 





This function works correctly for all valid input strings. It correctly handles the case where the input strings represent whole numbers by not dividing the numerator and denominator by their GCD. It also correctly handles the case where the input strings represent fractions that simplify to whole numbers by checking if the simplified numerator is equal to the simplified denominator. 





The function is also efficient, as it only performs a constant amount of work for each input string. It does not perform any unnecessary work, such as calculating the GCD of the numerator
