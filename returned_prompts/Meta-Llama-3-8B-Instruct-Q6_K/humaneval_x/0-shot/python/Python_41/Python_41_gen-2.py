```
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    return n
```

Explanation:
The problem description states that the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so when two cars collide, they will not stop or change direction. This means that the number of collisions is equal to the number of pairs of cars that are heading in opposite directions. Since there are `n` cars heading left to right and `n` cars heading right to left, there are `n` pairs of cars that are heading in opposite directions, resulting in `n` collisions. Therefore, the function returns `n`.
