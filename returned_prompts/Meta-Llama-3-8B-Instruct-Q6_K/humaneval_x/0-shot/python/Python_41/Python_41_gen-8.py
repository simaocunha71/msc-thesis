Explanation:
This function simulates a car race where n cars are moving left to right and n cars are moving right to left. The cars are moving at the same speed, and the function counts the number of collisions between the cars. The function uses two lists, left_cars and right_cars, to store the positions of the cars. It then iterates over the positions of the left and right cars and checks if any of the cars are colliding. If a collision is found, the function adds the colliding pair to a set called colliding_pairs. Finally, the function returns the number of colliding pairs, which is the number of collisions in the car race. The time complexity of this function is O(n^2), where n is the number of cars.
