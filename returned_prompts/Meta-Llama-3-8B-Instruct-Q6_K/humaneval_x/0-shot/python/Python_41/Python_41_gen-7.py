```
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if i != j:
                distance = i - j
                if distance % 2 == 1:
                    count += 1
    return count
```
The idea is that two cars will collide if they are driving in opposite directions and their distance is an odd number. The reason is that the distance between them will always be an even number when they are moving in the same direction, and an odd number when they are moving in opposite directions. So we can iterate over all pairs of cars and check if their distance is an odd number. If it is, we increment the count of collisions.

The time complexity of this function is O(n^2) because we are iterating over all pairs of cars. The space complexity is O(1) because we are using a constant amount of space to store the count of collisions.
