This problem is a classic example of a "line sweep" problem, which can be solved by using a sweep line algorithm. The idea is to sort the cars by their positions and then iterate through the sorted list to count the number of collisions.

Here is the Python solution:
```
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    # Initialize the result
    collisions = 0

    # Generate the positions of the cars
    left_cars = [(x, 1) for x in range(n)]
    right_cars = [(x, -1) for x in range(n)]

    # Sort the cars by their positions
    cars = sorted(left_cars + right_cars)

    # Initialize the current position and the set of cars that have passed this position
    current_position = 0
    passed_cars = set()

    # Iterate through the sorted list of cars
    for x, direction in cars:
        # If the car has passed the current position, add it to the set of passed cars
        if x > current_position:
            passed_cars.add(x)

        # If the car is moving left to right, increment the current position
        if direction == 1:
            current_position = x

        # If the car is moving right to left, decrement the current position
        else:
            current_position = x

        # Check if there are any cars that have passed this position and are moving in the opposite direction
        for y in passed_cars:
            if y > x and (y - x) % 2 == 1:
                collisions += 1

    return collisions
```
This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting step, and a space complexity of O(n) due to the need to store the positions of the cars. The solution works by iterating through the sorted list of cars and checking for collisions with the cars that have passed the current position. The `passed_cars` set is used to keep track of the cars that have passed the current position. The `collisions` variable is incremented each time a collision is found. The function returns the total number of collisions.
