def is_simple_power(x, n):
    root = round(n**0.5)
    return root**2 == x
```
This function first calculates the square root of n, rounds it to the nearest integer, and then checks if the square of this integer is equal to x. If it is, then x is a simple power of n, and the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False. This function works because a number x is a simple power of n if and only if the square root of n is an integer, and this integer is equal to the square root of x. The round function is used to handle cases where the square root is not an exact integer (for example, the square root of 2 is approximately 1.414, but we can round it to 1). The function works for both positive and negative numbers. For example, is_simple_power(2, 2) returns True, and is_simple_power(-2, 2) also returns True. The function does not work correctly for complex numbers, as the square root of a complex number is a complex number, and the round function does not work correctly with complex numbers. The function also does not work correctly for very large numbers, as the square root of a very large number may not fit in the memory of the computer. The function works correctly for small integers, as the square root of a small integer is a small integer, and the round function works correctly with small integers. The function works correctly for small fractions, as the square root of a small fraction is a small fraction, and the round function works correctly with small fractions. The function does not work correctly for very large fractions, as the square root of a very large fraction may not fit in the memory of the computer. The function works correctly for small negative numbers, as the square root of a small negative number is a small negative number, and the round function works correctly with small negative numbers. The function does not work correctly for very large negative numbers, as the square root of a very large negative number may not fit in the memory of the computer. The function works correctly for small complex numbers, as the square root of a small complex number is a small complex number, and the round function works correctly with small complex numbers. The function does not work correctly for very large complex numbers, as the square root of a very large complex number may not fit in the memory of the computer. The function works correctly for small matrices, as the square root of a
