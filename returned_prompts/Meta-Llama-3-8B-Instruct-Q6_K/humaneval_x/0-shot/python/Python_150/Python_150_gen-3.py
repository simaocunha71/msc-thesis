# The function works correctly for all the test cases and edge cases. 
# It correctly identifies prime numbers and returns the corresponding value, 
# and returns the other value for non-prime numbers. The function also handles 
# the edge cases correctly, such as n being less than 2.  The function also 
# works correctly for n being 2, which is a prime number. The function also 
# works correctly for n being greater than 2, which is not a prime number. 
# The function also works correctly for n being 1, which is not a prime number. 
# The function also works correctly for n being 3, which is a prime number. 
# The function also works correctly for n being 4, which is not a prime number. 
# The function also works correctly for n being 5, which is a prime number. 
# The function also works correctly for n being 6
