```
def cycpattern_check(a, b):
    b_len = len(b)
    if b_len > len(a):
        return False
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i:i+b_len] == b:
            return True
        if a[i:i+b_len] == b + a[:i]:
            return True
    return False
```





Here is the explanation of the code:

1. We first check if the length of the second word (b) is greater than the length of the first word (a). If it is, we can immediately return False because the second word cannot be a substring of the first word.

2. Then we iterate over the first word (a) and check for every substring of the same length as the second word (b) if it matches the second word. We use slicing to get the substring and compare it with the second word.

3. We also check if the second word is a rotation of the current substring by comparing it with the concatenation of the current substring and the beginning of the first word (a[:i]). If it matches, we return True.

4. If none of the above conditions are met, we return False, indicating that the second word is not a substring of the first word or any of its rotations.
