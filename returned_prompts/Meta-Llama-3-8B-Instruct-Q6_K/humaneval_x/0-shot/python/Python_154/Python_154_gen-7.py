The problem is asking to check if the second word (or any of its rotations) is a substring of the first word. 

Here's a Python solution that uses a loop to rotate the second word and checks if it's a substring of the first word:

```
def cycpattern_check(a, b):
    for i in range(len(b)):
        if b in a[i:] + a[:i]:
            return True
    return False
```

This function works by looping over the length of the second word. For each iteration, it takes a slice of the first word from the current index to the end, and concatenates it with a slice of the first word from the start to the current index. It then checks if the second word is a substring of this concatenated string. If it finds a match, it returns True. If it doesn't find a match after checking all rotations, it returns False. 

For example, if the input is "abcd" and "abd", the function will check if "abd" is a substring of "cdab", "daba", "abdc", and "abcd", and return False if it doesn't find a match. If the input is "hello" and "ell", it will check if "ell" is a substring of "hello", "ello", "lleh", and "hell", and return True if it finds a match. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(n*m), where n is the length of the first word and m is the length of the second word. 

Please note that this solution assumes that the input words are case-sensitive and do not contain any spaces or punctuation. If you need to handle these cases, you may need to add additional code to preprocess the input words. 

Also, this solution will return False if the second word is longer than the first word. If you want to return True in this case, you can modify the function to return True if the second word is longer than the first word. 

You can test this function with the provided examples to verify that it works correctly. 

```
print(cycpattern_check("abcd","abd"))  # False
print(cycpattern_check("hello","ell"))  # True
print(cycpattern_check("whassup","psus"))  # False
