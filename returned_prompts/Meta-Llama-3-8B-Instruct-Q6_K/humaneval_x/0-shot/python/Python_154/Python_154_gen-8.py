This function checks if the second word is a substring of the first word or any of its rotations. If the second word is longer than the first word, it immediately returns False. 

Then, it checks for each rotation of the first word if it contains the second word as a substring. If it finds a match, it returns True. 

If it checks all rotations and doesn't find a match, it returns False. 

The time complexity of this function is O(n*m), where n is the length of the first word and m is the length of the second word. The space complexity is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the indices and the substrings.
