This function works by iterating over each character in the second word and checking if the word or any of its rotations is a substring in the first word. The rotation is done by slicing the second word and concatenating it with the rest of the second word. If the word is found in the first word, the function returns True. If the word is not found in the first word after checking all rotations, the function returns False. 

This function works for all the test cases provided. It has a time complexity of O(n*m), where n is the length of the first word and m is the length of the second word. This is because in the worst case, the function has to check every character in the first word for every character in the second word. 

The space complexity is O(1), which means the space used does not change with the size of the input, because the function only uses a constant amount of space to store the variables and does not use any data structures that scale with the input size.  # 

This function is efficient and can handle large inputs because it only iterates over the first word once for each character in the second word, and it does not use any data structures that scale with the input size.  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #  #
