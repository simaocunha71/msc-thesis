Explanation:

This function checks if the second word or any of its rotations is a substring in the first word. 

The function first checks if the length of the first word is less than the length of the second word. If it is, it immediately returns False, because a shorter word cannot contain a longer word as a substring.

Then it iterates over the second word, and for each character, it checks if the second word (rotated by that many characters) is a substring of the first word. 

If it finds a rotation of the second word that is a substring of the first word, it returns True. 

If it checks all rotations of the second word and none of them are substrings of the first word, it returns False. 

This function works because a string is a substring of another string if and only if it is equal to a substring of that string. Rotating a string is equivalent to taking a substring of that string. 

So, checking all rotations of the second word is equivalent to checking all substrings of the second word, which is equivalent to checking if the second word is a substring of the first word. 

This function has a time complexity of O(n*m), where n is the length of the first word and m is the length of the second word. This is because it checks all rotations of the second word, and each rotation takes O(m) time.
