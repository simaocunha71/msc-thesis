```
def add_elements(arr, k):
    return sum(x for x in arr[:k] if 10 <= len(str(x)) <= 2)
```


This code defines a function `add_elements` that takes a list `arr` and an integer `k` as input. It returns the sum of the elements in the first `k` elements of `arr` that have at most two digits.

The code uses a generator expression to iterate over the first `k` elements of `arr`. For each element, it converts the element to a string using `str(x)`, checks if the length of the string is between 2 and 10 (inclusive), and sums up the elements that meet this condition.

For example, given `arr = [111,21,3,4000,5,6,7,8,9]` and `k = 4`, the output would be `24` because the sum of the elements with at most two digits from the first `k` elements of `arr` is `21 + 3`.
