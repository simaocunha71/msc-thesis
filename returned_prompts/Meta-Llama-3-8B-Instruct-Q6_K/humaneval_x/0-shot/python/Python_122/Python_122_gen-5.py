def add_elements(arr, k):
    result = 0

        if len(str(abs(num))) <= 2:
            result += num

Explanation:
This function takes in an array of integers and an integer k as input. It initializes a variable `result` to store the sum of the elements with at most two digits from the first k elements of the array.

It then iterates over the first k elements of the array using a for loop. For each element, it converts the absolute value of the element to a string and checks if the length of the string is less than or equal to 2. If it is, it adds the element to the `result`.

Finally, it returns the `result`.

In the given example, the function would return 24, which is the sum of 21 and 3, both of which have at most two digits.
