def add_elements(arr, k):
    return sum(num for num in arr[:k] if len(str(abs(num))) <= 2)
```
The provided function `add_elements` takes a list of integers `arr` and an integer `k` as input. It returns the sum of the elements with at most two digits from the first `k` elements of `arr`. The function uses a generator expression to iterate over the first `k` elements of `arr`. For each element, it converts the absolute value of the element to a string, gets the length of the string, and checks if the length is less than or equal to 2. If the condition is true, the element is included in the sum. The `sum` function is used to calculate the total sum of the selected elements. The function returns the result.
