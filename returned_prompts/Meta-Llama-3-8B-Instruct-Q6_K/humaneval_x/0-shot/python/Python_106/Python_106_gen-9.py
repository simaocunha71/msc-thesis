The function f(n) takes an integer n as a parameter and returns a list of size n. The value of the element at index i in the list is the factorial of i if i is even, or the sum of numbers from 1 to i otherwise.

Here is the Python code for the function f(n):

```
import math

def f(n):
    result = []
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            result.append(math.factorial(i))
        else:
            result.append(sum(range(1, i+1)))
    return result
```

In this code, the range function is used to generate numbers from 1 to n. For each number i in this range, the code checks if i is even (i % 2 == 0). If it is, the code calculates the factorial of i using the math.factorial function and appends it to the result list. If i is not even, the code calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to i using the sum function and range function, and appends it to the result list. Finally, the function returns the result list.

For example, if we call f(5), the function will return [1, 2, 6, 24, 15], which are the factorials of even numbers and the sums of numbers from 1 to i for odd numbers.
