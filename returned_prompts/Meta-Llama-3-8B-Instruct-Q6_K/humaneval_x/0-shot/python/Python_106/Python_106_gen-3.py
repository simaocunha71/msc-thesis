```
def f(n):
    result = []
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            result.append(math.factorial(i))
        else:
            result.append(sum(range(1, i+1)))
    return result
```


In this code, we iterate over the range from 1 to n (inclusive). For each i, we check if it's even (i % 2 == 0) or odd. If it's even, we append the factorial of i to the result list. If it's odd, we append the sum of numbers from 1 to i to the result list. Finally, we return the result list. The math.factorial function is used to calculate the factorial of a number. The sum function is used to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to i. The range function is used to generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to i. The result list is initialized before the loop, and its elements are appended one by one during the loop. The result list is then returned after the loop.
