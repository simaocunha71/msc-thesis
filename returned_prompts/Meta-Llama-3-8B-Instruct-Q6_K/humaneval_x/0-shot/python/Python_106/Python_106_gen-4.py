```
def f(n):
    result = []
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            result.append(factorial(i))
        else:
            result.append(sum(range(1, i+1)))
    return result
```

Explanation:
The function `f(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of size `n`. The list is generated by iterating over the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive). For each `i` in this range, the function checks if `i` is even by using the modulus operator (`i % 2 == 0`). If `i` is even, the function calculates the factorial of `i` using the `factorial` function and appends it to the result list. If `i` is odd, the function calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to `i` using the `sum` function and `range` function, and appends it to the result list. Finally, the function returns the result list.

The `factorial` function is not defined in this code snippet, but it is assumed to be a function that calculates the factorial of a given integer. You can define this function as follows:

```
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
```

This `factorial` function uses recursion to calculate the factorial of a given integer `n`. It returns 1 if `n` is 0, and otherwise it returns the product of `n` and the factorial of `n-1`. This function assumes that the input `n` is a non-negative integer. If you want to handle negative integers or non-integer inputs, you would need to add additional error handling code.
