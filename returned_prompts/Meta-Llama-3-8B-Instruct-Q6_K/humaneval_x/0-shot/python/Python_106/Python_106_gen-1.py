```
def f(n):
    result = []
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            result.append(math.factorial(i))
        else:
            result.append(sum(range(1, i+1)))
    return result
```


The function `f(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of size `n` where each element is calculated based on the condition.
If the index `i` is even, the function calculates the factorial of `i` using the `math.factorial(i)` function from the math module.
If the index `i` is odd, the function calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to `i` using the `sum(range(1, i+1))` function.
The function then returns the list of calculated values. 

Example: 
`f(5)` will return `[1, 2, 6, 24, 15]`. 
Here, `f(1)` is 1, `f(2)` is 2, `f(3)` is 6 (1+2), `f(4)` is 24 (1*2*3*4), and `f(5)` is 15 (1+2+3+4+5). 

The function works correctly for any positive integer `n`.  The time complexity of this function is O(n) because it needs to iterate over the range of `n` to calculate the values. The space complexity is also O(n) as it needs to store the result in a list of size `n`.  The function uses the math module's factorial function, which has a time complexity of O(n) as well.  Therefore, the overall time complexity of the function is O(n).  The space complexity is also O(n) as it needs to store the result in a list of size `n`.  Therefore, the overall space complexity is O(n).

Note: The math module's factorial function is only available in Python 3.0 and later. In Python 2.7, you can use the `functools.reduce` function with the `operator.mul` function to calculate the factorial. For example:
```python
import functools
import operator

def factorial(n):
    return functools.reduce(operator.mul, range(1, n+1))
```


Alternatively, you can define your own factorial function using a loop:
