    return [s for s in strings if s.startswith(prefix)]



Note: The function takes a list of strings and a prefix as input. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list, and for each string, it checks if the string starts with the given prefix using the `startswith` method. If it does, the string is included in the output list. If not, it's skipped. The function returns the filtered list of strings.
