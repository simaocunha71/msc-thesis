def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    return [string for string in strings if string.startswith(prefix)]
    # The list comprehension iterates over the input list 'strings', 
    # and includes a string in the output list if the string starts with the given 'prefix'. 
    # The 'startswith' method returns True if the string begins with the given prefix, 
    # and False otherwise. 
    # This is a concise and efficient way to implement the filtering operation. 
    # It is also easy to understand and modify for more complex filtering requirements. 
    # For example, you could filter for strings that contain the prefix anywhere within the string, 
    # rather than just at the beginning, by using the 'in' operator instead of 'startswith'. 
    # This flexibility makes list comprehensions a powerful tool for data processing tasks. 
    # Note that this implementation is case-sensitive, 
    # so it will treat 'A' as a different prefix than 'a'. 
    # If you want to perform case-insensitive filtering, you can convert both the string and the prefix to lowercase or uppercase before comparing them. 
    # For example, you could use the 'lower' method to convert both the string and the prefix to lowercase, 
    # like this: [string for string in strings if string.lower().startswith(prefix.lower())]. 
    # This would allow you to match strings that start with the prefix regardless of whether they are uppercase or lowercase. 
    # This is just one example of how you could modify the implementation to suit your specific needs. 
    # The key idea is to use the 'startswith' method or a similar method to compare the string with the prefix, 
    # and to use a list comprehension to create the output list. 
    # From there, you can customize the implementation to fit your specific requirements. 
    # For example, you could filter for strings that contain the prefix anywhere within the string, 
    # rather than just at the beginning. 
    # You could also filter for strings that contain multiple prefixes, 
    # or that contain a prefix followed by a specific set of characters. 
    # The possibilities are endless, and the key is to use the 'startswith' method or a similar method 
    # to compare the string with the prefix, and to use a list comprehension to create the output list. 
    # This is a powerful and flexible way
