# Code explanation: 
# The function takes a string and an integer as arguments. 
# The string contains information about the number of apples and oranges in the basket, 
# and the integer is the total number of fruits in the basket. 
# The function removes the words "apples" and "oranges" from the string and converts 
# the remaining string into an integer, which is the number of fruits in the basket. 
# It then subtracts the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits 
# to get the number of mango fruits in the basket. 
# The function returns this number. 
# The function uses the replace() method to remove the words "apples" and "oranges" 
# from the string, and the int() function to convert the remaining string into an integer. 
# The function also uses the replace() method with multiple arguments to remove 
# the words "apples", "oranges", "apple", and "orange" from the string. 
# The function then subtracts the number of apples and oranges from the total 
# number of fruits to get the number of mango fruits in the basket. 
# The function returns this number.  # 
# The output of the function is the number of mango fruits in the basket. 
# The function can be used to solve the problem of finding the number of mango 
# fruits in a basket of fruits, given the total number of fruits in the basket 
# and the number of apples and oranges in the basket. 
# The function is useful for solving problems that involve counting the number 
# of fruits in a basket, and can be used in a variety of applications, such as 
# in a fruit
