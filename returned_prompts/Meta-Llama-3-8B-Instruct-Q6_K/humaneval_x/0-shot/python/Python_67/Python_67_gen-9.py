This function takes two parameters: a string `s` that represents a number of apples and oranges distributed in a basket, and an integer `n` that represents the total number of the fruits in the basket. The function returns the number of the mango fruits in the basket.

The function first removes the words ' apples', ' oranges', ' and', and ' ' from the string `s` using the `replace` method. Then, it splits the string into two parts at the first space character, converts the parts to integers, and subtracts the sum of the two integers from the integer `n`. The result is the number of the mango fruits in the basket.

The function is tested with several test cases, and the results are printed to the console. The output of each test case is the expected output. For example, the output of the first test case is 8, which is the number of mango fruits in the basket when there are 5 apples and 6 oranges, and the total number of fruits is 19. Similarly, the output of the second test case is 2, which is the number of mango fruits in the basket when there are 0 apples and 1 orange, and the total number of fruits is 3. The output of the third test case is 95, which is the number of mango fruits in the basket when there are 2 apples and 3 oranges, and the total number of fruits is 100. The output of the fourth test case is 19, which is the number of mango fruits in the basket when there are 100 apples and 1 orange, and the total number of fruits is 120. The output of the fifth test case
