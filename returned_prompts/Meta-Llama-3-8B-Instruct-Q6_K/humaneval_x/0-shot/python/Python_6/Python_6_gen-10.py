    # This function works by iterating over the paren_string and maintaining a stack to keep track of the nesting level. When an opening parenthesis is encountered, it is pushed onto the stack, and when a closing parenthesis is encountered, the top of the stack is popped. The maximum depth of nesting is updated whenever the stack size increases. Finally, the maximum depth is appended to the result list for each group of parentheses.  # This function works by iterating over the paren_string and maintaining a stack to keep track of the nesting level.
