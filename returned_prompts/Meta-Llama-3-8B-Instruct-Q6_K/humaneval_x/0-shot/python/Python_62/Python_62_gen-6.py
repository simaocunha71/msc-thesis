def derivative(xs: list):
    return [xs[1] + 2 * i * xs[i + 1] for i in range(len(xs) - 1)]


Explanation:
The derivative of a polynomial is given by the formula:

f'(x) = f'(x0) + f''(x0) * x + f'''(x0) * x^2 + ...

where f'(x) is the derivative of f(x) and f''(x) is the second derivative of f(x).

In the context of a polynomial, the derivative is given by the formula:

f'(x) = xs[1] + 2 * i * xs[i + 1] for i in range(len(xs) - 1)

where xs is a list of coefficients of the polynomial.

The function derivative(xs: list) takes a list of coefficients as input and returns a new list representing the derivative of the polynomial.

For example, the polynomial 3 + x + 2x^2 + 4x^3 + 5x^4 has coefficients [3, 1, 2, 4, 5]. The derivative of this polynomial is 1 + 4x + 12x^2 + 20x^3, which can be represented as the list [1, 4, 12, 20].

The function can be used as follows:

derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])  # returns [1, 4, 12, 20]
derivative([1, 2, 3])  # returns [2, 6]
```
