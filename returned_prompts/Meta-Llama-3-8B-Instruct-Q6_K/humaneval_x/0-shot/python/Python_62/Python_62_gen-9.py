def derivative(xs: list):
    return [xs[i] * (i + 1) for i in range(1, len(xs))]
```

Explanation:
The derivative of a polynomial is calculated by multiplying each term by its exponent and then decrementing the exponent by 1. This is a fundamental concept in calculus. In this code, we use list comprehension to achieve this.

Let's break it down:

1. `range(1, len(xs))`: This generates a sequence of indices from 1 to the length of the input list `xs`, which represents the exponents of the polynomial.

2. `xs[i] * (i + 1)`: For each index `i`, we multiply the corresponding coefficient `xs[i]` by `(i + 1)`, which is the new exponent.

3. `[ ... for i in range(1, len(xs))]`: This is the list comprehension that generates the list of coefficients for the derivative. It applies the operation `xs[i] * (i + 1)` to each index `i` in the range and collects the results in a new list.

For example, if the input is `[3, 1, 2, 4, 5]`, the output will be `[1, 4, 12, 20]`, which are the coefficients of the derivative polynomial `x + 4x + 12x^2 + 20x^3`. If the input is `[1, 2, 3]`, the output will be `[2, 6]`, which are the coefficients of the derivative polynomial `2 + 6x`. 

This code is concise, readable, and efficient, making it a good solution for this problem.
