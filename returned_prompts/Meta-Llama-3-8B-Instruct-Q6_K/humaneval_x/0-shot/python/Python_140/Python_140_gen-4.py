```
def fix_spaces(text):
    text = text.replace(' ', '_')
    text = text.replace('  ', '-').replace('   ', '-').replace('    ', '-').replace('     ', '-')
    return text
```
The provided solution iterates through the string and replaces the spaces with underscores. Then, it iterates again and replaces any occurrences of 2, 3, 4, or 5 consecutive spaces with a single hyphen. Note that this solution assumes that the maximum number of consecutive spaces is 5, which may not be the case for all inputs. A more robust solution could involve using a regular expression to find and replace consecutive spaces with a hyphen. Here is an example of how you could do that:

```
import re

def fix_spaces(text):
    text = text.replace(' ', '_')
    text = re.sub(r' {2,}', '-', text)
    return text
```

In this solution, the regular expression `r' {2,}'` matches any sequence of 2 or more spaces. The `sub` function then replaces all occurrences of this pattern with a single hyphen. This solution is more robust because it can handle any number of consecutive spaces, not just 2, 3, 4, or 5.
