The goal is to find the minimum number of changes required to make the array palindromic. To achieve this, we can iterate through the array and count the number of changes needed at each position.

Here's a Python solution:

```python
def SmallestChange(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    if n <= 1:
        return 0

    left, right = 0, n - 1
    changes = 0

    while left < right:
        if arr[left] != arr[right]:
            # Find the maximum value in the left half
            max_left = max(arr[left:right+1])

            # Replace all elements in the left half with this maximum value
            arr[left:right+1] = [max_left] * (right - left + 1)

            # Increment the change count
            changes += right - left

        left += 1
        right -= 1

    return changes
```

This solution works by maintaining two pointers, `left` and `right`, that start at the beginning and end of the array, respectively. It then iterates through the array, comparing the elements at the `left` and `right` positions. If they are not equal, it finds the maximum value in the left half, replaces all elements in the left half with this maximum value, and increments the change count. The process continues until the `left` and `right` pointers meet.

For example, given the array `[1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 9, 6]`, the function returns `4`, which is the minimum number of changes required to make the array palindromic. The array becomes `[1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 7, 9, 6]` after the changes.
