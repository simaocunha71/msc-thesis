Explanation:

The problem is solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to create a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum number of changes needed to make the subarray `arr[0..i]` palindromic, considering that the last `j` elements are included in the subarray.

The base case is `dp[0][0] = 0`, which means that the empty subarray is already palindromic and requires no changes.

For each subarray `arr[0..i]`, we consider two cases:

1. The current element `arr[i]` is included in the subarray. In this case, we need to make the subarray `arr[0..i-1]` palindromic, and then consider the current element. If the current element is the same as the corresponding element from the beginning of the subarray (i.e., `arr
