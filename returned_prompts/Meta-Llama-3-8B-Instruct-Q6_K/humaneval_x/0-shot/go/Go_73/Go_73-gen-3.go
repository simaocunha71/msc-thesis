Explanation:
The problem can be solved by sorting the array and then counting the number of elements that are not equal to the corresponding element from the end of the array. This is because a palindromic array is read the same backwards and forwards, so the elements from the start and end of the array should be equal.

In the code, we first create a copy of the array and sort it. Then, we initialize two pointers, one at the start and one at the end of the array. We loop through the array until the two pointers meet, and for each element, we check if it is equal to the corresponding element from the end of the array. If it is not equal, we increment the count of changes and move the right pointer to the left. If it is equal, we move both pointers. Finally, we return the count of changes.

In the main function, we test the Smallest
