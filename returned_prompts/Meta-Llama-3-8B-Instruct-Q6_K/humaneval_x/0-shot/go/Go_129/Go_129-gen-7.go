The problem is to find the minimum path of length `k` in the grid. The path should be lexicographically smallest. The path can start from any cell and can move to any of the neighbor cells (up, down, left, right). The path should not go off the grid.

The problem can be solved by using a BFS (Breadth-First Search) algorithm with a priority queue. The priority queue will store the cells to be visited and the path that has been taken so far.

Here is the solution in Go:

```go
import (
    "fmt"
    "queue"
)

func Minpath(grid [][]int, k int) []int {
    m, n := len(grid), len(grid[0])
    dir := [][]int{{-1, 0}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {0, 1}}
    visited := make([][]bool, m)
    for i := range visited {
        visited[i] = make([]bool, n)
    }
    pq := queue.New()
    res := make([]int, 0)
    for i := 0; i < m; i++ {
        for j := 0; j < n; j++ {
            if len(res) < k {
                pq.Enqueue(struct{}{}, struct{ val int; path []int }{val: grid[i][j], path: append(res, grid[i][j])})
                visited[i][j] = true
            }
        }
    }
    for k > 0 {
        val := pq.Dequeue().(struct{ val int; path []int }).val
        res = res[:len(res)-1]
        k--
        for i := 0; i < 4; i++ {
            x, y := i/2, i%2
            nx, ny := i-2, i%2
            if x >= 0 && x < m && y >= 0 && y < n && !visited[x][y] {
                pq.Enqueue(struct{}{}, struct{ val int; path []int }{val: grid[x][y], path: append(res, grid[x][y])})
                visited[x][y] = true
            }
        }
    }
    return res
}

func main() {
    grid := [][]int{{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}}
    k :=
