The problem is to find the minimum path of length k in a grid, where each cell contains a unique value from 1 to N*N, and N is the number of rows and columns in the grid. The path can start from any cell, and in each step, you can move to any of the neighbor cells. The goal is to find the path that visits exactly k cells and has the smallest value in the cell that it visits. The path is considered less than another path if the values in the cells it visits are lexicographically smaller.

The approach to solve this problem is to use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. We start from each cell in the grid and perform a BFS to find the shortest path of length k. We use a priority queue to store the cells to be visited, and we use a set to keep track of the cells that have been visited.

Here is the implementation of the BFS algorithm in Go:

```go
func Minpath(grid [][]int, k int) []int {
    m, n := len(grid), len(grid[0])
    res := make([]int, 0)
    for i := 0; i < m; i++ {
        for j := 0; j < n; j++ {
            if grid[i][j] > 0 {
                visited := make(map[[2]int]bool)
                queue := []struct {
                    x, y, val int
                }{{i, j, grid[i][j]}}
                visited[[2]int{i, j}] = true
                for len(queue) > 0 {
                    x, y, val := queue[0].x, queue[0].y, queue[0].val
                    queue = queue[1:]
                    if len(res) < k {
                        res = append(res, val)
                    } else {
                        for _, dir := range [][2]int{{-1, 0}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {0, 1}} {
                            nx, ny := x+dir[0], y+dir[1]
                            if nx >= 0 && nx < m && ny >= 0 && ny < n && !visited[[2]int{nx, ny}] {
                                if len(res) < k {
 queue = append(queue, struct {
 x, y, val int
 }{nx, ny, grid[nx][ny]})
 visited[[2]int{nx, ny}]
