The problem can be solved by implementing a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. The idea is to start from each cell, and for each cell, try to find the minimum path of length k. The path is considered minimum if the sequence of values is lexicographically smaller than any other sequence.

Here is the solution in Golang:
```go
func Minpath(grid [][]int, k int) []int {
    m, n := len(grid), len(grid[0])
    res := make([]int, 0)
    for i := 0; i < m; i++ {
        for j := 0; j < n; j++ {
            dfs(grid, i, j, k, []int{}, &res)
        }
    }
    return res
}

func dfs(grid [][]int, i, j int, k int, path []int, res *[]int) {
    if k == 0 {
        *res = append(*res, path...)
        return
    }
    for _, neighbor := range getNeighbors(i, j, grid) {
        path = append(path, grid[neighbor[0]][neighbor[1]])
        dfs(grid, neighbor[0], neighbor[1], k-1, path, res)
        path = path[:len(path)-1]
    }
}

func getNeighbors(i, j int, grid [][]int) [][]int {
    m, n := len(grid), len(grid[0])
    neighbors := make([][]int, 0)
    if i > 0 {
        neighbors = append(neighbors, []int{i - 1, j})
    }
    if i < m-1 {
        neighbors = append(neighbors, []int{i + 1, j})
    }
    if j > 0 {
        neighbors = append(neighbors, []int{i, j - 1})
    }
    if j < n-1 {
        neighbors = append(neighbors, []int{i, j + 1})
    }
    return neighbors
}
```
The `Minpath` function iterates over each cell in the grid and starts a DFS from each cell. The `dfs` function explores all possible paths of length k starting from the current cell. The `getNeighbors` function returns the neighbors of a cell.

The `res` variable stores the minimum path found so far. The `path` variable stores the current path being explored. The `k` variable keeps track of the remaining length of the path.
