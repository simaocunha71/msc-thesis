The problem can be solved using a queue-based BFS approach. The idea is to maintain a queue of cells to visit and a set of visited cells to avoid revisiting the same cell. We also maintain a variable to store the minimum path found so far.

Here is the implementation in Go:

```go
func Minpath(grid [][]int, k int) []int {
    rows, cols := len(grid), len(grid[0])
    visited := make(map[[2]int]bool)
    queue := make([][2]int, 0)
    dir := [4][2]int{{-1, 0}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {0, 1}}
    minPath := make([]int, 0)
    start := [2]int{0, 0}
    queue = append(queue, start)
    visited[[2]int{0, 0}] = true
    for i := 0; i < k; i++ {
        size := len(queue)
        for j := 0; j < size; j++ {
            cur := queue[0]
            queue = queue[1:]
            minPath = append(minPath, grid[cur[0]][cur[1]])
            for _, d := range dir {
                next := [2]int{cur[0] + d[0], cur[1] + d[1]}
                if next[0] >= 0 && next[0] < rows && next[1] >= 0 && next[1] < cols && !visited[next] {
                    queue = append(queue, next)
                    visited[next] = true
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return minPath
}
```

This function takes a 2D grid and an integer k as input and returns the minimum path of length k as a slice of integers. The function uses a queue to keep track of the cells to visit and a set to keep track of the visited cells. It also maintains a variable to store the minimum path found so far.

The function starts by initializing the queue with the starting cell and marking it as visited. Then it enters a loop that continues for k steps. In each step, it dequeues a cell, appends its value to the minimum path, and enqueues its neighbors that have not been visited before. After k steps, it returns the minimum path.

The time complexity of this function is O(N * N * k) where N is the number of rows (or columns
