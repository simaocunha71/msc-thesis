Explanation:

This problem can be solved by using a BFS (Breadth-First Search) algorithm to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. We start from the top-left cell (0, 0) and explore all the neighboring cells in each step. We keep track of the visited cells using a 2D boolean array `visited`.

We use a queue to store the cells to be visited. We initialize the queue with the starting cell (0, 0) and mark it as visited. Then, we iterate k times to find the minimum path of length k. In each iteration, we visit all the cells in the queue, mark them as visited, and add their neighboring cells to the queue.

We keep track of the values of the cells in the path using an array `res`. We update `res` with the value of the current cell in each iteration.

Finally, we return the array `res` which contains the values of the cells in the minimum path of length k.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the size of the grid. The space complexity is also O(n^2) for storing the `visited` array and the queue.
