The problem is a variation of the problem of finding the shortest path in a graph. We can use a priority queue to solve this problem. The priority queue will store the cells that we have visited and the distance from the starting cell to the current cell.

We will use a boolean array to keep track of the cells that we have visited. We will also use a variable to store the minimum path.

We will start from the first cell and add it to the priority queue. We will then enter a loop that will continue until we have visited k cells.

In each iteration of the loop, we will pop the cell with the minimum distance from the priority queue. We will then visit its neighbors and add them to the priority queue if they have not been visited before. We will also update the minimum path if the distance from the starting cell to the current cell is less than the minimum path.

Finally, we will return the minimum path.

Here is the implementation of the solution:
```go
func Minpath(grid [][]int, k int) []int {
    m, n := len(grid), len(grid[0])
    visited := make([][]bool, m)
    for i := 0; i < m; i++ {
        visited[i] = make([]bool, n)
    }
    pq := []struct{ x, y, dist int }{{0, 0, 0}}
    visited[0][0] = true
    res := []int{}
    for pq != nil && len(pq) > 0 {
        x, y, dist := pq[0].x, pq[0].y, pq[0].dist
        pq = pq[1:]
        if dist > k {
            break
        }
        res = append(res, grid[x][y])
        if len(res) == k {
            break
        }
        for dx, dy := -1, 0, 1, 0; dx+dy < m && dx+dy >= 0 && dy+dx < n && dy+dx >= 0; dx, dy = dx+1, dy+1 {
            nx, ny := x+dx, y+dy
            if !visited[nx][ny] {
                visited[nx][ny] = true
                pq = append(pq, struct{ x, y, dist int }{nx, ny, dist+1})
            }
        }
    }
    return res
}
```
