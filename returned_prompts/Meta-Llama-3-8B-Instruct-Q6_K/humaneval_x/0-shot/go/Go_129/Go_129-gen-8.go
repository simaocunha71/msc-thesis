This problem is a variation of the shortest path problem. We need to find the shortest path of length k in the grid, where the path can visit the same cell multiple times.

We can use a priority queue to solve this problem. The priority queue will store the current cell and the list of values on the cells that the path goes through.

We will start from each cell in the grid and explore all the possible paths of length k. For each path, we will calculate its length and the list of values on the cells that the path goes through. We will use the priority queue to store the paths and their lengths.

Finally, we will return the path with the minimum length.

Here is the implementation in Go:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math/rand"
	"sort"
	"container/heap"
)

type Cell struct {
	x, y int
}

type Path struct {
	cell  Cell
	list  []int
	length int
}

type PriorityQueue []*Path

func (pq PriorityQueue) Len() int           { return len(pq) }
func (pq PriorityQueue) Less(i, j int) bool { return pq[i].length < pq[j].length }
func (pq PriorityQueue) Swap(i, j int)      { pq[i], pq[j] = pq[j], pq[i] }

func (pq *PriorityQueue) Push(x interface{}) {
	*pq = append(*pq, x.(*Path))
}

func (pq *PriorityQueue) Pop() interface{} {
	old := *pq
	n := len(old)
	x := old[n-1]
	*pq = old[0 : n-1]
	return x
}

func Minpath(grid [][]int, k int) []int {
	pq := &PriorityQueue{}
	for i := 0; i < len(grid); i++ {
		for j := 0; j < len(grid[0]); j++ {
			p := &Path{Cell{i, j}, []int{grid[i][j]}, 1}
			heap.Push(pq, p)
		}
	}
	minPath := heap.Pop(pq).(*Path)
	for i := 1; i < k; i++ {
		minPath.length++
		heap.Push(pq, minPath)
		minPath = heap.Pop(pq).(*Path)
	}
	return minPath.list
}

func main() {
	grid := [][]int{{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {
