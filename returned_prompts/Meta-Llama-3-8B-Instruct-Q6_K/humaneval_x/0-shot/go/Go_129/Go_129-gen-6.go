You can use a greedy strategy to solve this problem. The idea is to always choose the cell with the smallest value in the next step.

Here is a simple implementation in Go:
```go
func Minpath(grid [][]int, k int) []int {
    m, n := len(grid), len(grid[0])
    res := make([]int, k)
    for i := 0; i < k; i++ {
        min := math.MaxInt
        minIndex := -1
        for j := 0; j < m; j++ {
            for _, v := range grid[j] {
                if v < min && v != res[i] {
                    min = v
                    minIndex = j
                }
            }
        }
        res[i] = grid[minIndex][0]
        grid[minIndex] = append([]int{minIndex + 1}, grid[minIndex][1:])
    }
    return res
}
```
The algorithm works as follows:

1. Initialize an empty result array `res` of size `k`.
2. For each step `i` from 0 to `k-1`, find the cell with the smallest value in the grid that has not been visited yet (i.e., its value is not in `res[i]`). If there are multiple cells with the same smallest value, choose one of them arbitrarily.
3. Set the value of `res[i]` to the value of the chosen cell.
4. Remove the chosen cell from the grid by replacing it with a new cell that contains the next index value (i.e., `minIndex + 1`).
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until `k` steps have been taken.
6. Return the result array `res`.

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(m \* n \* k), where `m` and `n` are the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively. The space complexity is O(k), since we need to store the result array of size `k`. Note that this algorithm assumes that the input grid is a 2D slice of integers, where each row has the same length. If the grid has a different structure, you may need to modify the algorithm accordingly.
