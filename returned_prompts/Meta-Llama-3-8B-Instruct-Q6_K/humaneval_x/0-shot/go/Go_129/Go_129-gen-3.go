The problem is to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. The minimum path is defined as the path that visits the cells in the lexicographically smallest order.

Here is a solution using depth-first search (DFS):

```go
func Minpath(grid [][]int, k int) []int {
    m, n := len(grid), len(grid[0])
    res := make([]int, k)
    var dfs func(int, int, []int, int)
    dfs = func(i, j int, path []int, k int) {
        if k == 0 {
            res = path
            return
        }
        for _, d := range [][2]int{{-1, 0}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {0, 1}} {
            ni, nj := i + d[0], j + d[1]
            if ni >= 0 && ni < m && nj >= 0 && nj < n && !contains(path, grid[ni][nj]) {
                dfs(ni, nj, append(path, grid[ni][nj]), k-1)
            }
        }
    }
    for i := 0; i < m; i++ {
        for j := 0; j < n; j++ {
            dfs(i, j, []int{grid[i][j]}, k)
            if res != nil {
                break
            }
        }
        if res != nil {
            break
        }
    }
    return res
}

func contains(path []int, x int) bool {
    for _, v := range path {
        if v == x {
            return true
        }
    }
    return false
}
```

In this solution, we use a DFS function to explore the grid. The DFS function takes four parameters: the current cell's coordinates, the current path, and the remaining length of the path. If the remaining length is 0, we update the result with the current path. Otherwise, we explore the neighbor cells and recursively call the DFS function with the updated path and remaining length.

We also use a helper function `contains` to check if a value is already in the path.

Finally, we iterate over all cells in the grid and call the DFS function. The first path that is found is returned as the result. If no path is found, the function returns an empty slice.

This solution has a time complexity of O(N^k), where N is the size of
