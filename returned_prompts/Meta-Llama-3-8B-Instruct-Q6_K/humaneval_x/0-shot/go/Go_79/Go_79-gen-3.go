Here is a simple function in Go that converts a decimal number to a binary string with the extra 'db' characters at the beginning and end:

```go
func DecimalToBinary(decimal int) string {
    binary := fmt.Sprintf("%b", decimal)
    return "db" + strings.Repeat("0", len(binary)) + binary + strings.Repeat("0", len(binary)) + "db"
}
```

In this function, `fmt.Sprintf("%b", decimal)` is used to convert the decimal number to a binary string. The `strings.Repeat("0", len(binary))` is used to add leading zeros to the binary string to make it the same length as the desired output. The "db" characters are added at the beginning and end of the binary string to match the desired output. 

Note: The `strings` package in Go is used for string manipulation. If you haven't imported it yet, you need to add `import "strings"` at the top of your file. 

Also, the `%b` format specifier in `fmt.Sprintf` is used to format a number as a binary number. It is a shorthand for `%b` which is a binary number in the format "0b1010". The `%b` format specifier is used to format a number as a binary number without the "0b" prefix. 

Finally, the `Repeat` function from the `strings` package is used to repeat a string a specified number of times. In this case, it is used to add leading zeros to the binary string. 

You can test this function with the examples you provided:

```go
fmt.Println(DecimalToBinary(15))   // prints "db1111db"
fmt.Println(DecimalToBinary(32))   // prints "db100000db"
```
