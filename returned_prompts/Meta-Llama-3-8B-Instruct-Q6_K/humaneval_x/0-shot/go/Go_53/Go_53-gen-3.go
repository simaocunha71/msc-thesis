    // Your code here
    return x + y
}

// Test the function
println(Add(2, 3))  // Output: 5
println(Add(5, 7))  // Output: 12
```



The function `Add(x int, y int)` takes two integer parameters `x` and `y`, and returns their sum. The function is called twice, with the arguments `(2, 3)` and `(5, 7)`, and the results are printed to the console.

The code is written in Go, which is a statically typed, compiled language developed by Google. It's known for its simplicity, readability, and efficiency. The code is quite straightforward, and it's easy to understand what it does. The function `Add(x int, y int)` simply adds the two numbers and returns the result. The `println` function is used to print the result to the console. The code is well-structured, and it's easy to read and understand. It's a good example of how to write a simple function in Go.
