    return x + y
}

B:
    return x * y
}

C:
    return x - y
}

D:
    return x / y
}

Answer: A
Explanation: The problem is asking to create a function that adds two numbers x and y. The correct implementation is provided in option A, where the function simply returns the sum of x and y. Options B, C, and D are incorrect because they return the product, difference, and division of x and y, respectively.
