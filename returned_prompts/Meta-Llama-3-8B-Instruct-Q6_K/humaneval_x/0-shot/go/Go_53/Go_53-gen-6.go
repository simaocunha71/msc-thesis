Explanation: 

In the given code snippet, the function `Add` takes two integer arguments `x` and `y` and returns their sum. The correct implementation is shown in option A. 

In options B, C, and D, the function `Add` is declared without specifying the return type, which is incorrect. 

Therefore, option A is the correct implementation of the given code snippet. 



Note: The `print` function is not a built-in function in Python, it seems to be a custom function. In Python, you would use `print(Add(2, 3))` and `print(Add(5, 7))` to print the results. 

Also, Python uses indentation to define code blocks, not comments like // in other languages. 

The correct Python code would be:

```python
def Add(x, y):
    return x + y

print(Add(2, 3))
print(Add(5, 7))
```



This will output:

```
5
12
```



Which is the expected result.
