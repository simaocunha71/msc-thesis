    return x + y
}  // Return the sum of x and y

```

Python version:

```Python
def Add(x, y):
    return x + y
```  // Return the sum of x and y

The Add function takes two integers as inputs, adds them together, and returns the result. This is a simple function that can be used to add any two numbers. It is a basic example of a function in a programming language.  It can be used in a program like this:

```Python
print(Add(2, 3))  // Output: 5
print(Add(5, 7))  // Output: 12
```  // Print the result of adding 2 and 3, and then 5 and 7.  The result is printed to the console.  It is a simple program that demonstrates the use of a function in Python.  It can be run by saving it to a file, such as `add.py`, and then running it with the command `python add.py`.  The output will be `5` and `12`, which are the results of adding 2 and 3, and 5 and 7, respectively.  This is a simple example of how a function can be used in a program.  The function can be used to add any two numbers, not just 2 and 3, or 5 and 7.  It can be used anywhere in the program where an addition is needed.  It is a reusable piece of code that makes the program more efficient and easier to read.  It is a good example of the concept of modularity, which is a key principle of programming.  It is a way to break down a complex program into smaller, more manageable pieces, each of which performs a specific task.  This makes the program easier to understand, maintain, and modify.  It is a way to make the program more efficient and easier to use.  It is a key concept in programming that is used in many different programming languages.  It is a way to write code that is easy to read, understand, and modify.  It is a way to make the program more efficient and easier to use.
