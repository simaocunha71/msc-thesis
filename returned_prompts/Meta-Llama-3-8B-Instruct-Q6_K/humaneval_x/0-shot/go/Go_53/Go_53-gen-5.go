    return x + y

}

In this code, the function `Add` takes two integers `x` and `y` as arguments and returns their sum. The function is defined with two integer parameters `x` and `y` and returns an integer. The function is called with different arguments and the results are printed.

The code is written in Go, a statically typed, compiled, and designed to be concurrent language. In this code, the `Add` function is defined and called with different arguments. The `Add` function simply returns the sum of `x` and `y`.

The output of this code will be:

```
5
12
```



This is a simple program that adds two numbers and prints the result. The function `Add` takes two integer arguments `x` and `y` and returns their sum. The `main` function calls `Add` with different arguments and prints the result. The output is the sum of the two numbers. This program demonstrates the basic syntax of Go and how to define and call a function.
