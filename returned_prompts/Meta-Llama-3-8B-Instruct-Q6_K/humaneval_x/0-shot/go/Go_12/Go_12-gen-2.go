```go
func Longest(strings []string) interface{} {
    if len(strings) == 0 {
        return nil
    }
    longest := strings[0]
    for _, s := range strings[1:] {
        if len(s) > len(longest) {
            longest = s
        }
    }
    return longest
}
```


This function takes a slice of strings as an input and returns the longest string in the slice. If the input slice is empty, it returns nil. If there are multiple strings of the same length, it returns the first one it encounters. 

Here is a breakdown of how it works:

1. Check if the input slice is empty. If it is, return nil.
2. Initialize the longest string to the first string in the slice.
3. Iterate over the rest of the strings in the slice (starting from the second string).
4. For each string, check if its length is greater than the length of the current longest string. If it is, update the longest string.
5. After iterating over all the strings, return the longest string.

Note that the return type of this function is interface{}, which means it can return values of any type. In this case, it returns a string (or nil). The function uses the type of the first string in the slice as the type of the return value, which is why it works correctly even if the longest string is not the first one in the slice. 

You can test this function with the examples you provided:

```go
fmt.Println(Longest([]string{})) // Output: nil
fmt.Println(Longest([]string{"a", "b", "c"})) // Output: a
fmt.Println(Longest([]string{"a", "bb", "ccc"})) // Output: ccc
```


This function is case-sensitive, so it considers "a" and "A" as different strings. If you want to make it case-insensitive, you can convert all the strings to lower case or upper case before comparing their lengths. Here is how you can modify the function to make it case-insensitive:

```go
func Longest(strings []string) interface{} {
    if len(strings) == 0 {
        return nil
    }
    longest := strings[0]
    for _, s := range strings[1:] {
        if len(strings.ToLower(s)) > len(strings.ToLower(longest)) {
            longest = s
        }
    }
    return longest
}
```
