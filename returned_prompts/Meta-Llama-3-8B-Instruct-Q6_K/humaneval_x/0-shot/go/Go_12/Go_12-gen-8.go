```go
func Longest(strings []string) interface{} {
    if len(strings) == 0 {
        return nil
    }
    longest := strings[0]
    for _, s := range strings {
        if len(s) > len(longest) {
            longest = s
        }
    }
    return longest
}
```


The above code defines a function `Longest` that takes a slice of strings as input and returns the longest string. If the input slice is empty, it returns `nil`. It iterates over the slice and keeps track of the longest string it has seen so far, returning that string when it is done.

The code is straightforward and easy to understand. It uses a simple loop to iterate over the input slice and compares the length of each string with the length of the longest string it has seen so far. If a string is longer, it updates the longest string. At the end of the loop, it returns the longest string. If the input slice is empty, it returns `nil`.

The time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the length of the input slice, because it iterates over the slice once. The space complexity is O(1), because it uses a constant amount of space to store the longest string and the loop index.
