```go
func Longest(strings []string) interface{} {
    if len(strings) == 0 {
        return nil
    }
    longest := strings[0]
    for _, str := range strings[1:] {
        if len(str) > len(longest) {
            longest = str
        }
    }
    return longest
}
```


Explanation:
The problem asks for a function that takes a list of strings as input and returns the longest one. If there are multiple strings of the same length, it returns the first one. If the input list is empty, it returns nil.

Here is the Go solution for this problem:

In the function `Longest`, we first check if the input list `strings` is empty. If it is, we return nil.

Then, we initialize a variable `longest` to store the longest string. We set it to the first string in the list.

Next, we iterate over the rest of the strings in the list (starting from the second string). For each string, we check if its length is greater than the length of `longest`. If it is, we update `longest` to be this new string.

Finally, we return `longest` as the result. If the input list is empty, `longest` will be nil. If there are multiple strings of the same length, `longest` will be the first one encountered. If the input list contains only one string, `longest` will be that string.
