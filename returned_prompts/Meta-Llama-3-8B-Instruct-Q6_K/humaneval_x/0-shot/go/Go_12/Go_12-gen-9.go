```go
func Longest(strings []string) interface{} {
    if len(strings) == 0 {
        return nil
    }
    longest := strings[0]
    for _, s := range strings {
        if len(s) > len(longest) {
            longest = s
        }
    }
    return longest
}
```

Explanation:
The function Longest takes a slice of strings as input and returns the longest string. If the input slice is empty, it returns nil. 

First, it checks if the input slice is empty. If it is, it returns nil. 

Then, it initializes the variable longest to the first string in the slice. 

Next, it iterates over the rest of the slice and checks if the current string is longer than the longest string found so far. If it is, it updates the longest string. 

Finally, it returns the longest string. 

In the case of multiple strings of the same length, the function returns the first one it encounters. 

This function uses a simple and efficient approach to find the longest string in the input slice. It has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input slice, and a space complexity of O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the longest string and a loop variable.
