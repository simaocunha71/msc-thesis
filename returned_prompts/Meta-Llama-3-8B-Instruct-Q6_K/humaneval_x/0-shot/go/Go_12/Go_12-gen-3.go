```go
func Longest(strings []string) interface{} {
    if len(strings) == 0 {
        return nil
    }
    longest := strings[0]
    for _, s := range strings {
        if len(s) > len(longest) {
            longest = s
        }
    }
    return longest
}
```


Here is a simple function that takes a slice of strings as input and returns the longest string. If the input slice is empty, it returns `nil`. If there are multiple strings of the same length, it returns the first one. 

The function iterates over the input slice, keeping track of the longest string it has seen so far. If it finds a string that is longer than the current longest, it updates the longest string. At the end of the function, it returns the longest string. 

Note that the function returns an `interface{}` type, which allows it to return either a string or `nil`. This is because the function may return `nil` if the input slice is empty, but it also needs to return a string if the slice is not empty. 

Here is an example of how you might use this function:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func Longest(strings []string) interface{} {
    if len(strings) == 0 {
        return nil
    }
    longest := strings[0]
    for _, s := range strings {
        if len(s) > len(longest) {
            longest = s
        }
    }
    return longest
}

func main() {
    strings := []string{"a", "bb", "ccc"}
    result := Longest(strings)
    fmt.Println(result) // Output: "ccc"
}
```


This will print "ccc" to the console, which is the longest string in the input slice. If the input slice were empty, the function would return `nil`. If there were multiple strings of the same length, the function would return the first one it encountered.
