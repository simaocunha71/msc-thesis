```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func SpecialFactorial(n int) int {
	result := 1
	for i := 1; i <= n; i++ {
		factorial := 1
		for j := 1; j <= i; j++ {
			factorial *= j
		}
		result *= factorial
	}
	return result
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(SpecialFactorial(4))  // Output: 288
}
```

Explanation:
The provided Go code calculates the Brazilian factorial of a given integer `n`. The Brazilian factorial is defined as the product of all factorials from `n` down to `1`.

In the `SpecialFactorial` function, a nested loop is used to calculate the factorial of each number from `1` to `n`. The outer loop iterates `n` times, and for each iteration, the inner loop calculates the factorial of the current number `i`. The result is then updated by multiplying it with the current factorial.

In the `main` function, we call `SpecialFactorial` with the argument `4` and print the result, which is `288`.

Note: The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) because of the nested loops. For large values of `n`, this function may take a significant amount of time to complete. A more efficient solution could be implemented using mathematical properties of factorials, but this would be more complex.
