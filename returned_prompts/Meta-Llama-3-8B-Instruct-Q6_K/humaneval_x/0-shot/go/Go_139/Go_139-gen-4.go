Here is the solution:

```go
func SpecialFactorial(n int) int {
    result := 1
    factorial := 1
    for i := 1; i <= n; i++ {
        factorial *= i
        result *= factorial
    }
    return result
}
```

This function calculates the Brazilian factorial of a given integer `n`. It initializes a variable `result` to `1` and a variable `factorial` to `1`. Then, it enters a loop that runs from `1` to `n`. In
