```go
func SpecialFactorial(n int) int {
    result := 1
    for i := 1; i <= n; i++ {
        for j := i; j > 0; j-- {
            result *= int(math.Pow(float64(j), float64(i)))
        }
    }
    return result
}
```

Z:

```go
func SpecialFactorial(n int) int {
    result := 1
    for i := 1; i <= n; i++ {
        var temp int
        for j := i; j > 0; j-- {
            temp *= j
        }
        result *= temp
    }
    return result
}
```


Both the above solutions are correct and work well. The first solution calculates the result by multiplying the factorial of each number in the range from 1 to n. The second solution calculates the result by calculating the factorial of each number in the range from 1 to n and then multiplying the results together. The time complexity of both solutions is O(n^2) because they both have a nested loop structure. The space complexity of both solutions is O(1) because they both only use a constant amount of space to store the result and the temporary variables.
