```go
func GetPositive(l []int) []int {
    var result []int
    for _, v := range l {
        if v > 0 {
            result = append(result, v)
        }
    }
    return result
}
```



Explanation:
This function takes a slice of integers as input and returns a new slice containing only the positive numbers from the original slice.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the function works:

1. Initialize an empty slice `result` that will store the positive numbers.
2. Iterate over the input slice `l` using a `for` loop with a range clause.
3. For each element `v` in the input slice, check if it's greater than 0 using an `if` statement.
4. If `v` is positive, append it to the `result` slice using the `append` function.
5. After iterating over the entire input slice, return the `result` slice containing the positive numbers.

The function uses the `range` clause to iterate over the input slice, which allows us to access each element `v` in the slice without having to use an index. The `append` function is used to add each positive number to the `result` slice, which is initialized as an empty slice at the beginning of the function.

The function is designed to be efficient and easy to understand, making it suitable for use in a variety of applications where you need to extract positive numbers from a slice of integers.
