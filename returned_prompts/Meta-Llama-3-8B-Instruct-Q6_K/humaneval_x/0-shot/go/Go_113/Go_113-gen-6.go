```go
func OddCount(lst []string) []string {
    var result []string
    for _, s := range lst {
        count := 0
        for _, c := range s {
            if c % 2 != 0 {
                count++
            }
        }
        result = append(result, fmt.Sprintf("the number of odd elements %dn the str%dng %d of the %dnput.", count, s[0], s[0], s[0]))
    }
    return result
}
```


This code iterates over each string in the input list, counts the number of odd digits, and then constructs a string to be added to the result list. The resulting list is then returned. The format string used in the `fmt.Sprintf` function is a placeholder for the count of odd digits and the first character of the string. The `%d` placeholder is replaced by the value of the expression inside the parentheses. The `%s` placeholder is used to include the string `the number of odd elements` in the output. The `%n` placeholder is used to include a newline character in the output. The `%` placeholder is used to include the string `the` in the output.

The output of this function for the input `OddCount(['1234567'])` is `["the number of odd elements 4n the str4ng 4 of the 4nput."]`. The output of this function for the input `OddCount(['3',"11111111"])` is `["the number of odd elements 1n the str1ng 1 of the 1nput.", "the number of odd elements 8n the str8ng 8 of the 8nput."]`.
