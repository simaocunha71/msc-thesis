The function `Intersection` takes two intervals as input, each represented as a pair of integers. It calculates the start and end points of the intersection of the two intervals, and then checks if the length of the intersection is a prime number. 

The function first calculates the start and end points of the intersection by taking the maximum of the two start points and the minimum of the two end points. If the start point is greater than the end point, it means that the intervals do not intersect, and the function returns "NO".

Next, the function calculates the length of the intersection by subtracting the start point from the end point and adding 1. It then checks if the length is a prime number by iterating from 2 to the square root of the length and checking if the length is divisible by any of these numbers. If the length is divisible, it is not a prime number, and the function returns "NO". If the length is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is a prime number, and the function returns "YES". 

This function correctly identifies whether the length of the intersection of two intervals is a prime number. 

Note: The input intervals are closed, and the start of each interval is less than or equal to its end. The function assumes these conditions. 

Example inputs and outputs:
- Intersection((1, 2), (2, 3)) returns "NO" because the length of the intersection (1, 2) is 1, which is not a prime number.
- Intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4)) returns "NO" because the intervals do not intersect.
- Intersection((-3, -1), (-5, 5)) returns "YES" because the length of the intersection (-3, -1) is 3, which is a prime number. 
- Intersection((0, 2), (1, 4)) returns
