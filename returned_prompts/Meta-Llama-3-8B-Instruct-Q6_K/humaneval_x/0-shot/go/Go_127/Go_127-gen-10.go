    // Check if the length is a prime number

Explanation:

This function calculates the intersection of the two given intervals, checks if it's empty, and if not, checks if its length is a prime number. The intersection is calculated by finding the maximum of the two starts and the minimum of the two ends. If the start is greater than the end, it means the intervals don't intersect, so the function returns "NO". Otherwise, it calculates the length of the intersection and checks if it's a prime number by iterating from 2 to the square root of the length and checking if the length is divisible by any of these numbers. If the length is not a prime number, the function returns "NO", otherwise it returns "YES".


Time complexity: O(sqrt(n)) where n is the length of the intersection, which is the maximum of the two ends minus the minimum of the two starts plus 1. The space complexity is O(1) as it only uses a constant amount of space.
