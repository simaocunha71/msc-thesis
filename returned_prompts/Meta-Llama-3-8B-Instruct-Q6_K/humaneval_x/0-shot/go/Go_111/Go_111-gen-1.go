Here is a Go solution for the problem:

```go
import (
    "strings"
    "fmt"
)

func Histogram(test string) map[rune]int {
    if test == "" {
        return nil
    }
    words := strings.Split(test, " ")
    count := make(map[rune]int)
    for _, word := range words {
        for _, char := range word {
            count[char]++
        }
    }
    maxCount := 0
    var maxChars []rune
    for char, c := range count {
        if c > maxCount {
            maxCount = c
            maxChars = []rune{char}
        } else if c == maxCount {
            maxChars = append(maxChars, char)
        }
    }
    result := make(map[rune]int)
    for _, char := range maxChars {
        result[char] = maxCount
    }
    return result
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(Histogram("a b c")) // Output: map[a:1 b:1 c:1]
    fmt.Println(Histogram("a b b a")) // Output: map[a:2 b:2]
    fmt.Println(Histogram("a b c a b")) // Output: map[a:2 b:2]
    fmt.Println(Histogram("b b b b a")) // Output: map[b:4]
    fmt.Println(Histogram("")) // Output: map[]
}
```

This program splits the input string into words, then for each word, it counts the occurrences of each character. It keeps track of the maximum count and the characters that have this count. Finally, it creates a new map with the characters that have the maximum count and their corresponding count. If the input string is empty, it returns an empty map. The result is a map of characters to their counts. The main function tests the Histogram function with some examples. The output of these tests is printed to the console. The output is a map of characters to their counts. If there are multiple characters with the same maximum count, they are all included in the output map. If the input string is empty, the output is an empty map. The output map is a dictionary of the letter with the most repetition and containing the corresponding count. If several letters have the same occurrence, return all of them.  The output is a map of characters to their counts. If there are multiple characters with the same maximum count, they are all included in the output map. If the
