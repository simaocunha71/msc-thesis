Explanation:
The `Histogram` function splits the input string into individual words and then iterates over each word to count the occurrences of each character. It keeps track of the maximum count and the characters that have this count. Finally, it returns a map where the keys are the characters that have the maximum count and the values are the maximum count.

In the `main` function, we test the `Histogram` function with different input strings and print the results. The output is as expected, showing the characters with the most repetition and their corresponding counts.

Note that the function returns a map where the keys are runes (which are equivalent to single characters) and the values are the counts. If two or more characters have the same maximum count, they are all included in the result map. If the input string is empty, the function returns an empty map.
