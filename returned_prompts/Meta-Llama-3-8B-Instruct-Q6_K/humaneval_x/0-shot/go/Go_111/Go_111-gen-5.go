The function Histogram takes a string as an argument, splits it into words, and counts the occurrences of each rune in each word. It then finds the maximum count and all the runes with this count. The result is a map where the keys are the runes and the values are their counts. If there are multiple runes with the same maximum count, all of them are included in the result. If the input string is empty, an empty map is returned. The main function tests the Histogram function with different inputs. The results are printed to the console. The output of each test is a map where the keys are the runes and the values are their counts. If there are multiple runes with the same maximum count, all of them are included in the result. If the input string is empty, an empty map is returned. The main function tests the Histogram function with different inputs. The results are printed to the console.
