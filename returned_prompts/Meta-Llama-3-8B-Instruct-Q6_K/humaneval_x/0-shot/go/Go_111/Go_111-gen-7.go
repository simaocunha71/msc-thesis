Explanation:

The function `Histogram` takes a string as input, splits it into words using the `strings.Split` function, and then iterates over each word and its characters to count the occurrences of each letter. The counts are stored in a map `counts` with the letter as the key and the count as the value.

To find the letter with the most repetition, we initialize `maxCount` to 0 and `maxCountLetters` to an empty slice. We then iterate over the `counts` map and update `maxCount` and `maxCountLetters` accordingly.

Finally, we create a new map `result` and populate it with the letters that have the maximum count. If there are multiple letters with the same maximum count, they are all included in the result.

In the `main` function, we test the `Histogram` function with different input strings and print the results. The output is as expected for each test case.
