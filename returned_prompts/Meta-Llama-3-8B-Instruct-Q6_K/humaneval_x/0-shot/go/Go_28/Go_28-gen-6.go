The problem is asking to create a function that takes a list of strings as input and returns a single string that is the concatenation of all the input strings.

For example, if the input is `['a', 'b', 'c']`, the output should be `'abc'`.

Here is the solution:

```go
func Concatenate(strings []string) string {
    result := ""
    for _, s := range strings {
        result += s
    }
    return result
}
```

This function uses a for loop to iterate over the input strings. For each string, it appends the string to the `result` variable. Finally, it returns the `result` variable, which is the concatenation of all the input strings.
