```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "strings"
)

func Concatenate(strings []string) string {
    return strings.Join(strings, "")
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(Concatenate([]string{}))  // ''
    fmt.Println(Concatenate([]string{"a", "b", "c"}))  // 'abc'
}
```
The `strings.Join` function is used to concatenate the strings in the slice. The first argument is the slice of strings and the second argument is the separator to use. In this case, we are using an empty string as the separator, which means the strings will be concatenated without any separators. The function returns a new string that is the concatenation of all the strings in the slice. If the slice is empty, the function returns an empty string. The `main` function demonstrates this by printing the concatenation of an empty slice and a non-empty slice. Output: `'` and `'abc'`. 

Here is another way to do this without using `strings.Join`:

```go
func Concatenate(strings []string) string {
    var result string
    for _, s := range strings {
        result += s
    }
    return result
}
```

This function uses a for loop to iterate over the slice of strings. For each string, it appends the string to the `result` variable. The function returns the `result` variable, which is the concatenation of all the strings in the slice. If the slice is empty, the function returns an empty string. The `main` function demonstrates this by printing the concatenation of an empty slice and a non-empty slice. Output: `'` and `'abc'`. 

This approach is more verbose and less efficient than using `strings.Join`, but it may be useful if you don't have access to the `strings` package or if you need more control over the concatenation process. 

Note: In Go, strings are immutable, so the += operator creates a new string each time, which can be inefficient for large strings. The `strings.Join` function avoids this problem by building the result string in a single operation. If you need to concatenate a large number of strings, it's generally better to use `strings.Join`. 

Also, Go has a `strings.Builder` type that is designed for building strings incrementally. It is more efficient than using `+=` to concatenate strings, but it is not as simple to use as `strings.Join`.
