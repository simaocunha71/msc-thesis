```go
func BelowThreshold(l []int, t int) bool {
    for _, v := range l {
        if v >= t {
            return false
        }
    }
    return true
}
```



This function iterates over each element `v` in the list `l`. If it finds an element that is greater than or equal to the threshold `t`, it immediately returns `false`. If it iterates over the entire list without finding such an element, it returns `true`. The function stops as soon as it finds an element that exceeds the threshold, which makes it more efficient than checking all elements if they are below the threshold.  The function uses the range keyword to iterate over the array. In the loop, it checks if the current value is greater than or equal to the threshold. If it is, the function returns false. If the loop finishes without finding a value greater than or equal to the threshold, the function returns true. The function uses the for loop to iterate over each element in the list. The range keyword is used to iterate over the array, and the variable v is assigned the value of each element in the array. The if statement checks if the value is greater than or equal to the threshold, and if it is, the function returns false. If the function finishes the loop without returning false, it returns true. This function is case sensitive and will return true if any of the elements in the list are less than the threshold, regardless of their case. If you want to ignore case, you can convert both the list and the threshold to lowercase before comparing them. Here is how you can do it: 

```go
func BelowThreshold(l []int, t int) bool {
    for _, v := range l {
        if int64(v) >= int64(t) {
            return false
        }
    }
    return true
}
```



This function converts the list and the threshold to int64 before comparing them, so it will return true if any of the elements in the list are less than the threshold, regardless of their case.  The function uses the range keyword to iterate over the array. In the loop, it checks if the current value is greater than or equal to the threshold. If it is, the function returns false. If the loop finishes without finding a value greater than or equal to the threshold, the function returns true. The function uses the for loop to iterate over each element in the list.
