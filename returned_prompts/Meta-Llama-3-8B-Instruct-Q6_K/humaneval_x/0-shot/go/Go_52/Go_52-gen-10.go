```go
func BelowThreshold(l []int, t int) bool {
    for _, v := range l {
        if v >= t {
            return false
        }
    }
    return true
}
```
This function takes a slice of integers `l` and an integer `t` as input. It iterates over the slice using a range loop, checking each element `v` against the threshold `t`. If any element is greater than or equal to the threshold, the function immediately returns `false`. If the loop completes without finding such an element, the function returns `true`. This ensures that the function returns the correct result as soon as it finds an element that is above the threshold, rather than checking every element in the slice. This is an efficient way to solve this problem, especially for large slices.
