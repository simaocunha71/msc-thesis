```go
func FixSpaces(text string) string {
    var result string
    var count int
    for _, c := range text {
        if c == ' ' {
            count++
            if count > 2 {
                result += "-"
            } else {
                result += "_"
            }
        } else {
            result += string(c)
            count = 0
        }
    }
    return result
}
```



This Go function takes a string as input and replaces all spaces with underscores. It also replaces consecutive spaces with dashes if the count of consecutive spaces exceeds 2.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. Initialize an empty string `result` to store the modified string.
2. Initialize a counter `count` to 0 to keep track of consecutive spaces.
3. Iterate over each character `c` in the input string `text`.
4. If the character is a space (`c == ' '`), increment the `count` variable.
5. If the `count` variable exceeds 2, append a dash (`"-"`) to the `result` string. Otherwise, append an underscore (`"_"`) to the `result` string.
6. If the character is not a space, append the character to the `result` string and reset the `count` variable to 0.
7. Return the modified `result` string.

The function uses the `range` keyword to iterate over the characters in the input string, and the `string(c)` function to convert the character to a string before appending it to the `result` string. The `count` variable is used to keep track of consecutive spaces and decide whether to append a dash or an underscore to the `result` string.
