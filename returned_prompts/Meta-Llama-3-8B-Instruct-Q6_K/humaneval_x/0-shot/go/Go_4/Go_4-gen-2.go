Here is the solution to the problem:

```go
import (
    "math"
)

// For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
// around the mean of this dataset.
// Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
// element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
// MAD = average | x - x_mean |
// >>> MeanAbsoluteDeviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
// 1.0
func MeanAbsoluteDeviation(numbers []float64) float64 {
    // Calculate the mean of the dataset
    mean := math.NaN()
    for _, num := range numbers {
        if math.IsNaN(mean) {
            mean = num
        } else {
            mean += num
        }
    }
    mean /= float64(len(numbers))

    // Calculate the absolute deviation from the mean
    var deviation float64
    for _, num := range numbers {
        deviation += math.Abs(num - mean)
    }
    deviation /= float64(len(numbers))

    return deviation
}
```

In this solution, we first calculate the mean of the input numbers by summing all the numbers and then dividing by the number of elements. Then, we calculate the absolute deviation from the mean by summing the absolute differences between each number and the mean, and then dividing by the number of elements. The result is the Mean Absolute Deviation. The function uses the math package to perform mathematical operations like summing, dividing and calculating absolute values. It also uses a for loop to iterate over the input numbers. The mean is calculated as the sum of all numbers divided by the number of elements. The absolute deviation is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between each number and the mean, divided by the number of elements. The function returns the Mean Absolute Deviation. The Mean Absolute Deviation is calculated as the average absolute difference between each element and the mean of the dataset. This is a measure of the spread of the data from the mean. It is a robust measure of spread that is not affected by extreme values. It is often used in statistics and data analysis. The Mean Absolute Deviation is a measure of the average distance from the mean, and it can be used to compare the spread of different datasets. It is often used in finance and economics to measure the spread of stock prices or returns. It is also used in medicine to measure the spread of patient outcomes. It is a widely used measure of spread
