Here is the Python solution for the problem:

```Python
def MeanAbsoluteDeviation(numbers):
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    return sum(abs(num - mean) for num in numbers) / len(numbers)
```

The function calculates the mean of the input numbers first, then it calculates the absolute deviation of each number from the mean and returns the average of these deviations. The absolute deviation is calculated as `abs(num - mean)`. The average of these deviations is calculated as `sum(abs(num - mean) for num in numbers) / len(numbers)`. This is the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of the input numbers.

In the given Python code:

- We first calculate the mean of the input numbers using the `sum` function to add up all the numbers and then dividing by the length of the list (`len(numbers)`).
- Then, we calculate the absolute deviation of each number from the mean using a generator expression inside the `sum` function. This expression calculates `abs(num - mean)` for each number in the list.
- Finally, we return the average of these absolute deviations, which is the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of the input numbers. This is calculated by dividing the sum of the absolute deviations by the length of the list.

The given Python code is a simple and efficient way to calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation of a list of numbers. It has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of input numbers, because it needs to iterate over the list once to calculate the mean and the absolute deviations. The space complexity is O(1), because it only needs a constant amount of space to store the mean and the sum of the absolute deviations.
