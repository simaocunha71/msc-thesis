```go
func WillItFly(q []int, w int) bool {
    // Check if q is balanced
    for i, v := range q {
        if v != q[len(q)-i-1] {
            return false
        }
    }
    // Check if the sum of q is less than or equal to w
    sum := 0
    for _, v := range q {
        sum += v
    }
    return sum <= w
}
```


The function `WillItFly` takes two parameters: `q`, which is a slice of integers representing the object's elements, and `w`, which is the maximum possible weight. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the object will fly.

First, the function checks if the object is balanced by iterating over the slice `q` and comparing each element with the corresponding element from the end of the slice. If any pair of elements is not equal, the function immediately returns `false`.

If the object is balanced, the function calculates the sum of its elements by iterating over the slice `q` and adding each element to a running total `sum`. Finally, the function returns `true` if the sum is less than or equal to `w`, and `false` otherwise.
