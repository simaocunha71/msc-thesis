Explanation:
The function `WillItFly` takes two inputs: `q` (a slice of integers representing the object's elements) and `w` (the maximum possible weight). It returns a boolean indicating whether the object will fly.

First, we check if the object is balanced by comparing the elements from the start and end of the slice. If any pair of elements doesn't match, we immediately return `false`.

Next, we calculate the sum of the object's elements and check if it's less than or equal to the maximum possible weight `w`. If the sum is greater than `w`, we return `false`.

If both conditions are met, we return `true`, indicating that the object will fly.

The provided examples demonstrate the function's behavior:
- `WillItFly([1, 2], 5)` returns `false` because the object is unbalanced.
- `WillItFly([3, 2, 3], 1)` returns `false` because the object is balanced but the sum exceeds the maximum weight.
- `WillItFly([3, 2, 3], 9)` returns `true` because the object is balanced and the sum is within the maximum weight.
- `WillItFly([3], 5)` returns `true` because the object is balanced and the sum is within the maximum weight.
