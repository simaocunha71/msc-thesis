```go
func WillItFly(q []int, w int) bool {
    // Check if the list is balanced (palindromic)
    for i := 0; i < len(q)/2; i++ {
        if q[i] != q[len(q)-1-i] {
            return false
        }
    }

    // Check if the sum of the elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight
    sum := 0
    for _, v := range q {
        sum += v
    }
    return sum <= w
}
```


The function `WillItFly` takes two parameters: `q` which is a slice of integers representing the object, and `w` which is an integer representing the maximum possible weight.

First, it checks if the object is balanced by iterating through the slice and comparing each element with the corresponding element from the end of the slice. If any pair of elements does not match, the function returns `false` because the object is not balanced.

Then, it calculates the sum of the elements in the slice by iterating through the slice and adding each element to a variable `sum`. If the sum is greater than the maximum possible weight `w`, the function returns `false`. Otherwise, it returns `true`.
