```go
func WillItFly(q []int, w int) bool {
    // Check if the list is balanced (palindromic)
    for i, j := 0, len(q)-1; i < j; i, j = i+1, j-1 {
        if q[i] != q[j] {
            return false
        }
    }
    // Check if the sum of the elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight
    sum := 0
    for _, v := range q {
        sum += v
    }
    return sum <= w
}
```


Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. We first check if the list `q` is balanced by iterating through the list and checking if each element matches the corresponding element from the end of the list. If any pair doesn't match, we return `false`.
2. If the list is balanced, we calculate the sum of its elements.
3. Finally, we return `true` if the sum is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight `w`, and `false` otherwise.

This function should work correctly for the given examples and any other inputs that satisfy the conditions.
