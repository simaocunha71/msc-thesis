```go

	"strconv"
	"strings"
)

func FruitDistribution(s string, n int) int {
	// Split the string into two parts: apples and oranges
	parts := strings.Split(s, " and ")
	apples, _ := strconv.Atoi(strings.Split(parts[0], " ")[0])
	oranges, _ := strconv.Atoi(strings.Split(parts[1], " ")[0])

	// Calculate the total number of mango fruits
	return n - apples - oranges
}

func main() {
	// Test cases
	fmt.Println(FruitDistribution("5 apples and 6 oranges", 19)) // 8
	fmt.Println(FruitDistribution("0 apples and 1 oranges", 3)) // 2
	fmt.Println(FruitDistribution("2 apples and 3 oranges", 100)) // 95
	fmt.Println(FruitDistribution("100 apples and 1 oranges", 120)) // 19
}
```


The FruitDistribution function takes a string and an integer as input. The string represents the total number of apples and oranges distributed in the basket, and the integer represents the total number of fruits in the basket.

The function splits the string into two parts: apples and oranges, and then converts these strings into integers using the strconv.Atoi function. It then calculates the total number of mango fruits by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits.

The function is tested with several test cases in the main function. The test cases are:

- "5 apples and 6 oranges" and 19
- "0 apples and 1 oranges" and 3
- "2 apples and 3 oranges" and 100
- "100 apples and 1 oranges" and 120

The output of the function is printed for each test case. For example, the output for the test case "5 apples and 6 oranges" and 19 is 8, which is the correct result. The function works correctly for all test cases.
