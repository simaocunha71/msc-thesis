```A) This function calculates the total number of characters in each list by iterating through each string in the list and adding its length to the total. It then compares the two totals and returns the list with the lower total. If the totals are equal, it returns the first list. This function does not modify the original lists. It returns a new list that meets the condition. The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the total number of strings in both lists. The space complexity is O(1) as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the totals.
