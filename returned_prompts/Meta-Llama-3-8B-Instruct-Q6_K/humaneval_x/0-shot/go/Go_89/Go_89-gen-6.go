Here is a simple implementation in Go:

```go
package main

import (
    "strings"
)

func Encrypt(s string) string {
    result := ""
    for _, char := range s {
        if char >= 'a' && char <= 'z' {
            result += string((char - 'a' + 4) % 26 + 'a')
        } else if char >= 'A' && char <= 'Z' {
            result += string((char - 'A' + 4) % 26 + 'A')
        } else {
            result += string(char)
        }
    }
    return result
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(Encrypt("hi"))  // prints "lm"
    fmt.Println(Encrypt("asdfghjkl"))  // prints "ewhjklnop"
    fmt.Println(Encrypt("gf"))  // prints "kj"
    fmt.Println(Encrypt("et"))  // prints "ix"
}
```

This program works by iterating over each character in the input string. If the character is a lowercase letter, it shifts it down by 4 places in the alphabet. If the character is an uppercase letter, it also shifts it down by 4 places. If the character is not a letter, it just leaves it as is. The result is a new string where all the letters have been shifted down by 4 places. The `main` function demonstrates this by encrypting the input strings "hi", "asdfghjkl", "gf", and "et". The `fmt.Println` statements print the encrypted strings to the console.  The `% 26` operation ensures that the shift wraps around the alphabet, so that 'z' shifts to 'a' and 'A' shifts to 'A'.  The `(char - 'a' + 4) % 26 + 'a'` expression calculates the new character position for a lowercase letter, and `(char - 'A' + 4) % 26 + 'A'` does the same for an uppercase letter.  The `string(char)` expression converts the new character position back to a character.  The `result += string((char - 'a' + 4) % 26 + 'a')` expression appends this character to the result string.  This is done for each character in the input string.  The final result is a new string where all the letters have been shifted down by 4 places.  The `main` function
