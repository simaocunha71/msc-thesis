```go
func Intersperse(numbers []int, delimeter int) []int {
    result := make([]int, len(numbers)*2-1)
    j := 0
    for _, num := range numbers {
        result[j] = num
        j++
        if j < len(result) {
            result[j] = delimeter
            j++
        }
    }
    return result
}
```


This function creates a new slice `result` with length `len(numbers)*2-1`, which is the maximum possible length of the output. It then iterates over the input slice `numbers`, copying each number into the result slice and inserting the delimiter in between.

Here is the explanation of the code:
- `result := make([]int, len(numbers)*2-1)`: This line creates a new slice `result` with length `len(numbers)*2-1`.
- `j := 0`: This line initializes a variable `j` to 0, which will be used to keep track of the current index in the result slice.
- `for _, num := range numbers`: This line starts a loop that iterates over the input slice `numbers`.
- `result[j] = num`: This line copies the current number from the input slice into the result slice.
- `j++`: This line increments the index `j` to move to the next position in the result slice.
- `if j < len(result)`: This line checks if the current index `j` is less than the length of the result slice.
- `result[j] = delimeter`: If the condition is true, this line inserts the delimiter into the result slice.
- `j++`: This line increments the index `j` to move to the next position in the result slice.
- `return result`: This line returns the result slice.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input slice. The space complexity is also O(n), as we are creating a new slice of the same length as the input slice.
