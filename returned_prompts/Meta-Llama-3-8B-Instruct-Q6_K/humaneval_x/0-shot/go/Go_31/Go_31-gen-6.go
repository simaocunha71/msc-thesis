The code snippet provided defines a function named `IsPrime` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether `n` is a prime number or not.

The function checks if `n` is less than 2, in which case it returns `false`, as prime numbers are greater than 1.

Then, it checks if `n` is 2, which is the only even prime number.

If `n` is greater than 2, the function checks if it is divisible by any number up to the square root of `n`. If it is divisible, it returns `false`, meaning `n` is not prime.

If `n` is not divisible by any of the numbers up to its square root, it is a prime number, and the function returns `true`.

Here is the corrected code:

```go
func IsPrime(n int) bool {
    if n < 2 {
        return false
    }
    if n == 2 {
        return true
    }
    if n%2 == 0 {
        return false
    }
    max := int(math.Sqrt(float64(n)))
    for i := 3; i <= max; i += 2 {
        if n%i == 0 {
            return false
        }
    }
    return true
}
```



For example, calling `IsPrime(6)` will return `false`, because 6 is not a prime number. Calling `IsPrime(101)` will return `true`, because 101 is a prime number. And so on.
