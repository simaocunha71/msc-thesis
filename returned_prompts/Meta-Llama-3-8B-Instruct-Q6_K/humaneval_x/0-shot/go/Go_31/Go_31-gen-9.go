```go
func IsPrime(n int) bool {
    if n <= 1 {
        return false
    }
    for i := 2; i*i <= n; i++ {
        if n%i == 0 {
            return false
        }
    }
    return true
}
```


Explanation:
The function IsPrime checks whether a given integer n is prime or not. 

1. If n is less than or equal to 1, it's not prime, so the function returns false.
2. The function then iterates from 2 to the square root of n (inclusive). 
3. For each number i in this range, it checks if n is divisible by i. 
   - If n is divisible by i (i.e., n%i == 0), it means n is not a prime number, so the function returns false.
4. If the function finishes the iteration without finding a divisor, it means n is a prime number, so the function returns true.

This algorithm is efficient because it only needs to check divisibility up to the square root of n, rather than all the way up to n. This is because a larger factor of n would be a multiple of a smaller factor that has already been checked.  This optimization reduces the time complexity of the algorithm from O(n) to O(âˆšn).  Additionally, the function starts checking from 2, which is the smallest prime number, which further reduces the time complexity. 

This function can be used to check whether a given number is prime or not. For example, IsPrime(6) would return false, while IsPrime(101) would return true.  If you want to check whether a large number is prime, this function would be efficient and accurate.  However, for very large numbers, you might want to use more advanced algorithms or libraries that can handle those cases more efficiently.  For example, the Miller-Rabin primality test is a probabilistic algorithm that can be used to test whether a large number is prime or composite, but it's more complex and requires more computational resources.  For small to medium-sized numbers, this simple algorithm should be sufficient.
