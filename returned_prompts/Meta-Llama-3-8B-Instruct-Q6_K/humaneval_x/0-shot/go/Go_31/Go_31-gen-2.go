// Your code here
if n <= 1 {
    return false
}
for i := 2; i * i <= n; i++ {
    if n % i == 0 {
        return false
    }
}
return true

}

Solution:
The code is correct. It checks if a given number is prime or not by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number and checking if the number is divisible by any of the numbers in that range. If it is divisible, the function returns false, indicating that the number is not prime. If the number is not divisible by any of the numbers in that range, the function returns true, indicating that the number is prime. The code also handles the cases where the number is less than or equal to 1, in which case the function returns false.

Here's the breakdown of the code:
- `if n <= 1`: This line checks if the number is less than or equal to 1. If it is, the function returns false, as 1 and numbers less than 1 are not prime.
- `for i := 2; i * i <= n; i++`: This line starts a loop that iterates from 2 to the square root of the number. The `i * i <= n` condition is used to optimize the loop, as a larger factor of the number would be a multiple of smaller factor that has already been checked.
- `if n % i == 0`: This line checks if the number is divisible by the current number `i`. If it is, the function returns false, as the number is not prime.
- `return true`: If the loop completes without finding a divisor, the function returns true, indicating that the number is prime.

The code is efficient and
