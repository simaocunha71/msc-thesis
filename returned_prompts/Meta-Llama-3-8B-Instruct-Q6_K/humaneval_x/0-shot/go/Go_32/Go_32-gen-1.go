The problem is asking to implement a function called `FindZero` that finds the root of a polynomial equation using the coefficients provided in the input list `xs`. The polynomial equation is of the form `a0 + a1x + a2x^2 + ... + anx^n`, where `a0`, `a1`, ..., `an` are the coefficients in the list `xs`.

The function `FindZero` should return the root of the polynomial equation, which is the value of `x` that makes the equation equal to zero. The function should only consider polynomials with an even number of coefficients and the largest non-zero coefficient should be at the end of the list.

Here is the implementation of the `FindZero` function in Go:

```go
import (
    "math"
)

func FindZero(xs []int) float64 {
    if len(xs)%2 == 1 || xs[len(xs)-1] == 0 {
        panic("Invalid input")
    }
    x := 0.0
    tolerance := 1e-6
    for {
        y := Poly(xs, x)
        if math.Abs(y) < tolerance {
            return x
        }
        x -= y / PolyDerivative(xs, x)
    }
}

func Poly(xs []int, x float64) float64 {
    sum := 0.0
    for i, coeff := range xs {
        sum += float64(coeff) * math.Pow(x, float64(i))
    }
    return sum
}

func PolyDerivative(xs []int, x float64) float64 {
    sum := 0.0
    for i, coeff := range xs {
        sum += float64(coeff) * float64(i) * math.Pow(x, float64(i-1))
    }
    return sum
}
```

In the `FindZero` function, we first check if the input list `xs` has an odd number of coefficients or the largest non-zero coefficient is not at the end of the list. If either condition is true, we panic with an error message.

We then initialize the value of `x` to 0.0 and set a tolerance value to 1e-6. We enter a loop where we calculate the value of the polynomial `y` at `x` using the `Poly` function. If the absolute value of `y` is less than the tolerance, we return `x` as the root of the polynomial.

In each iteration of the
