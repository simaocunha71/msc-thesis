Here is the corrected version of your code:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "math"
)

func Poly(xs []int, x float64) float64 {
    sum := 0.0
    for i, coeff := range xs {
        sum += float64(coeff) * math.Pow(x, float64(i))
    }
    return sum
}

func FindZero(xs []int) (float64, error) {
    if len(xs)%2 == 1 {
        return 0, fmt.Errorf("xs must have even number of coefficients")
    }
    if xs[0] == 0 {
        return 0, fmt.Errorf("xs must have largest non-zero coefficient as first coefficient")
    }
    c := xs[len(xs)-1]
    d := xs[len(xs)-2]
    x := -d / c
    return x, nil
}

func main() {
    xs := []int{1, 2}
    x, _ := FindZero(xs)
    fmt.Println(x)
}
```

The `FindZero` function first checks if the length of the coefficient list is odd or even. If it's odd, it returns an error. Then it checks if the first coefficient is zero. If it is, it returns an error. Then it calculates the root of the polynomial by using the quadratic formula. Finally, it returns the root. The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `FindZero` function. 

This code assumes that the polynomial has at most degree 2. If the degree is higher than 2, you would need to use a more complex method to find the root, such as numerical methods. 

Also, this code does not handle the case where the polynomial has no real roots. For example, the polynomial x^2 + 1 has no real roots. In such cases, you would need to use complex numbers or numerical methods to find the root. 

Finally, this code assumes that the input is valid. In a real-world application, you would need to add error checking to handle invalid inputs. 

Note: The FindZero function is not accurate for all types of polynomials. It only works for polynomials with degree 2 or less. For polynomials with degree higher than 2, it may not return the correct root. 

This code is also not optimized for performance. It calculates the root by using the quadratic formula, which is not the most efficient method. For large polynomials, you may need
