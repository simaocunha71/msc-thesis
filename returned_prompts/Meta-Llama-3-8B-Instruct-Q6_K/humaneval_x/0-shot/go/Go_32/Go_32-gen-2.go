The problem is to find the root of a polynomial, which is the value of x such that the polynomial evaluated at x is zero.

The provided function `Poly` evaluates a polynomial at a given point x. The function `FindZero` finds the root of the polynomial by iteratively improving an initial guess for the root until the polynomial evaluated at the guess is close to zero.
