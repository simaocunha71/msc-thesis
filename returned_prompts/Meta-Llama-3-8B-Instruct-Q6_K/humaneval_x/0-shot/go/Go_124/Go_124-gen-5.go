This Go program defines a function called `ValidDate` that takes a date string as input and checks if it's a valid date. The function splits the date string into three parts (month, day, year), then checks the validity of the date based on the following rules:

1. The date string is not empty.
2. The month is between 1 and 12.
3. The day is valid for the given month. For example, the day can be between 1 and 31 for months 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10,
