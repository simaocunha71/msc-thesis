```go
func ChooseNum(x, y int) int {
    if x > y {
        return -1
    }
    for ; x <= y; x++ {
        if x%2 == 0 {
            return x
        }
    }
    return -1
}
```


The provided code defines a function called `ChooseNum` that takes two positive integers `x` and `y` as input and returns the largest even integer number within the range `[x, y]` inclusive. If no such number exists, it returns `-1`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. The function first checks if `x` is greater than `y`. If this is the case, it returns `-1`, as there is no even number in the range `[x, y]`.
2. The function then enters a for loop, which continues until `x` exceeds `y`.
3. Within the loop, the code checks if `x` is even by using the modulo operator (`%`). If `x` is even (i.e., `x % 2 == 0`), the function returns `x`, as it is the largest even integer in the range.
4. If no even number is found within the range, the function returns `-1` when the loop exits, indicating that no even number exists in the range.

The provided examples illustrate the function's behavior:

* `ChooseNum(12, 15)` returns `14`, which is the largest even integer in the range `[12, 15]`.
* `ChooseNum(13, 12)` returns `-1`, as there is no even number in the range `[13, 12]`.
