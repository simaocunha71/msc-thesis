```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "strings"
)

func ReverseDelete(s, c string) [2]interface{} {
    // Create a set of characters in c for efficient lookup
    cSet := make(map[rune]bool)
    for _, ch := range c {
        cSet[rune(ch)] = true
    }

    // Delete characters in s that are equal to any character in c
    result := ""
    for _, ch := range s {
        if _, ok := cSet[rune(ch)]; !ok {
            result += string(ch)
        }
    }

    // Check if the result string is palindrome
    isPalindrome := strings.EqualFold(result, reverse(result))

    return [2]interface{}{result, isPalindrome}
}

func reverse(s string) string {
    runes := []rune(s)
    for i, j := 0, len(runes)-1; i < j; i, j = i+1, j-1 {
        runes[i], runes[j] = runes[j], runes[i]
    }
    return string(runes)
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(ReverseDelete("abcde", "ae"))  // Output: ['bcd', false]
    fmt.Println(ReverseDelete("abcdef", "b"))  // Output: ['acdef', false]
    fmt.Println(ReverseDelete("abcdedcba", "ab"))  // Output: ['cdedc', true]
}
```
This code works as follows:

1. First, it creates a set of characters in c for efficient lookup.
2. Then, it deletes characters in s that are equal to any character in c by iterating over s and checking each character against the set.
3. After that, it checks if the result string is palindrome by comparing it with its reverse.
4. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the result string and a boolean indicating whether the string is palindrome.

The reverse function is used to reverse a string. It does this by swapping the characters at the beginning and end of the string, and then moving towards the center. This way, the order of the characters is reversed.

In the main function, we test the ReverseDelete function with some examples and print the results. The output of these examples is as expected.
