Explanation:
The given problem requires to find the total sum of digits in binary of a given positive integer N. The function `Solve(N int) string` is implemented to solve this problem. 

First, it converts the number N to binary using `strconv.FormatInt(int64(N), 2)`. Then, it sums up the digits in the binary string. If a digit is '1', it increments the sum. 

Finally, it converts the sum to binary using `strconv.FormatInt(int64(sum), 2)` and returns the result as a string.

In the main function, three test cases are provided to demonstrate the functionality of the `Solve(N int) string` function. The expected output for each test case is also provided. 

When you run the program, it will print the output for each test case, which should match the expected output. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(logN) due to the conversion of the number to binary and the sum of the digits. The space complexity is O(logN) for storing the binary string. 

Note: The problem statement does not explicitly mention the output type, but based on the provided test cases, it is clear that the output should be a string of binary numbers. The function `Solve(N int) string` returns
