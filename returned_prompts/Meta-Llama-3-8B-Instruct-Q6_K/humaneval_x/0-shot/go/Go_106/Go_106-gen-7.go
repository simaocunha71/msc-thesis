Explanation:
The function F takes an integer n as input and returns a list of size n. It initializes an empty list result and then iterates over the range [0, n). For each index i, it checks if i is even. If it is, it calculates the factorial of i using the helper function factorial and assigns it to the result list at index i. If i is odd, it calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to i using a nested loop and assigns it to the result list at index i. Finally, it returns the result list.

The helper function factorial calculates the factorial of a given number n. It uses a loop to multiply the numbers from 2 to n and returns the result. If n is 0, it returns 1 as the factorial of 0 is defined to be 1. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) because it iterates over the range [0, n) and performs a constant amount of work for each iteration. The space complexity is also O(n) because it stores the result list of size n. 

Example output:
F(5) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15]
Explanation: 
F(5) returns a list of size 5. The value at index 0 is 1 (since 0 is not even and 0! = 1). The value at index 1 is 2 (since 1 is odd and the sum of numbers from 1 to 1 is 1 + 1 = 2). The value at index 2 is 6 (since 2 is even and 2! = 2). The value at index 3 is 24 (since 3 is odd and the
