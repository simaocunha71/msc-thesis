```go
func IsNested(s string) bool {
    stack := []rune{}
    for _, c := range s {
        if c == '[' {
            stack = append(stack, c)
        } else if c == ']' {
            if len(stack) == 0 {
                return false
            }
            stack = stack[:len(stack)-1]
        }
    }
    return len(stack) > 0
}
```
Explanation:
The problem is asking to create a function that checks if there is a valid subsequence of brackets in the given string where at least one bracket is nested. 

We can solve this problem by using a stack data structure. We iterate over the string, and for each character, we check if it's an opening bracket or a closing bracket. If it's an opening bracket, we push it to the stack. If it's a closing bracket, we check if the stack is empty or not. If the stack is empty, it means there's no matching opening bracket for the current closing bracket, so we return false. If the stack is not empty, we pop the opening bracket from the stack. 

At the end of the function, we check if the stack is empty or not. If it's not empty, it means there are some opening brackets that don't have matching closing brackets, so we return true. If the stack is empty, it means all brackets are matched, so we return false. 

Here is the Go code for the function:

```go
func IsNested(s string) bool {
    stack := []rune{}
    for _, c := range s {
        if c == '[' {
            stack = append(stack, c)
        } else if c == ']' {
            if len(stack) == 0 {
                return false
            }
            stack = stack[:len(stack)-1]
        }
    }
    return len(stack) > 0
}
```


This function works by iterating over the string and using a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. It returns true if there is at least one opening bracket that doesn't have a matching closing bracket, and false otherwise. The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the string, because it needs to iterate over the string once. The space complexity is O(n), because in the worst case, all characters in the string could be opening brackets.
