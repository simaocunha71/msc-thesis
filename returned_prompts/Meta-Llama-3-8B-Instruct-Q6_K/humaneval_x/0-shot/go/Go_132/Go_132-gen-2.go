The problem is asking you to create a function that takes a string of square brackets as input and returns true if and only if there is a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket in the subsequence is nested. 

The problem can be solved by using a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. If the stack is empty at any point, or if the stack is not empty when a closing bracket is encountered, then there is no valid subsequence of brackets with at least one nested bracket. 

Here is a possible solution in Go:
```go
func IsNested(s string) bool {
    stack := []rune{}
    for _, r := range s {
        if r == '[' {
            stack = append(stack, r)
        } else if r == ']' {
            if len(stack) == 0 {
                return false
            }
            stack = stack[:len(stack)-1]
        }
    }
    return len(stack) > 0
}
```
This function iterates over the input string, pushing each opening bracket onto the stack and popping each closing bracket off the stack. If the stack is empty at any point or if the stack is not empty when a closing bracket is encountered, then the function returns false. If the function has not returned false by the time it has iterated over the entire string, then it returns true if the stack is not empty (indicating that there is at least one nested bracket) and false otherwise. 

For example, the input string '[[]]' would cause the function to push two opening brackets onto the stack, then pop two closing brackets off the stack, leaving the stack empty. The function would then return false. The input string '[[][]]' would cause the function to push three opening brackets onto the stack, then pop three closing brackets off the stack, leaving the stack empty. The function would then return false. The input string '[[]][[' would cause the function to push two opening brackets onto the stack, then pop two closing brackets off the stack, then push one opening bracket onto the stack and return true. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string, and a space complexity of O(n), where n is the maximum number of opening brackets in the input string. 

Note: The problem statement seems to be missing some information. The problem statement should specify what constitutes a "valid subsequence of brackets" and what constitutes a "nested bracket". Based on the examples provided, it
