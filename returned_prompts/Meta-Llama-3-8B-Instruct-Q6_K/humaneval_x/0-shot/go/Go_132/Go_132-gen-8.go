The problem is asking to create a function that takes a string of square brackets as input and returns true if there is a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket in the subsequence is nested. A nested bracket is a bracket that is inside another bracket. For example, in the string '[[]]', the '[' is inside the '[' which is inside the ']', so the string has a nested bracket.

Here's a solution in Go:

```go
func IsNested(s string) bool {
    stack := []rune{}
    for _, c := range s {
        if c == '[' {
            stack = append(stack, c)
        } else if c == ']' {
            if len(stack) == 0 {
                return false
            }
            stack = stack[:len(stack)-1]
        }
    }
    return len(stack) > 0
}
```

This function uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. It iterates over the input string, and for each character, it checks if it's an opening bracket or a closing bracket. If it's an opening bracket, it pushes it onto the stack. If it's a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means there's no matching opening bracket, so it returns false. If the stack is not empty, it pops the opening bracket from the stack. After iterating over the entire string, it checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is not empty, it means there are unmatched opening brackets, so it returns true. If the stack is empty, it means all brackets are matched, so it returns false.
