```go
func IsNested(s string) bool {
    count := 0
    for _, ch := range s {
        if ch == '[' {
            count++
        } else if ch == ']' {
            if count == 0 {
                return false
            }
            count--
        }
    }
    return count > 0
}
```
The function IsNested(s string) checks if there is a valid subsequence of brackets in the input string s. It iterates over the string and keeps track of the count of opening brackets ( '[' ) and closing brackets ( ']' ). If the count of opening brackets is greater than the count of closing brackets at any point, it means that there is a nested bracket, so it returns true. If it finishes iterating over the string and the count of opening brackets is greater than zero, it means that there are unbalanced opening brackets, so it also returns true. If it finishes iterating over the string and the count of opening brackets is zero, it means that all brackets are balanced, so it returns false. If it encounters a closing bracket when the count of opening brackets is zero, it means that there is no matching opening bracket for the closing bracket, so it also returns false. The function returns true if and only if there is a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket in the subsequence is nested.
