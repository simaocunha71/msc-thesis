```go
func IsNested(s string) bool {
    count := 0
    for _, v := range s {
        if v == '[' {
            count++
        } else if v == ']' {
            if count == 0 {
                return false
            }
            count--
        }
    }
    return count > 0
}
```
Explanation:
The function `IsNested` takes a string `s` as input, which contains only square brackets. It iterates over the string and keeps track of the count of open brackets (`'['`) and closed brackets (`']'`) using a variable `count`. When it encounters an open bracket, it increments the count. When it encounters a closed bracket, it decrements the count. If the count becomes zero at any point, it means that there are no more open brackets left to match the closed bracket, so it returns `false`. After iterating over the entire string, if the count is greater than zero, it means that there are still open brackets left unmatched, so it returns `true`. If the count is zero, it means that all brackets are matched, so it returns `false`. This function returns `true` if and only if there is a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket in the subsequence is nested.
