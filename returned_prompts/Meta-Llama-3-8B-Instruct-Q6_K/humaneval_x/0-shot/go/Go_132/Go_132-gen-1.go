```
func IsNested(s string) bool {
    count := 0
    for _, c := range s {
        if c == '[' {
            count++
        } else if c == ']' {
            if count == 0 {
                return false
            }
            count--
        }
    }
    return count > 0
}
```


I hope you are looking for a solution in Go. If that's the case, the given code should work correctly. The function `IsNested` iterates over the input string `s` and keeps track of the number of open brackets (`'['`) encountered so far using the `count` variable. When a close bracket (`']'`) is encountered, it checks if the `count` is zero. If it is, it means there are no open brackets to match this close bracket, so the function returns `false`. If `count` is greater than zero, it decrements `count` to account for the matched open bracket. After iterating over the entire string, the function returns `true` if there are any remaining open brackets (i.e., `count > 0`), indicating the presence of a nested subsequence, and `false` otherwise.
