The problem is asking to separate the groups of nested parentheses in a given string and return them as a list. The groups are balanced and not nested within each other. The string can contain spaces, which should be ignored.

Here is a Python solution using a stack:

```python
def SeparateParenGroups(paren_string):
    stack = []
    result = []
    temp = ''

    for char in paren_string:
        if char == ' ':
            continue
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(char)
            temp += char
        elif char == ')':
            if stack:
                stack.pop()
                temp += char
                if not stack:
                    result.append(temp)
                    temp = ''
            else:
                return []  # invalid parentheses

    if stack:
        return []  # unbalanced parentheses

    return result
```

This function iterates over the input string. When it encounters an open parenthesis, it pushes it onto the stack and adds it to the temporary string. When it encounters a close parenthesis, it pops the stack and adds it to the temporary string. If the stack is empty when it encounters a close parenthesis, it means there's an unbalanced parentheses, so it returns an empty list. When it encounters a space, it simply ignores it.

After iterating over the entire string, if there's any remaining characters in the stack, it means there's an unbalanced parentheses, so it returns an empty list.

Finally, it returns the list of separated groups of parentheses.
