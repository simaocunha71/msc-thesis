Explanation:
The function `SumSquares` takes a slice of integers as input and returns the sum of the modified elements.

The function iterates over the slice using a `for` loop with a range, which allows us to access both the index `i` and the value `v` of each element.

We use the modulo operator `%` to check if the index `i` is a multiple of 3 or 4. If it is, we apply the corresponding mathematical operation (squaring or cubing) to the value `v` and add the result to the sum.

If the index `i` is not a multiple of 3 or 4, we simply add the original value `v` to the sum.

Finally, we return the sum as an integer.

The `math.Pow` function is used to compute the power of a number. In this case, we use it to square or cube the values. The `float64` conversion is necessary because `math.Pow` expects a floating-point number as its first argument. The result is then converted back to an integer using the `int` function.

The examples you provided demonstrate the expected behavior of the function:
```go
SumSquares([]int{1, 2, 3}) // returns 6
SumSquares([]int{}) // returns 0
SumSquares([]int{-1, -5, 2, -1, -5}) // returns -126
