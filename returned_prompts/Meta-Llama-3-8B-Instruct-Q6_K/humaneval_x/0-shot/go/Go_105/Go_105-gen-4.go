R:
The provided function checks if the last character of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word.

Here's the breakdown of the function:

1.  It first checks if the string is empty. If it is, the function returns `false`.
2.  Then, it checks if the last character of the string is an alphabetical character using the `isalpha` function.
3.  If the last character is an alphabetical character, it checks if the last character is part of a word by checking if the character before it is also an alphabetical character. This is done using the condition `!isalpha(txt.back()-1)`.
4.  If the last character is not part of a word, the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

The main function demonstrates the usage of the `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` function with the string "apple pi e". The output will be `1`, indicating that the last character 'e' is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word.
