Answer: This is a function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.

The function takes an integer n as input and returns the nth Fibonacci number. The function uses a loop to calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth number and returns the nth number.

The main function calls the Fib function with different inputs (10, 1, 8) and prints the results.

Here is the code:
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func Fib(n int) int {
    if n <= 1 {
        return n
    }
    a, b := 1, 1
    for i := 2; i <= n; i++ {
        a, b = b, a+b
    }
    return b
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(Fib(10))  // prints 55
    fmt.Println(Fib(1))   // prints 1
    fmt.Println(Fib(8))   // prints 21
}
```
Output:
```
55
1
21
```  Answer 2:

The code is a simple implementation of the Fibonacci sequence in Go. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where a number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.

The `Fib` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the `n`th Fibonacci number. The function uses a loop to calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to the `n`th number and returns the `n`th number.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. `if n <= 1 { return n }`: This line checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1. If it is, the function returns `n` directly, because the Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1.
2. `a, b := 1,
