Which one is the most efficient solution?

The most efficient solution is option D. This is because it uses matrix exponentiation to compute the nth Fibonacci number in O(log n) time complexity. It uses a matrix that represents the Fibonacci recurrence relation, and then raises this matrix to the power of n using exponentiation by squaring. This approach has a time complexity of O(log n), which is much faster than the other options.

Here is a brief explanation of each option:

A: This is the naive recursive solution, which has a time complexity of O(2^n) due to the repeated computation of the same Fibonacci numbers.

B: This is a iterative solution that uses a loop to compute the Fibonacci numbers. It has a time complexity of O(n), which is faster than the recursive solution but still not efficient for large values of n.

C: This is another iterative solution that uses an array to store the Fibonacci numbers. It has a time complexity of O(n), which is the same as option B.

D: This is the most efficient solution that uses matrix exponentiation to compute the nth Fibonacci number. It has a time complexity of O(log n), which is much faster than the other options.

It's worth noting that the other options are not efficient for large values of n, while option D is suitable for very large
