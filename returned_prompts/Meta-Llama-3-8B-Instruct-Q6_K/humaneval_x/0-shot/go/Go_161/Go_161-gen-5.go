This solution is using two pointers, one at the beginning and one at the end of the byte slice. It checks each character at the pointers and reverses its case if it's a letter. It then moves the pointers towards the center. If the string contains no letters, it reverses the string. Finally, it converts the byte slice back to a string and returns it. The function works by iterating over the string and reversing the case of each letter. If the string contains no letters, it reverses the string. The time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the string. The space complexity is O(1) as it uses a constant amount of space. This is a good solution for this problem as it is efficient and easy
