The problem is asking to find the nth number that is both a Fibonacci number and a prime number. Here is a Python solution for this problem:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        a, b = 0, 1
        for _ in range(2, n):
            a, b = b, a + b
        return b

def PrimeFib(n):
    i = 1
    while True:
        fib = fibonacci(i)
        if is_prime(fib):
            if i == n:
                return fib
            i += 1
```

This solution first checks if a number is prime using the `is_prime` function. Then it calculates the nth Fibonacci number using the `fibonacci` function. Finally, it checks if the Fibonacci number is prime and returns it if it is the nth Fibonacci number. If not, it increments the index and repeats the process. This solution is not efficient for large values of n, as it checks all numbers up to n. A more efficient solution would be to use a sieve to generate all prime numbers up to n and then check if the Fibonacci numbers are in this list.
