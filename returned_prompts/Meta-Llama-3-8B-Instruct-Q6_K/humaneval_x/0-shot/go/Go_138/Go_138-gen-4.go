```go
func IsEqualToSumEven(n int) bool {
    for a := 2; a <= n; a += 2 {
        for b := 2; b <= n-a; b += 2 {
            for c := 2; c <= n-a-b; c += 2 {
                d := n - a - b - c
                if d > 0 && d%2 == 0 {
                    return true
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return false
}
```


The problem is asking to check if a given number `n` can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. The function `IsEqualToSumEven(n int) bool` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a boolean indicating whether `n` can be written as the sum of 4 positive even numbers.

The function uses four nested loops to generate all possible combinations of four positive even numbers that sum up to `n`. The loops iterate over the range from 2 to `n` with a step of 2, which ensures that only even numbers are considered.

For each combination, the function calculates the sum of the four numbers and checks if it equals `n`. If the sum equals `n`, the function returns `true`. If no combination is found that sums up to `n`, the function returns `false`.

The time complexity of this function is O(n^3), which can be improved by using a more efficient algorithm or data structure. However, for small values of `n`, this function should be sufficient.
