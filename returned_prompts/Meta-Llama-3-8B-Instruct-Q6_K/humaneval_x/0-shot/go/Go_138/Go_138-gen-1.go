Explanation:
The function `IsEqualToSumEven` checks whether the given number `n` can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. It does this by iterating through all possible pairs of even numbers and checking if their sum is equal to `n`. If it finds a pair that sums up to `n`, it returns `true`. If it doesn't find any such pair, it returns `false`.

The function starts by initializing a variable `sum` to 0. It then enters a nested loop, where the outer loop iterates through all even numbers from 2 to `n`, and the inner loop iterates through all even numbers from 2 to `n/2`. For each pair of even numbers `i` and `j`, it checks if their sum `sum` is less than or equal to `n`. If it is, it checks if `sum` is equal to `n`. If it is, it returns `true`. If it doesn't find any such pair, it returns `false`.

In the example, `IsEqualToSumEven(4)` returns `false` because 4 cannot be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. `IsEqualToSumEven(6)` returns `false` because 6 cannot be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. `IsEqualToSumEven(8)` returns `true` because 8 can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers: 2+2+2+2.
