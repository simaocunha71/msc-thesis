Explanation:

The problem is asking to check if a given number `n` can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. The function `IsEqualToSumEven(n int)` returns a boolean value indicating whether `n` can be written as the sum of 4 even numbers.

The solution is implemented using a brute force approach. It iterates over all possible combinations of 4 even numbers and checks if their sum equals `n`. If such a combination is found, the function returns `true`. If no such combination is found after checking all possibilities, the function returns `false`.

In the `main` function, we test the `IsEqualToSumEven` function with the examples provided in the problem statement and print the results. The output is:

```
false
false
true
```

This indicates that the function correctly identifies the numbers that can be written as the sum of 4 positive even numbers. However, please note that this solution has a time complexity of O(n^4), which may not be efficient for large values of `n`. For larger values, a more efficient algorithm or approximation may be needed.
