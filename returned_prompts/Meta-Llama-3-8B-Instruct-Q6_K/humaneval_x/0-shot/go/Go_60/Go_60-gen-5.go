func SumToN(n int) int {
    sum := 0
    for i := 1; i <= n; i++ {
        sum += i
    }
    return sum
}
B:
// This is not a valid answer.
C:
// This is not a valid answer.
D:
// This is not a valid answer.

Explanation:

The SumToN function should sum numbers from 1 to n. The correct implementation is to use a for loop to iterate from 1 to n and add each number to a running total. The final sum is returned.

The other options are not valid solutions to the problem. Option B is not a valid function definition, Option C is not a valid function definition, and Option D is not a valid function definition.
