Here is a simple solution that checks if any two numbers in the list are closer than the given threshold:

```go
import (
    "math"
)

func HasCloseElements(numbers []float64, threshold float64) bool {
    for i := 0; i < len(numbers); i++ {
        for j := i + 1; j < len(numbers); j++ {
            if math.Abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold {
                return true
            }
        }
    }
    return false
}
```

This function iterates over the list of numbers, comparing each number with every other number. If it finds two numbers that are closer than the threshold, it returns `true`. If it doesn't find any such pair, it returns `false`.

Please note that this function has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the input list. If the list is very large, this function could be slow. If performance is a concern, you could consider using a more efficient algorithm, such as sorting the list and then checking for adjacent elements that are closer than the threshold. However, this would require additional memory to store the sorted list. 

Here is the version that uses sorting:

```go
func HasCloseElements(numbers []float64, threshold float64) bool {
    sort.Float64s(numbers)
    for i := 1; i < len(numbers); i++ {
        if numbers[i] - numbers[i-1] < threshold {
            return true
        }
    }
    return false
}
```

This function sorts the list of numbers, then iterates over the sorted list, checking if any adjacent elements are closer than the threshold. If it finds such a pair, it returns `true`. If it doesn't find any such pair, it returns `false`. 

This version has a time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the length of the input list, because of the sorting step. This could be faster than the original version for large lists, but it uses more memory to store the sorted list. 

You can choose the version that best fits your needs, depending on the size of your lists and the importance of performance and memory usage.
