Here is a simple and efficient solution in Go:

```go
import (
    "math"
)

func HasCloseElements(numbers []float64, threshold float64) bool {
    for i := 0; i < len(numbers); i++ {
        for j := i + 1; j < len(numbers); j++ {
            if math.Abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold {
                return true
            }
        }
    }
    return false
}
```

This function iterates over each pair of elements in the input slice `numbers`. For each pair, it checks if the absolute difference between the two elements is less than the given `threshold`. If it finds such a pair, it immediately returns `true`. If it doesn't find any such pair after checking all pairs, it returns `false`.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the input slice, because it needs to check all pairs of elements. This might not be efficient for large input slices, but it should be fine for most practical use cases.

Also, note that this solution assumes that the input slice `numbers` contains at least one element. If the input slice could potentially be empty, you might want to add a simple check for this at the beginning of the function. For example:

```go
func HasCloseElements(numbers []float64, threshold float64) bool {
    if len(numbers) < 2 {
        return false
    }
    // ... rest of the function remains the same
}
```
