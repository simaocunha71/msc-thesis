Here is a simple and efficient solution in Go:

```go
import (
    "math"
)

func HasCloseElements(numbers []float64, threshold float64) bool {
    for i := 0; i < len(numbers); i++ {
        for j := i + 1; j < len(numbers); j++ {
            if math.Abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold {
                return true
            }
        }
    }
    return false
}
```

This function iterates over each pair of numbers in the list, and checks if the absolute difference between the two numbers is less than the given threshold. If it finds such a pair, it immediately returns `true`. If it checks all pairs without finding any that are closer than the threshold, it returns `false`. 

The time complexity of this function is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input list, because it checks each pair of numbers. However, for small to moderate-sized lists, this should be fast enough. If you need a more efficient solution, you could sort the list first and then iterate over it to find pairs that are closer than the threshold, which would have a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting. 

Here is an example of how you could implement that:

```go
func HasCloseElements(numbers []float64, threshold float64) bool {
    sort.Float64s(numbers)
    for i := 1; i < len(numbers); i++ {
        if numbers[i] - numbers[i-1] < threshold {
            return true
        }
    }
    return false
}
``` 

This function first sorts the list of numbers, and then iterates over the sorted list. It checks each pair of adjacent numbers to see if the difference between them is less than the threshold. If it finds such a pair, it returns `true`. If it checks all pairs without finding any that are closer than the threshold, it returns `false`. 

This function has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting, which is faster than the O(n^2) time complexity of the original function for large lists. However, for small lists, the original function may be faster. 

You can choose the implementation that is most suitable for your needs, based on the size of your lists and your performance requirements. 

For example, if you have a very large list and you need to check many lists for close elements, you may want to use the more efficient O
