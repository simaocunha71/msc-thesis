Here is a simple and efficient solution in Go. This function iterates over the list of numbers and checks if the difference between any two numbers is less than the given threshold.

```go
import (
    "math"
)

func HasCloseElements(numbers []float64, threshold float64) bool {
    for i := 0; i < len(numbers); i++ {
        for j := i + 1; j < len(numbers); j++ {
            if math.Abs(numbers[i]-numbers[j]) < threshold {
                return true
            }
        }
    }
    return false
}
```

This function has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the input list of numbers. This is because it checks every pair of numbers in the list. If the list is very large, this function could be slow. However, for most practical purposes, this function should be fine.

Note that this function uses the math.Abs function to calculate the absolute difference between two numbers. This is because the difference between two numbers could be negative, and we want to check if the absolute difference is less than the threshold. 

Also, this function returns as soon as it finds two numbers that are closer than the threshold, so it could return false even if there are more numbers that are closer than the threshold. If you want to check all pairs of numbers, you could modify the function to return the number of pairs that are closer than the threshold, instead of a boolean value. 

Here is an example of how you could modify the function to return the number of pairs:

```go
func CountCloseElements(numbers []float64, threshold float64) int {
    count := 0
    for i := 0; i < len(numbers); i++ {
        for j := i + 1; j < len(numbers); j++ {
            if math.Abs(numbers[i]-numbers[j]) < threshold {
                count++
            }
        }
    }
    return count
}
```
