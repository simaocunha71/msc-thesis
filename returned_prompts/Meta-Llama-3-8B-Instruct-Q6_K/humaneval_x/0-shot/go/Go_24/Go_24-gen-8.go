The function `LargestDivisor` takes an integer `n` as an argument and returns the largest integer that divides `n` evenly, smaller than `n`.

The function works by iterating from `n-1` down to `1` and checking each number to see if it divides `n` evenly. The first number that divides `n` evenly is returned as the result.

In the `main` function, we test the `LargestDivisor` function with the input `15` and print the result, which is `5`.

Here is the code:
```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

// For a given number n, find the largest number that divides n evenly, smaller than n
func LargestDivisor(n int) int {
    var divisor int
    for i := n - 1; i > 0; i-- {
        if n%i == 0 {
            divisor = i
            break
        }
    }
    return divisor
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(LargestDivisor(15))
    // Output: 5
}
```
Output:
```
5
```
Explanation:

The function `LargestDivisor` iterates from `n-1` down to `1` and checks each number to see if it divides `n` evenly. The first number that divides `n` evenly is returned as the result.

In the `main` function, we test the `LargestDivisor` function with the input `15`. The function iterates from `14` down to `1` and finds that `5` is the largest number that divides `15` evenly, smaller than `15`. Therefore, the function returns `5`. The `fmt.Println` statement prints the result, which is `5`.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the input number, because it iterates from `n-1` down to `1`. The space complexity is O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the result. A more efficient solution would be to iterate from `n
