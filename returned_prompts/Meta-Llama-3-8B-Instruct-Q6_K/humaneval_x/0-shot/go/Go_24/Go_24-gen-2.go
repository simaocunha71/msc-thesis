    // Start with i = 1, and increment until we find the largest divisor
    for i := 1; i < n; i++ {
        if n%i == 0 {
            return i
        }
    }
    // If no divisors are found, return 1 (since 1 divides any number evenly)
    return 1
}

Answer:

The function `LargestDivisor` finds the largest number that divides `n` evenly, smaller than `n`. 

The function starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` until it finds the largest divisor of `n` that is less than `n`. 

If `n` is not divisible by `i`, the function moves on to the next value of `i`. 

If no divisors are found, the function returns `1` as `1` divides any number evenly.

Here is the corrected code:

```go
func LargestDivisor(n int) int {
    for i := n; i > 1; i-- {
        if n%i == 0 {
            return i
        }
    }
    return 1
}
```

This function starts from `n` and decrements until it finds the largest divisor of `n` that is less than `n`. If no divisors are found, it returns `1`. 

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where `n` is the input number. This is because in the worst case, the function has to iterate from `n` down to `1`. The space complexity is O(1), as the function only uses a constant amount of space to store the variables `i` and `n`.
