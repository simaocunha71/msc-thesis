The problem is asking to find the largest divisor of a given number `n`, which is less than `n`. 

Here is the solution:

```go
func LargestDivisor(n int) int {
    for i := n / 2; i > 1; i-- {
        if n % i == 0 {
            return i
        }
    }
    return 1
}
```

In this solution, we start from `n/2` and decrement until we find a divisor. This is because any divisor greater than `n/2` will have a corresponding divisor smaller than `n/2`. If we don't find any divisor, we return 1. 

The time complexity of this solution is O(sqrt(n)) because we are iterating from `n/2` to 1. The space complexity is O(1) because we are using a constant amount of space. 

This solution is more efficient than the original solution provided because it starts from `n/2` instead of 3, and it decrements instead of increments. This reduces the number of iterations required to find the largest divisor. 

Also, the original solution had a bug where it was returning 2 for even numbers, which is not correct. A correct solution should return the largest divisor, not 2. 

The unit test `>>> LargestDivisor(15)` should return 5, not 2. The correct output is 5 because 5 is the largest divisor of 15 that is less than 15. 

The function `LargestDivisor` should be corrected to return the largest divisor, not 2. Here is the corrected function:

```go
func LargestDivisor(n int) int {
    for i := n / 2; i > 1; i-- {
        if n % i == 0 {
            return i
        }
    }
    return 1
}
