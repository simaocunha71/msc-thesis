Explanation:
The problem is asking to find the largest integer that appears at least as many times as its value in the given list. If no such integer exists, return -1.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. First, sort the given list in ascending order. This is because we need to iterate over the list from the end to the beginning, and we can't do this efficiently if the list is not sorted.

2. Create a map to store the frequency of each integer in the list.

3. Iterate over the list from the end to the beginning. For each integer, check if its frequency is greater than or equal to its value. If it is, return this integer.

4. If no such integer is found, return -1.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the length of the list. The space complexity is O(n) for the map. This solution is efficient for small to medium-sized lists. For very large lists, a more efficient solution might be needed.
