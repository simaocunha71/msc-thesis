Explanation:

The problem asks to find the greatest integer greater than 0 that appears at least as many times as its value in the given list of integers. If no such integer exists, return -1.

Here's a solution in Go:

1. First, we sort the list of integers in ascending order using the `sort.Ints` function from the `sort` package.
2. Then, we create a map `count` to count the frequency of each integer in the list. We iterate over the sorted list and update the count for each integer.
3. We iterate over the sorted list in reverse order (from the last element to the first) and check if the count of the current integer is greater than or equal to its value plus 1. If it is, we return the current integer as the answer.
4. If no such integer is found, we return -1.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting, where n is the length of the input list. The space complexity is O(n) for the count map.
