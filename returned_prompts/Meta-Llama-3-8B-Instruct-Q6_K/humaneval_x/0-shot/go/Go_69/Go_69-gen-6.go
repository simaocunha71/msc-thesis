Here is a Go function named `Search` that takes a slice of integers as input and returns the greatest integer that is greater than zero and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself. If no such value exists, it returns -1.

```go
func Search(lst []int) int {
    max := 0
    for _, v := range lst {
        if v > max && frequency(v, lst) >= v {
            max = v
        }
    }
    if max == 0 {
        return -1
    }
    return max
}

func frequency(x int, lst []int) int {
    count := 0
    for _, v := range lst {
        if v == x {
            count++
        }
    }
    return count
}
```

In the `Search` function, we iterate over the input list and for each integer, we check if it is greater than the current maximum and if its frequency is greater than or equal to the integer itself. If both conditions are true, we update the maximum.

The `frequency` function calculates the frequency of a given integer in the list by iterating over the list and counting the occurrences of the integer.

If the maximum value is still 0 after iterating over the list, we return -1, indicating that no such value exists. Otherwise, we return the maximum value.
