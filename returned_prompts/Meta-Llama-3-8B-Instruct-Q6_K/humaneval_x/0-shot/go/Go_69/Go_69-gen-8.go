Explanation:

This problem requires us to find the greatest integer in a list that appears at least as many times as its value. The function `Search` takes a list of integers as input and returns the greatest such integer. If no such integer exists, it returns -1.

The function `count` is a helper function that counts the frequency of a given integer in the list.

In the `Search` function, we iterate over each integer in the list. If the integer is positive and greater than the current maximum, we check if its frequency is at least equal to its value. If it is, we update the maximum.

Finally, if the maximum is still 0, it means no such integer was found, so we return -1. Otherwise, we return the maximum.
