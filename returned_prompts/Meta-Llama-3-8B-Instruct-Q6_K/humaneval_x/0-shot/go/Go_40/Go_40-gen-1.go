```
    for i := 0; i < len(l); i++ {
        for j := i + 1; j < len(l); j++ {
            for k := j + 1; k < len(l); k++ {
                if l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0 {
                    return true
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return false
}
```


This solution is simple and effective, but it has a time complexity of O(n^3), where n is the number of elements in the list. This is because for each element in the list, it checks all the other elements to see if they sum to zero.

To improve the time complexity, we can use a hash map to store the elements we have seen so far, and then for each new element, check if its negative exists in the hash map. This will reduce the time complexity to O(n^2).

Here is the improved solution:

```go
func TriplesSumToZero(l []int) bool {
    m := make(map[int]bool)
    for _, v := range l {
        if _, ok := m[-v]; ok {
            return true
        }
        m[v] = true
    }
    return false
}
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), which is much more efficient than the original solution. It is also more concise and easier to read. However, it still has a space complexity of O(n), because it needs to store all the elements in the hash map. If the list is very large, this could be a problem. In that case, we could use a more advanced data structure, such as a balanced binary search tree, to store the elements. This would allow us to reduce the space complexity to O(log n), but it would also increase the time complexity to O(n log n).
