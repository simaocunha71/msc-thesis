```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func SumProduct(numbers []int) [2]int {
	sum := 0
	product := 1
	for _, num := range numbers {
		sum += num
		product *= num
	}
	if len(numbers) == 0 {
		return [2]int{0, 1}
	}
	return [2]int{sum, product}
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(SumProduct([]int{}))  // (0, 1)
	fmt.Println(SumProduct([]int{1, 2, 3, 4}))  // (10, 24)
}
```

Explanation:
The problem is asking to create a function that takes a list of integers as input and returns a tuple containing the sum and product of all the integers in the list. If the list is empty, the sum should be 0 and the product should be 1.

In the given Go code, we define a function `SumProduct` that takes a slice of integers as input. We initialize two variables `sum` and `product` to 0 and 1 respectively. We then iterate over the input slice using a for loop and add each number to `sum` and multiply each number with `product`.

If the input slice is empty, we return a tuple containing 0 and 1. Otherwise, we return a tuple containing the calculated `sum` and `product`.

In the `main` function, we test the `SumProduct` function with an empty slice and a non-empty slice, and print the results. The output is as expected: `(0, 1)` for an empty slice and `(10, 24)` for a non-empty slice.
