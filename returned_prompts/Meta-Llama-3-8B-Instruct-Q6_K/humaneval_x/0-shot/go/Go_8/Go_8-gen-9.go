Explanation:
The function `SumProduct` takes a slice of integers as input and returns a tuple (or a slice of two integers) consisting of the sum and product of all the integers in the slice. If the slice is empty, it returns the tuple `(0, 1)`, which is the sum and product of an empty set of numbers, respectively. The sum of an empty set is 0 and the product of an empty set is 1.

In the code, we initialize two variables `sum` and `product` to 0 and 1, respectively. Then, we iterate over the slice of numbers, adding each number to `sum` and multiplying each number with `product`. After the loop, we check if the slice is empty. If it is, we reset `sum` to 0 and `product` to 1. Finally, we return a slice containing `sum` and `product`. In the `main` function, we test the `SumProduct` function with an empty slice and a slice with some numbers. The output is `(0, 1)` for the empty slice and `(10, 24)` for the slice `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
