Explanation:
The `IsBored` function takes a string `S` as input and returns the number of boredoms. A boredom is a sentence that starts with the word "I". 

First, we use the `regexp` package to find all the sentences in the input string `S`. We use the regular expression `[.!?]` to match the end of each sentence (a dot, question mark, or exclamation mark).

Then, we iterate over the sentences and check if each sentence starts with "I" (ignoring leading and trailing whitespaces). If a sentence starts with "I", we increment the `boredoms` counter.

Finally, we return the `boredoms` counter.

In the `main` function, we test the `IsBored` function with two examples and print the results. The first example has no boredoms, and the second example has one boredom.  The output of the program will be:
```
0
1
```  Go lang program that counts the number of boredoms in a given string. A boredom is a sentence that starts with the word "I". Sentences are delimited by '.', '?' or '!'.  The program uses regular expressions to find all the sentences in the input string and then checks each sentence to see if it starts with the word "I". If it does, it increments a counter. The function returns the number of boredoms found.  The program also includes a main function that tests the IsBored function with two examples and prints the results.  The output of the program will be:
