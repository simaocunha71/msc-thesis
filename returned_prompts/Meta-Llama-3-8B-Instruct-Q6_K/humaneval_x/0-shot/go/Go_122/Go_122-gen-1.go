```go
func AddElements(arr []int, k int) int {
    var sum int
    for i := 0; i < k; i++ {
        if len(strconv.Itoa(arr[i])) <= 2 {
            sum += arr[i]
        }
    }
    return sum
}
```

The function AddElements takes an array of integers and an integer k as input. It initializes a variable sum to 0, then iterates over the first k elements of the array. For each element, it converts the element to a string and checks if the length of the string is less than or equal to 2. If it is, it adds the element to the sum. Finally, it returns the sum.

For example, if arr = [111,21,3,4000,5,6,7,8,9] and k = 4, the function will iterate over the first 4 elements of the array, which are 111, 21, 3, and 4000. The length of the string representation of 111, 21, and 3 are all greater than 2, so they will not be added to the sum. The length of the string representation of 4000 is greater than 2, so it will not be added to the sum. The sum will be 21 + 3 = 24. The function will return 24.
