Here is the solution in Go:

```go
package main

import (
    "math"
    "strconv"
    "strings"
)

func ClosestInteger(value string) int {
    num, _ := strconv.ParseFloat(value, 64)
    if math.Abs(float64(int(num))) <= math.Abs(float64(num-int(num))) {
        return int(num)
    } else {
        return int(math.Ceil(float64(num)))
    }
}

func main() {
    println(ClosestInteger("10"))  // Output: 10
    println(ClosestInteger("15.3")) // Output: 15
}
```

This code first parses the given string into a float64. Then it checks if the absolute difference between the float64 and the nearest integer is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the float64 and the next integer. If this condition is true, it returns the integer. Otherwise, it returns the integer that is the next largest. This is the "round away from zero" behavior specified in the problem. The main function is used to test the ClosestInteger function with the given examples.  The println function is used to print the output.  The "math" package is used for mathematical operations and the "strconv" package is used for converting between strings and numbers. The "strings" package is not used in this code.  The "println" function is used to print the output to the console.  The "main" function is the entry point of the program.  The "println" function is used to print the output to the console.
