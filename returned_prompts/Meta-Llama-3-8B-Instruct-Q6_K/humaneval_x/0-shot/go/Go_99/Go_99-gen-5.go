Here is the solution to the problem:

```go
import (
    "math"
    "strconv"
    "strings"
)

func ClosestInteger(value string) int {
    num, err := strconv.ParseFloat(value, 64)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    if math.Abs(num - int64(num)) < 0.5 {
        return int(num + 0.5)
    } else {
        return int(math.Ceil(float64(num)))
    }
}
```

This function first converts the input string to a float64 using `strconv.ParseFloat`. It then checks if the difference between the float64 and its integer part is less than 0.5. If it is, it returns the integer part plus 0.5, which rounds the number away from zero. If the difference is not less than 0.5, it returns the ceiling of the number, which is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the number. The `math.Ceil` function is used to calculate the ceiling. The `int64` conversion is used to avoid precision loss when converting the float64 to an integer. The `int` function is used to convert the result to an integer. The `panic` function is used to handle any errors that may occur during the conversion. The `math.Abs` function is used to calculate the absolute value of the difference. The `math.Ceil` function is used to calculate the ceiling of the number. The `float64` conversion is used to avoid precision loss when converting the float64 to an integer. The `int` function is used to convert the result to an integer.
