Explanation:
The function `Exchange` takes two lists of numbers, `lst1` and `lst2`, as input and returns a string indicating whether it is possible to make `lst1` a list of only even numbers by exchanging elements with `lst2`.

The function first counts the number of odd numbers in `lst1` using a loop. Then, it subtracts the number of odd numbers in `lst2` from the count of odd numbers in `lst1`. If the result is 0, it means that the number of odd numbers in `lst1` can be made equal to 0 by exchanging elements with `lst2`, so the function returns "YES". Otherwise, it returns "NO".

The time complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the length of the input lists, because it needs to iterate over the elements of the lists once. The space complexity is O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the count of odd numbers.
