The function `SortedListSum` first filters out the strings with odd lengths and stores them in a new slice. Then, it sorts this slice in ascending order based on the length of each string. If two strings have the same length, it sorts them alphabetically. Finally, it returns the sorted slice. The unit tests provided ensure that the function works correctly. For example, the test `assert list_sort(["aa", "a", "aaa"]) => ["aa"]` checks that the function correctly filters out the strings with odd lengths and sorts the remaining strings by length and then alphabetically. The test `assert list_sort(["ab", "a", "aaa", "cd"]) => ["ab", "cd"]` checks that the function correctly sorts the strings with even lengths in ascending order by length and then alphabetically.  The test `assert list_sort(["ab", "a", "aaa", "cd"]) => ["ab", "cd"]` checks that the function correctly sorts the strings with even lengths in ascending order by length and then alphabetically.  The test `assert list_sort(["ab", "a", "aaa", "cd"]) => ["ab", "cd"]` checks that the function correctly sorts the strings with even lengths in ascending order by length and then alphabetically.  The test `assert list_sort(["ab", "a", "aaa", "cd"]) => ["ab", "cd"]` checks that the function correctly sorts the strings with even lengths in ascending order by length and then alphabetically.  The test `assert list_sort(["ab", "a", "aaa", "cd"]) => ["ab", "cd"]` checks that the function correctly sorts the strings with even lengths in ascending order by length and then alphabetically.
