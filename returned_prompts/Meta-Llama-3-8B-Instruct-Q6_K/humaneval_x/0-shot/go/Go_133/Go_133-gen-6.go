Explanation:
The problem asks to find the sum of squared numbers in the given list, but first, each number in the list should be rounded to the upper integer using the Ceiling function. 

We use the `math` package to calculate the ceiling of each number in the list and the `math/cmath` package for the `Ceil` function.

In the `SumSquares` function, we iterate over each number in the list, calculate its ceiling, square the ceiling, and add it to the sum. Finally, we return the sum.

Note: The `math.Pow` function is used to calculate the square of a number. The `float64` type is used as the type of the arguments to `math.Pow` to ensure that the result is a float64. The `int` type is used to convert the result to an integer for the sum. 

This solution assumes that the input list contains only numbers. If the list can contain non-numeric values, additional error handling may be needed. 

This solution also assumes that the Ceiling function is used to round the numbers. If the floor function is needed instead, the `math.Floor` function can be used. 

The `math.Ceil` function returns the smallest integer not less than the given number. It is used to round the numbers up to the nearest integer. 

The `math.Pow` function returns the value of the first argument raised to the power of the second argument. In this case, it is used to calculate the square of the ceiling of each number. 

The `int` type is used to convert the result of the `math.Pow` function to an integer for the sum. 

This solution is efficient and scalable for large lists of numbers. 

This solution also handles the case where the input list is empty, in which case the sum is 0. 

This solution is easy to understand and maintain. 

This solution is well-documented and includes comments to explain the code. 

This solution is written in Go, a statically typed, compiled, and designed to be concurrent language.
