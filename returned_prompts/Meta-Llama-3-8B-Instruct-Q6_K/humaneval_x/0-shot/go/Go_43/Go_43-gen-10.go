Explanation:
The function `PairsSumToZero` takes a list of integers as an input and returns `true` if there are two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and `false` otherwise.

The function uses a `map` to keep track of the elements it has seen so far. It iterates over the list, and for each element, it checks if its negative is present in the `map`. If it is, then it means that there are two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, so the function returns `true`.

If the function finishes iterating over the list without finding a pair of elements that sum to zero, it returns `false`.

The `make(map[int]bool)` line creates a new `map` with integer keys and boolean values. The `range` loop iterates over the list, and for each element, it checks if its negative is present in the `map` using the `_, ok := set[-val]; ok` line. The `set[val] = true` line adds the element to the `map`.

The function is tested with several examples, and the expected output is printed for each example. For example, `>>> PairsSumToZero([2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7])` returns `true` because there are two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, namely `-5` and `5`. On the other hand, `>>> PairsSumToZero([1])` returns `false` because there are no two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero.  The function is designed to handle lists of any size, not just the small lists shown in the examples.  It is also designed to handle lists with duplicate elements.  If a list has multiple pairs of elements that sum to zero, the function will still return `true`.  If a list has no pairs of elements that sum to zero, the function will still return `false`.  If a list has only one element, the function will return `false`.  If a list is empty, the function will return `false`.  The function is case sensitive and will treat `-5` and `
