Z:

The problem is asking to check if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. This can be achieved by using a stack data structure. We iterate over the string of brackets. When we encounter an opening bracket, we push it onto the stack. When we encounter a closing bracket, we check if the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is an opening bracket. If both conditions are met, we pop the opening bracket from the stack. If the stack is empty or the top of the stack is not an opening bracket, we return false. Finally, we check if the stack is empty. If it is, it means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and we return true. If the stack is not empty, it means there are opening brackets without corresponding closing brackets, and we return false.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. The space complexity is also O(n), as in the worst case, the stack can contain n elements.
