This function uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is not empty and if it is, it pops the opening bracket from the stack. If the stack is empty and it encounters a closing bracket, it returns false. At the end, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, it means all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets, so it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false. This function works for any string of brackets, not just "<" and ">".

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the brackets string. The space complexity is also O(n), as in the worst case, the stack will store all the opening brackets. 





The function `CorrectBracketing` takes a string `brackets` as input and returns a boolean indicating whether every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

The function uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. It iterates over the string `brackets`, and for each character:

- If the character is an opening bracket (`'<''`), it pushes it onto the stack.
- If the character is a closing bracket (`'>''`), it checks if the stack is not empty. If it is, it pops the opening bracket from the stack. If the stack is empty, it returns `false`, indicating that there is no corresponding opening bracket for the closing bracket.
- If the stack is empty and the character is a closing bracket, it returns `false`, indicating that there is no corresponding opening bracket for the closing bracket.

After iterating over the entire string, the function checks if the stack is empty. If it is, it returns `true`, indicating that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. If the stack is not empty, it returns `false`, indicating that there are some opening brackets without corresponding closing brackets.

The function works correctly for any string of brackets, not just "<" and ">". It has a
