Here is the solution using a stack:
```go
func CorrectBracketing(brackets string) bool {
    stack := []rune{}
    for _, r := range brackets {
        if r == '<' {
            stack = append(stack, r)
        } else if r == '>' {
            if len(stack) == 0 || stack[len(stack)-1] != '<' {
                return false
            }
            stack = stack[:len(stack)-1]
        }
    }
    return len(stack) == 0
}
```
Explanation:

1. We use a slice of runes (`[]rune`) as a stack.
2. We iterate over each character in the input string.
3. If we encounter an opening bracket (`'<`), we push it onto the stack.
4. If we encounter a closing bracket (`'>`), we check if the stack is empty or if the top element of the stack is not an opening bracket. If either condition is true, we return `false`.
5. If the stack is not empty, we pop the top element from the stack (which should be an opening bracket).
6. Finally, we return `true` if the stack is empty (i.e., all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets), and `false` otherwise.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string, since we iterate over the string once. The space complexity is O(n) as well, since in the worst case (when the input string is entirely composed of opening brackets), we need to store all of them in the stack.
