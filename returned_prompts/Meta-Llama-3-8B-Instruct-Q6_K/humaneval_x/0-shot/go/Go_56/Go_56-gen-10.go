This Go program uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. For each character in the string, if it's an opening bracket (`<`), we push it onto the stack. If it's a closing bracket (`>`), we check if the stack is empty. If it is, that means there's no corresponding opening bracket, so we return `false`. If the stack is not empty, we pop the opening bracket off the stack. After going through all the characters, if the stack is empty, that means every opening bracket had a corresponding closing bracket, so we return `true`. If the stack is not empty, that means there were some opening brackets that didn't have corresponding closing brackets, so we return `false`.
