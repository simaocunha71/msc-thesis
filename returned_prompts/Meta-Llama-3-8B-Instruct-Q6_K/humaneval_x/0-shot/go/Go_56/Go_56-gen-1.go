The problem is asking to check if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the given string of brackets.

Here's a simple solution in Go:

```go
func CorrectBracketing(brackets string) bool {
    stack := []rune{}
    for _, c := range brackets {
        if c == '<' {
            stack = append(stack, c)
        } else if c == '>' {
            if len(stack) == 0 || stack[len(stack)-1] != '<' {
                return false
            }
            stack = stack[:len(stack)-1]
        }
    }
    return len(stack) == 0
}
```

In this solution, we use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. When we encounter an opening bracket, we push it onto the stack. When we encounter a closing bracket, we check if the stack is empty or the top of the stack is not an opening bracket. If either condition is true, we return false. If the stack is not empty after processing all the brackets, we return false. Otherwise, we return true. This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string. The space complexity is O(n) as well, where n is the number of opening brackets in the input string.
