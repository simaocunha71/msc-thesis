// Write a function VowelsCount which takes a string representing
// a word as input and returns the number of vowels in the string.
// Vowels in this case are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'. Here, 'y' is also a
// vowel, but only when it is at the end of the given word.
// 
// Example:
// >>> VowelsCount("abcde")
// 2
// >>> VowelsCount("ACEDY")
// 3

            count++
        } else if v == 'y' && s[len(s)-1] == v {
            count++
        }

This function `VowelsCount` takes a string `s` as input and returns the number of vowels in the string. It first converts the input string to lowercase using the `strings.ToLower` function to ensure the function works correctly for uppercase vowels. 

Then, it iterates over each character `v` in the string using a range-based loop. If the character is 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', or 'u', it increments the `count` variable. 

If the character is 'y' and it's the last character in the string, it also increments the `count` variable. This is because 'y' is considered a vowel only when it's at the end of the word, as per the problem statement.

Finally, the function returns the total count of vowels in the string. 

In the `main` function, we test the `VowelsCount` function with the examples provided in the problem statement. The output is as expected. 

This function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because it iterates over each character in the string once. The space complexity is O(1), which means the space usage does not change with
