```go
func MakeAPile(n int) []int {
    result := make([]int, n)
    odd, even := 1, 2
    for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
        if i % 2 == 0 {
            result[i] = even
            even += 2
        } else {
            result[i] = odd
            odd += 2
        }
    }
    return result
}
```



The function `MakeAPile` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a slice of integers representing the number of stones in each level of the pile.

The function initializes an empty slice `result` with a length of `n`, and two integer variables `odd` and `even` to keep track of the next odd and even numbers respectively.

The function then iterates `n` times, and in each iteration, it checks if the current level is even or odd using the modulo operator `%`. If the level is even, it assigns the current value of `even` to the `result` slice, and increments `even` by 2. If the level is odd, it assigns the current value of `odd` to the `result` slice, and increments `odd` by 2.

Finally, the function returns the `result` slice.

For example, if we call `MakeAPile(3)`, the function will return the slice `[3, 5, 7]`, which represents the number of stones in each level of the pile. The first level has 3 stones, the second level has 5 stones, and the third level has 7 stones.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the input integer. The space complexity is also O(n), as we need to store the result in a slice of length n.
