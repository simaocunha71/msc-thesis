```go
func MakeAPile(n int) []int {
    result := make([]int, n)
    for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
        if i % 2 == 0 {
            result[i] = i * 2 + 1
        } else {
            result[i] = i * 2
        }
    }
    return result
}
```

Explanation:
The function `MakeAPile` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of integers representing the number of stones in each level of the pile.

The list is initialized with `n` elements using the `make` function. Then, a for loop is used to calculate the number of stones in each level. If the level number `i` is even, the number of stones is the next even number, which is calculated as `i * 2`. If the level number `i` is odd, the number of stones is the next odd number, which is calculated as `i * 2 + 1`.

Finally, the list of stones in each level is returned. For example, if `n` is 3, the function returns `[3, 5, 7]`, which represents the number of stones in each level of the pile. The first level has 3 stones, the second level has 5 stones, and the third level has 7 stones.
