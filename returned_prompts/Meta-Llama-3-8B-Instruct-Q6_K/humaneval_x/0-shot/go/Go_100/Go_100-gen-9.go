```go
func MakeAPile(n int) []int {
    result := make([]int, n)
    for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
        if i%2 == 0 {
            result[i] = i * 2 + 1
        } else {
            result[i] = i * 2
        }
    }
    return result
}
```



Explanation:

The problem is asking to create a list of numbers representing the number of stones in each level of a pile. The number of stones in each level is determined by whether the level number is odd or even.

If the level number is odd, the number of stones in that level is the next odd number, which is calculated by `i * 2 + 1`. If the level number is even, the number of stones in that level is the next even number, which is calculated by `i * 2`.

The function `MakeAPile` takes an integer `n` as input, creates a slice of `n` elements, and then iterates over the slice to calculate the number of stones in each level. If the level number is odd, it calculates the next odd number and assigns it to the corresponding element in the slice. If the level number is even, it calculates the next even number and assigns it to the corresponding element in the slice. Finally, it returns the slice.

For example, if `n` is 3, the function will create a slice `[3, 0, 0]`, then calculate the number of stones in each level as follows: `result[0] = 3`, `result[1] = 4`, and `result[2] = 6`. The function will return the slice `[3, 4, 6]`.
