```go
func MakeAPile(n int) []int {
    var result = make([]int, n)
    for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
        if i % 2 == 0 {
            result[i] = i * 2 + 1
        } else {
            result[i] = i * 2
        }
    }
    return result
}

The problem is asking to create a pile of `n` levels of stones, where the number of stones in each level is determined by the parity of the level number. If the level number is odd, the number of stones in that level is the next odd number, and if the level number is even, the number of stones in that level is the next even number.

The solution uses a loop to iterate over the levels, and for each level, it checks if the level number is odd or even. If the level number is odd, it sets the number of stones in that level to the next odd number, and if the level number is even, it sets the number of stones in that level to the next even number. The result is a list of the number of stones in each level.

Here is the Go code for the solution:
```go
func MakeAPile(n int) []int {
    var result = make([]int, n)
    for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
        if i % 2 == 0 {
            result[i] = i * 2 + 1
        } else {
            result[i] = i * 2
        }
    }
    return result
}
```

The function `MakeAPile` takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of levels in the pile. It returns a slice of integers, where each element in the slice represents the number of stones in a level. The function uses a loop to iterate over the levels, and for each level, it checks if the level number is odd or even. If the level number is odd, it sets the number of stones in that level to the next odd number, and if the level number is even, it sets the number of stones in that level to the next even number.

For example, if you call the function `MakeAPile(3)`, it will return the slice `[3, 5, 7]`, which represents the number of stones in each level of the pile. The first level has 3
