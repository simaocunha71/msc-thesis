Here is the solution in Go:

```go
import (
    "math"
)

func DoAlgebra(operator []string, operand []int) int {
    if len(operator) != len(operand) - 1 {
        panic("Invalid input")
    }
    result := operand[0]
    for i := 0; i < len(operator); i++ {
        switch operator[i] {
        case "+":
            result += int(math.Abs(float64(operand[i+1])))
        case "-":
            result -= int(math.Abs(float64(operand[i+1])))
        case "*":
            result *= int(math.Abs(float64(operand[i+1])))
        case "//":
            result = result / int(math.Abs(float64(operand[i+1])))
        case "**":
            result = int(math.Pow(float64(result), float64(operand[i+1])))
        }
    }
    return result
}
```


The provided Go function `DoAlgebra` takes two input lists, `operator` and `operand`, and returns the result of evaluating the algebraic expression built from these two lists. 

The function first checks if the lengths of the `operator` and `operand` lists are valid. If not, it panics with an error message. 

Then, it initializes the result variable with the first element of the `operand` list. 

Next, it iterates over the `operator` list. For each operator, it applies the corresponding operation to the result and the next element in the `operand` list. The operations are performed using the `math` package for exponentiation and floor division. 

Finally, the function returns the result of the algebraic expression evaluation. 

The provided example in the problem statement is correctly evaluated by this function, and the result is 9. 

Please note that the function does not handle invalid inputs, such as non-numeric operands or invalid operations. It is recommended to add input validation to make the function more robust.
