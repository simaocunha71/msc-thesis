```go
return (a * h) / 2.0
```


Output:
```go
7.5
```
Explanation:

This Go function calculates the area of a triangle given the length of a side (`a`) and the height (`h`). The formula used is `(a * h) / 2.0`, which is the formula for the area of a triangle.

In the example, the input values are `a = 5` and `h = 3`, so the output is `7.5`. This is calculated by multiplying `a` and `h` and then dividing the result by 2.0. The resulting area is `7.5`.
