The code is written in Go programming language. It defines a function `TriangleArea` that calculates the area of a triangle given the length of a side `a` and the height `h`. The area is calculated using the formula `0.5 * a * h`.

In the `main` function, we call the `TriangleArea` function with arguments `5` and `3`, and print the result to the console. The output is `7.5`.

Here is the complete code:
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println(TriangleArea(5, 3))
}

func TriangleArea(a float64, h float64) float64 {
	return 0.5 * a * h
}
```
When you run this code, it will print `7.5` to the console. This is the area of the triangle with a side length of 5 units and a height of 3 units.
