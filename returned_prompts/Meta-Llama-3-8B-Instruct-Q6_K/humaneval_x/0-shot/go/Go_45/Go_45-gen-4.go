```go
return 0.5 * a * h
```

Explanation:

The formula to calculate the area of a triangle is (base * height) / 2, where the base is the length of one side and the height is the perpendicular distance from the base to the opposite vertex. In this case, we're given the length of the side (a) and the height (h), so we simply multiply them together, divide by 2, and return the result. The `0.5` is used to represent the fraction 1/2, which is multiplied by the product of `a` and `h`. This is a straightforward implementation of the formula.
