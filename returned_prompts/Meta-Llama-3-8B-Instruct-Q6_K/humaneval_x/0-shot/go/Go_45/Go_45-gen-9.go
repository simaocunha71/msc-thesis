```go
return 0.5 * a * h
```


In this problem, we are asked to write a Go function that calculates the area of a triangle given the length of one side (a) and the height (h) of the triangle. The formula for the area of a triangle is 0.5 * a * h, where a is the base of the triangle and h is the height.

The solution is a simple function that takes two float64 arguments (a and h), and returns the area of the triangle calculated using the formula. The function is called `TriangleArea`. The problem does not specify the unit of the input values, but in the unit test, the expected output is 7.5, which suggests that the unit of the input values is likely meters or other linear units.

Here is the solution:

```go
func TriangleArea(a float64, h float64) float64 {
    return 0.5 * a * h
}
```

You can test this function with the following code:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println(TriangleArea(5, 3)) // Output: 7.5
}
```


This code will print 7.5, which is the expected output for the given input values.
