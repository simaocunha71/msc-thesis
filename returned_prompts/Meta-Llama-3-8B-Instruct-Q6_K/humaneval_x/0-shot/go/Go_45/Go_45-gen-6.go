The formula to calculate the area of a triangle is `(base * height) / 2`. In this case, the base is the length of the side (`a`) and the height is the height (`h`). 

Here is the correct implementation in Go:
```go
func TriangleArea(a float64, h float64) float64 {
    return (a * h) / 2
}
```


For example, if you call `TriangleArea(5, 3)`, it will return `7.5`. This is because the area of a triangle with a base of 5 and a height of 3 is `(5 * 3) / 2 = 7.5`.
