```go
return (a * h) / 2.0
```



Solution:
```
return (a * h) / 2.0
```



This solution calculates the area of a triangle using the formula `Area = (base * height) / 2`, where `base` is the length of the side and `height` is the height of the triangle. The result is returned as a floating-point number.
