```go
return 0.5 * a * h
```


Solution:
```go
return 0.5 * a * h
```


Note: The formula for the area of a triangle is (base * height) / 2, where base is the length of the side and height is the height of the triangle. In this case, the base is `a` and the height is `h`, so the area is `(a * h) / 2`, which can be simplified to `0.5 * a * h`. This is the solution provided in the problem statement.
