1. The function `IsPalindrome` takes a string as input and checks if it is a palindrome.
2. It first cleans the text by removing spaces and converting it to lowercase.
3. Then, it compares the cleaned text with its reverse.
4. If the text is a palindrome, the characters at the same positions in the original text and its reverse should be the same.
5. If the characters are not the same, the function returns `false`.
6. If the loop completes without finding any mismatches, the function returns `true`.

The `main` function tests the `IsPalindrome` function with different inputs and prints the results.

The output of the program will be:
