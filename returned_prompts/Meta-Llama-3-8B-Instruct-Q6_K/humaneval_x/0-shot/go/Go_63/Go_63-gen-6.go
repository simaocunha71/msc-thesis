The provided solution is a function that calculates the n-th element of the Fibfib number sequence. It is an efficient solution with a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1).

Here is the explanation of the solution:

1. The function first checks if n is less than or equal to 1. If it is, the function returns 0, as defined by the problem.
2. If n is equal to 2, the function returns 1, as defined by the problem.
3. The function then initializes three variables a, b, and c to
