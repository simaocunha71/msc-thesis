The problem is asking to create a function that calculates the nth element of the Fibfib sequence, which is defined as Fibfib(0) = 0, Fibfib(1) = 0, Fibfib(2) = 1, and Fibfib(n) = Fibfib(n-1) + Fibfib(n-2) + Fibfib(n-3) for n > 2.

Here is a Python solution using dynamic programming:

```python
def Fibfib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        fibfib_values = [0, 0, 1]
        for i in range(3, n + 1):
            fibfib_values.append(fibfib_values[i-1] + fibfib_values[i-2] + fibfib_values[i-3])
        return fibfib_values[n]
```

This function initializes a list `fibfib_values` with the base cases of the sequence (0, 0, 1). It then iterates from 3 to `n` (inclusive), calculating each element of the sequence as the sum of the previous three elements. Finally, it returns the `n`th element of the sequence.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), as it needs to store the sequence up to the `n`th element. However, this is the most efficient solution for this problem, as the time complexity cannot be improved without using a more complex data structure or algorithm. The space complexity can be improved to O(1) by using a iterative approach, but this would make the code more complex and harder to understand.
