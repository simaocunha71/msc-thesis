```go
func Eat(number, need, remaining int) []int {
    total := number + need
    if total > remaining {
        total = remaining
    }
    return []int{total, remaining - total}
}
```


This function takes three parameters: `number` (the number of carrots that you have Eaten), `need` (the number of carrots that you need to Eat), and `remaining` (the number of remaining carrots that exist in stock).

It calculates the total number of carrots that you have Eaten after your meals by adding the `number` and `need`. Then, it checks if the total number of carrots exceeds the `remaining` number of carrots. If it does, it sets the total number of carrots to the `remaining` number of carrots, which means you will Eat all the remaining carrots but will still be hungry.

Finally, it returns an array of two elements: the total number of carrots that you have Eaten after your meals, and the number of carrots left after your meals. If there are not enough remaining carrots, the number of carrots left will be 0.
