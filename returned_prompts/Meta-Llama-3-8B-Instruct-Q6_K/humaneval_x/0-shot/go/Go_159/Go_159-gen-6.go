```
// Create a slice to hold the result
result := make([]int, 2)

// Calculate the total number of carrots eaten
total := number + (remaining - (remaining - need))

// Calculate the remaining carrots
remainingCarrots := remaining - (remaining - need)

// Add the results to the slice
result[0] = total
result[1] = remainingCarrots

// Return the result
return result
```

In this solution, we first create a slice to hold the result. Then, we calculate the total number of carrots eaten by adding the number of carrots already eaten to the number of carrots that need to be eaten. We calculate the remaining carrots by subtracting the number of carrots that need to be eaten from the total number of carrots. Finally, we add the results to the slice and return it.

The time complexity of this solution is O(1), as it involves a constant number of operations. The space complexity is O(1), as it uses a constant amount of space to store the result.
