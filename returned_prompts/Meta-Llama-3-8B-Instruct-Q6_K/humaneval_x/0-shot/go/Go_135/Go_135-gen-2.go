```go
func CanArrange(arr []int) int {
    n := len(arr)
    if n <= 1 {
        return -1
    }
    var max int
    for i := 1; i < n; i++ {
        if arr[i] <= arr[i-1] {
            max = i
        }
    }
    return max
}
```
The code defines a function `CanArrange` that takes an array of integers as input and returns the largest index of an element that is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. If no such element exists, it returns -1.

Here's how the code works:

1. It first checks if the length of the input array is less than or equal to 1. If it is, the function returns -1, as there are no elements to compare.
2. It then initializes a variable `max` to store the largest index of an element that meets the condition.
3. It iterates through the array from the second element to the last element (inclusive), and for each element, it checks if the current element is less than or equal to the previous element. If it is, it updates the `max` variable with the current index.
4. Finally, the function returns the value of `max`.

The examples provided illustrate the expected behavior of the function. For the input `[1,2,4,3,5]`, the function returns `3`, as the element at index `3` (3) is not greater than or equal to the element at index `2` (2). For the input `[1,2,3]`, the function returns -1, as there is no element that meets the condition.
