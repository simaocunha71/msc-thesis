```
func CanArrange(arr []int) int {
    var max int
    for i := 0; i < len(arr); i++ {
        if i > 0 && arr[i] <= arr[i-1] {
            return i - 1
        }
        if arr[i] > max {
            max = arr[i]
        }
    }
    return -1
}
```

Explanation:

This function iterates through the given array and checks if the current element is less than or equal to the previous element. If it finds such an element, it returns the index of the previous element minus one (since array indices start from zero). If no such element is found, it returns -1.

The function keeps track of the maximum element seen so far to ensure that it checks all elements in the array. If the array contains more than one element, it will return the index of the largest element that is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. If the array contains only one element or all elements are in ascending order, it will return -1.
