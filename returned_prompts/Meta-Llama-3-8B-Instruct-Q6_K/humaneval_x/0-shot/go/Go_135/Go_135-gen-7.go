```go
func CanArrange(arr []int) int {
    n := len(arr)
    if n < 2 {
        return -1
    }
    max := 0
    for _, num := range arr {
        if num > max {
            max = num
        }
    }
    for i := 1; i < n; i++ {
        if arr[i] <= arr[i-1] {
            return i - 1
        }
    }
    return -1
}
```


The function CanArrange takes an array of integers as input and returns the largest index of an element which is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. If no such element exists, it returns -1.

The function first checks if the array has less than 2 elements. If it does, it returns -1 because there are not enough elements to compare.

Then, it finds the maximum element in the array to know the range of elements.

After that, it iterates through the array from the second element to the end. If it finds an element that is less than or equal to the previous element, it returns the index of that element.

If it iterates through the entire array without finding such an element, it returns -1.

This function has a time complexity of O(n) because it iterates through the array once. The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the maximum element and the index.
