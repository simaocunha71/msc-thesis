```go
func CanArrange(arr []int) int {
    n := len(arr)
    count := make([]int, 100001)
    for _, num := range arr {
        count[num]++
    }
    max := -1
    for i := 1; i <= 100000; i++ {
        if count[i] > 0 {
            if count[i-1] > 0 {
                max = i - 1
            }
        }
    }
    return max
}
```



The problem requires you to create a function that returns the largest index of an element in the given array that is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. If no such element exists, the function should return -1. The given array will not contain duplicate values.

Here is a Go solution for the problem:

```go
func CanArrange(arr []int) int {
    n := len(arr)
    count := make([]int, 100001)
    for _, num := range arr {
        count[num]++
    }
    max := -1
    for i := 1; i <= 100000; i++ {
        if count[i] > 0 {
            if count[i-1] > 0 {
                max = i - 1
            }
        }
    }
    return max
}
```

This solution first counts the occurrences of each element in the array using a slice of size 100001. Then, it iterates through the slice to find the largest index of an element that is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. If no such element exists, the function returns -1. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the size of the input array. The space complexity is O(1), as the size of the slice is constant.
