Here is the solution for the problem:

```go
func CanArrange(arr []int) int {
    count := make(map[int]int)
    for _, v := range arr {
        count[v]++
    }
    res := -1
    for k, v := range count {
        if k > 0 {
            if v > 0 && (count[k-1]%2 == 0 || count[k-1] == 0) {
                res = k
                break
            }
        }
    }
    return res
}
```

The function `CanArrange` takes an array of integers as input and returns the largest index of an element which is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. If no such element exists, it returns -1.

The function first creates a hashmap `count` to store the frequency of each element in the array.

Then, it iterates over the hashmap and checks if the current element is greater than 0. If it is, it checks if the frequency of the element is greater than 0 and if the frequency of the previous element is even or 0 (since the previous element is not greater than or equal to the current element). If both conditions are met, it updates the result with the current index and breaks the loop.

Finally, it returns the result.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. The space complexity is also O(n), as in the worst case, all elements in the array are unique and the hashmap will store each element once.
