```go
func CanArrange(arr []int) int {
    n := len(arr)
    if n == 0 {
        return -1
    }
    maxIndex := -1
    for i := 1; i < n; i++ {
        if arr[i] <= arr[i-1] {
            maxIndex = i
        }
    }
    return maxIndex
}
```



The function `CanArrange` takes a slice of integers as input and returns the largest index of an element which is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. If no such element exists, it returns -1.

Here is the explanation of the code:
- The function first checks if the input array is empty. If it is, the function returns -1.
- It then initializes `maxIndex` to -1, which will store the largest index of an element that meets the condition.
- The function then iterates through the array from the second element to the end (inclusive). For each element, it checks if the element is less than or equal to the previous element. If it is, it updates `maxIndex` to the current index.
- Finally, the function returns `maxIndex`, which is the largest index of an element that meets the condition. If no such element exists, `maxIndex` remains -1.
