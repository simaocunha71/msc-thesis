The problem can be solved by iterating through the array and keeping track of the maximum index where the current element is less than the previous element. If no such element is found, return -1.

Here's the Go code for the function:

```go
func CanArrange(arr []int) int {
    n := len(arr)
    if n == 0 {
        return -1
    }
    maxIndex := -1
    for i := 1; i < n; i++ {
        if arr[i] <= arr[i-1] {
            maxIndex = i
        }
    }
    return maxIndex
}
```

This function iterates through the array starting from the second element (index 1). If the current element is less than or equal to the previous element, it updates the `maxIndex` variable with the current index. Finally, it returns the `maxIndex` which represents the largest index of an element that is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. If no such element exists, it returns -1.
