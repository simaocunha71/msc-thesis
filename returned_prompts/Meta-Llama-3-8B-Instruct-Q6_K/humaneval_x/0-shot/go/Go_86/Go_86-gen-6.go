Here is a simple solution for this problem in Go. It uses the `sort` package to sort the characters in each word and the `strings` package to replace the words in the string.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sort"
    "strings"
)

func AntiShuffle(s string) string {
    words := strings.Split(s, " ")
    result := make([]string, len(words))

    for i, word := range words {
        bytes := []byte(word)
        sort.Slice(bytes, func(i, j int) bool {
            return bytes[i] < bytes[j]
        })
        result[i] = string(bytes)
    }

    return strings.Join(result, " ")
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(AntiShuffle("Hi"))  // Output: Hi
    fmt.Println(AntiShuffle("hello"))  // Output: ehllo
    fmt.Println(AntiShuffle("Hello World!!!"))  // Output: Hello !!!Wdlor
}
```

This function `AntiShuffle(s string) string` takes a string as an argument, splits it into words, sorts each word in ascending order based on ASCII values, and then joins the words back together with spaces in between. The result is the ordered version of the original string. The `main` function is used to test the `AntiShuffle` function with different inputs.  The output of the program is the ordered version of each input string.  For example, "Hi" remains unchanged because it only contains one word, "hello" becomes "ehllo" because the characters in "hello" are in ascending order, and "Hello World!!!" becomes "Hello !!!Wdlor" because the characters in each word are in ascending order.  The order of the words and the spaces in the original string are preserved.  This means that the spaces are still in the same positions in the output as they were in the input.  The output of the program is the ordered version of each input string.  For example, "Hi" remains unchanged because it only contains one word, "hello" becomes "ehllo" because the characters in "hello" are in ascending order, and "Hello World!!!" becomes "Hello !!!Wdlor" because the characters in each word are in ascending order.
