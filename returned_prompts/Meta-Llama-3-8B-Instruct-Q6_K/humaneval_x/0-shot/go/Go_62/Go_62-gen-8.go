Explanation:

The derivative of a polynomial is a new polynomial where each coefficient is the product of the original coefficient and the degree of the term. In other words, the derivative of `a_n * x^n` is `n * a_n * x^(n-1)`.

In this problem, we are given a polynomial `xs` represented as a list of coefficients, where `xs[0]` is the constant term, `xs[1]` is the coefficient of `x`, `xs[2]` is the coefficient of `x^2`, and so on.

The derivative of this polynomial is a new polynomial where each coefficient is the product of the original coefficient and the degree of the term. For example, the derivative of `3 + x + 2x^2 + 4x^3 + 5x^4` is `1 + 2x + 6x^2 + 12x^3 + 20x^4`.

We can calculate the derivative using the following formula:

`Derivative(xs) = [0, xs[1], 2*xs[2], 3*xs[3], 4*xs[4], ...]`

We can implement this formula using the `append` function in Go. The `append` function takes two arguments: the first is the destination slice, and the second is the slice to be appended. The `...` operator is used to expand the `xs[1:]` slice into individual arguments to the `append` function.

Here is the complete code:

```go
func Derivative(xs []int) []int {
    return append([]int{0}, xs[1:]...)
}
```

This code takes a slice of integers `xs` as input, and returns a new slice of integers representing the derivative of the polynomial. The `append` function is used to create a new slice containing the derivative coefficients. The `...` operator is used to expand the `xs[1:]` slice into individual arguments to the `append` function.

For example, if we call the `Derivative` function with the input `xs = [3, 1, 2, 4, 5]`, the function will return the output `[1, 4, 12, 20]`, which represents the derivative of the polynomial `3 + x + 2x^2 + 4x^3
