This is a simple function that calculates the derivative of a polynomial represented as an array of coefficients. The function iterates over the coefficients, calculates the derivative of each term, and accumulates the results in a new array. The resulting array is then returned. The derivative of a term is calculated as the coefficient of the term multiplied by the exponent of the term, plus 1. The resulting array is then shifted to the right by one position to match the original polynomial's structure.

For example, if the input is `[3, 1, 2, 4, 5]`, the function will return `[1, 4, 12, 20]`, which are the coefficients of the derivative polynomial. If the input is `[1, 2, 3]`, the function will return `[2, 6]`, which are the coefficients of the derivative polynomial.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input array, because it iterates over the array once. The space complexity is also O(n), because it creates a new array to store the result.
