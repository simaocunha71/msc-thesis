```
func Derivative(xs []int) []int {
    result := make([]int, len(xs)-1)
    for i := 1; i < len(xs); i++ {
        result[i-1] = xs[i] * i
    }
    return result
}
```
In this code, we create a new slice `result` with the same length as the input slice `xs` minus one. We then iterate over the input slice starting from the second element (since the first element is not multiplied by x in the derivative), and for each element, we multiply it by its index (which represents the power of x) and store the result in the corresponding index of the `result` slice. Finally, we return the `result` slice. This code assumes that the input slice represents a polynomial in the form `ax^n + bx^(n-1) + ... + c`, where `a`, `b`, ..., `c` are the coefficients of the polynomial. The derivative of this polynomial is `nax^(n-1) + (n-1)bx^(n-2) + ... + c`, which is represented by the output slice.
