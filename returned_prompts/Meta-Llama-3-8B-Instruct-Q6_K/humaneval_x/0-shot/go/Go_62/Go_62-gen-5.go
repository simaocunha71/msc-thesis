Explanation:
The derivative of a polynomial is a new polynomial whose coefficients are the derivatives of the original polynomial's coefficients. The derivative of `x^n` is `n*x^(n-1)`, so we simply multiply each coefficient by its corresponding power and decrement the power.

We use a slice to store the result and append each new coefficient to it. We start at `i = 1` because the derivative of `x^0` is `0`. We stop at `i < len(xs)` because the last coefficient of the polynomial has no derivative.

Finally, we return the result slice. Note that we use the `0, len(xs)-1` length hint to preallocate the result slice, which can improve performance. This is because we know the length of the result slice in advance.
