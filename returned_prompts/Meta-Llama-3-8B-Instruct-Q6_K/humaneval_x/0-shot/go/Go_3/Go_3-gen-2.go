Here is a Python function that implements the described behavior:
```python
def below_zero(operations):
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Here's an explanation of the code:

* We initialize the `balance` variable to 0, which represents the initial balance of the bank account.
* We iterate over the `operations` list using a for loop.
* For each operation, we add it to the `balance`. If the operation is a withdrawal, the `balance` will decrease; if it's a deposit, the `balance` will increase.
* We check if the `balance` has fallen below 0 after each operation. If it has, we immediately return `True`.
* If we reach the end of the loop without the `balance` falling below 0, we return `False`.

You can test this function with the examples you provided:
```python
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # False
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # True
```
The Python function is equivalent to the Go function, and
