Here is a simple solution in Go:
```go
func BelowZero(operations []int) bool {
    balance := 0
    for _, op := range operations {
        balance += op
        if balance < 0 {
            return true
        }
    }
    return false
}
```
Here's an explanation of the code:

* We initialize the `balance` variable to 0, which represents the initial balance of the bank account.
* We iterate over the `operations` slice using a range loop.
* For each operation, we add it to the `balance` variable.
* We check if the `balance` is less than 0. If it is, we return `true` immediately, indicating that the balance fell below zero at some point.
* If we reach the end of the loop without finding a balance below zero, we return `false`, indicating that the balance never fell below zero.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the `operations` slice, since we iterate over the slice once. The space complexity is O(1), since we only use a constant amount of space to store the `balance` variable.
