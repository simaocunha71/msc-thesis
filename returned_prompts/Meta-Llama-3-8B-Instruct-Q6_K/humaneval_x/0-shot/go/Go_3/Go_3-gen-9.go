The problem is asking to implement a function that takes a list of deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account and checks if at any point the balance of the account falls below zero. If it does, the function should return true; otherwise, it should return false.

Here is a simple and efficient solution in Go:

```go
func BelowZero(operations []int) bool {
    balance := 0
    for _, operation := range operations {
        balance += operation
        if balance < 0 {
            return true
        }
    }
    return false
}
```

In this solution, we initialize the balance to zero and then iterate over the operations. For each operation, we add it to the balance. If the balance falls below zero, we immediately return true. If we finish iterating over all operations without the balance falling below zero, we return false. This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of operations, and a space complexity of O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the balance and iterate over the operations.
