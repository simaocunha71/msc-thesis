You can solve this problem using a loop to iterate over the operations. Initialize a variable `balance` to 0. Then, for each operation, add the operation to `balance`. If `balance` ever becomes negative, return `true`. If you've iterated over all operations and `balance` is still 0 or positive, return `false`. Here is a Python implementation:

```python
def BelowZero(operations):
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This function works by initializing `balance` to 0. Then, for each operation in the list `operations`, it adds the operation to `balance`. If `balance` ever becomes negative, it returns `True`. If it iterates over all operations and `balance` is still 0 or positive, it returns `False`. This function will return `True` if the account balance ever falls below zero, and `False` otherwise. Here is an example of how to use this function:

```python
print(BelowZero([1, 2, 3]))  # False
print(BelowZero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # True
```


This function will work correctly for any list of operations, as long as it is non-empty. If the list is empty, the function will return `False`, since the account balance is still 0. If you want to handle the case where the list is empty, you could add a check at the beginning of the function:

```python
def BelowZero(operations):
    if not operations:
        return False
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```


This version of the function will return `False` if the list is empty.
