	"sort"

func main() {
	numbers := []int{1, 2, 3, 2, 4}
	fmt.Println(RemoveDuplicates(numbers))
}

func RemoveDuplicates(numbers []int) []int {
	m := make(map[int]bool)
	list := []int{}
	for _, item := range numbers {

}
```
The above code is a simple implementation of removing duplicates from a slice of integers. It uses a map to keep track of the unique elements and then sorts the result. 

In Go, we have a `map` data structure that can be used to keep track of unique elements. We iterate over the input slice and for each element, we check if it already exists in the map. If it does not exist, we add it to the map and the result slice. 

The result slice is then sorted using the `sort.Ints` function.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the length of the input slice. The space complexity is O(n) because we are storing the unique elements in the result slice and the map. 

This solution is simple and efficient, but it does not preserve the original order of the elements. If the original order is important, we can use a different approach such as using a slice to keep track of the unique elements and then sorting the slice. 

Here is the modified code that preserves the original order:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sort"
)

func main() {
	numbers := []int{1, 2, 3, 2, 4}
	fmt.Println(RemoveDuplicates(numbers))
}

func RemoveDuplicates(numbers []int) []int {
	m := make(map[int]bool)
	result := []int{}
	for _, item := range numbers {
		if _, value := m[item]; !value {
			m[item] = true
			result = append(result, item)
		}
	}
	return result
}
```
This code uses the same approach as before, but it does not sort the result. Instead, it returns the result slice as is, which preserves the original order of the elements. 

This solution has a
