Explanation:
The problem is asking to remove all elements from the input list that occur more than once. The order of the remaining elements should be the same as in the input.

To solve this problem, we can use a map to keep track of the elements we have seen so far. We iterate through the input list and for each element, we check if it's already in the map. If it's not, we add it to the map and also add it to our result list. This way, we ensure that we only keep elements that occur once in the input list.

After we have processed all elements, we sort the result list to ensure that the remaining elements are in the same order as in the input list.

In the main function, we test the RemoveDuplicates function with the input [1, 2, 3, 2, 4] and print the result, which is [1, 3, 4].
