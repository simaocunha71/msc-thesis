// This is a function that calculates the length of a given string. It iterates over each character in the string using a for loop, and increments a counter (length) for each iteration. Finally, it returns the length of the string.

B:
    return len(str)
}
// This is a shorter version of the function. It directly returns the length of the string using the built-in len function in Go. This is a more efficient and idiomatic way to calculate the length of a string in Go.

C:
    if len(str) > 0 {
        return len(str)
    } else {
        return 0
    }
}
// This is a version of the function that handles the case where the input string is empty. It checks if the length of the string is greater than 0, and if so, returns the length. If the length is 0 (i.e., the string is empty), it returns 0. This is a more explicit way to handle the edge case, but it is less efficient and less idiomatic than the built-in len function.
