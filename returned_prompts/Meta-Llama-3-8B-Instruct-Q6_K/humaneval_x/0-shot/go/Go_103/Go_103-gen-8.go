Here is the solution in Go:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "math"
)

func RoundedAvg(n, m int) interface{} {
    if n > m {
        return -1
    }
    sum := 0
    for i := n; i <= m; i++ {
        sum += i
    }
    avg := math.Round(float64(sum) / float64(m-n+1))
    return fmt.Sprintf("0b%b", avg)
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(RoundedAvg(1, 5))  // Output: 0b11
    fmt.Println(RoundedAvg(7, 5))  // Output: -1
    fmt.Println(RoundedAvg(10, 20)) // Output: 0b1111
    fmt.Println(RoundedAvg(20, 33)) // Output: 0b11010
}
```

This program defines a function `RoundedAvg` that calculates the average of integers from `n` to `m` (inclusive), rounds it to the nearest integer, converts it to binary and returns it as a string. If `n` is greater than `m`, it returns -1. In the `main` function, we test this function with different inputs. The `math.Round` function is used to round the average to the nearest integer. The `fmt.Sprintf` function is used to convert the average to binary and return it as a string. The binary representation is prefixed with "0b" to indicate that it's a binary number.
