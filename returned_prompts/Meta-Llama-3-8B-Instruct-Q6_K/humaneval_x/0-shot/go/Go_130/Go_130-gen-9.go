The Tribonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers defined by the recurrence relation `Tri(n) = 1 + n/2` if `n` is even, and `Tri(n) = Tri(n-1) + Tri(n-2) + Tri(n-3)` if `n` is odd. The first few terms of the sequence are 1, 3, 2, 8, 11, 34, 57, 177, ... . This program calculates and returns the first `n+1` terms of the Tribonacci sequence. It uses a loop to calculate each term of the sequence, using the recurrence relation to determine the next term. The result is stored in a slice of floats, which is returned at the end of the function. If `n` is 0, the function returns an empty slice. Otherwise, it initializes the slice with the first three terms of the sequence (1, 3, 2), and then calculates the remaining terms using the recurrence relation. Finally, it returns the slice. The function is called with the argument `n`, which is the number of terms to calculate and return. The function returns a slice of floats, where each element is a term in the Tribonacci sequence. For example, `Tri(3)` returns the slice `[1, 3, 2, 8]`, which are the first four terms of the Tribonacci sequence. The slice is returned as a slice of floats, which allows for easy conversion to other data types if needed. The function can be used to calculate and return the first `n+1` terms of the Tribonacci sequence for any positive integer `n`. The function is efficient and can handle large values of `n`
