The given function `Tri(n int) []float64` takes an integer `n` as an input and returns the first `n+1` numbers of the Tribonacci sequence as a slice of float64. The Tribonacci sequence is defined as follows: Tri(1) = 3, Tri(n) = 1 + n/2 if n is even, and Tri(n) = Tri(n-1) + Tri(n-2) + Tri(n-3) if n is odd. The function uses a for loop to calculate the first `n+1` numbers of the sequence. It first handles the base cases where `n` is 0, 1, or 2. Then it initializes a slice `result` of size `n+1` and fills it with the calculated values. The function returns the `result` slice. The time complexity of this function is O(n) and the space complexity is O(n). The function is able to correctly calculate the Tribonacci sequence up to the given number `n`. It can be used to generate the Tribonacci sequence for any positive integer `n`. The function is also able to handle the edge cases where `n` is 0, 1, or 2. It returns an empty slice for `n` equal to 0, and returns the base cases for `n` equal to 1 or 2. The function is efficient and easy to understand. It can be used in a variety of applications where the Tribonacci sequence is needed. The function is also easy to test and
