```
func IsSimplePower(x int, n int) bool {
    if x < 1 {
        return false
    }
    power := 0
    for {
        if math.Pow(float64(n), float64(power)) == float64(x) {
            return true
        }
        if math.Pow(float64(n), float64(power)) > float64(x) {
            return false
        }
        power++
    }
}
```


Solution:
```
func IsSimplePower(x int, n int) bool {
    if x < 1 {
        return false
    }
    power := 0
    for {
        if math.Pow(float64(n), float64(power)) == float64(x) {
            return true
        }
        if math.Pow(float64(n), float64(power)) > float64(x) {
            return false
        }
        power++
    }
}
```

The function `IsSimplePower` checks if a given number `x` is a simple power of `n`. It does this by iteratively raising `n` to the power of `power` and comparing the result to `x`. If the result equals `x`, it returns `true`, indicating that `x` is a simple power of `n`. If the result exceeds `x`, it returns `false`, indicating that `x` is not a simple power of `n`. If `x` is less than 1, the function returns `false`, as a simple power of `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. The loop continues until the result equals `x` or exceeds `x`. If the loop runs indefinitely, it means that `x` is not a simple power of `n`, and the function returns `false`. The `math.Pow` function is used to calculate the power of `n`. The `float64` type is used to convert the integer values to floating-point numbers, as the `math.Pow` function expects floating-point arguments. The `float64` type is also used to convert the results of the power operation to floating-point numbers, as the `float64` type is used to compare the results to `x`. The function is designed to handle cases where `x` is a simple power of `n` and cases where `x` is not a simple power of `n`. It is also designed to handle cases where `x` is less than 1, as a simple power of `n` must be greater than or equal
