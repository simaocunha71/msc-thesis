The function `IsSimplePower(x int,n int)` checks if a number `x` is a simple power of `n`. It does this by calculating the ceiling of the logarithm base `n` of `x`, which is the exponent of `n` that raised to the power of `n` gives `x`. The `math.Pow` function is then used to calculate `n` to the power of this exponent and checks if it equals `x`. If it does, then `x` is a simple power of `n`, and the function returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`. This function works because the logarithm of a number is the exponent of the base that raised to the power of the base gives the number, and the ceiling of the logarithm gives the smallest integer exponent that achieves this. For example, the logarithm of 8 base 2 is 3, so the smallest integer exponent that gives 8 is 3, which is `n**3`. The `math.Log` function is used to calculate the logarithm, and `math.Ceil` is used to calculate the ceiling of the logarithm. The `float64` type is used to ensure that the calculations are done in floating point arithmetic, which is more precise than integer arithmetic. The `==` operator is used to compare the result of `math.Pow` to `x`, which checks if `x` is a simple power of `n`. If it is, then the function returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`. This function is efficient because it uses the `math.Pow` function to calculate `n` to the power of the exponent, which is a single operation, and the `math.Log` function to calculate the logarithm, which is also a single operation. The `math.Ceil` function is used to calculate the ceiling of the logarithm, which is also a single operation. The function does not require any loops or conditional statements, which makes it efficient and easy to understand. The function also works correctly for all positive integers `x` and `n`, because the `math.Pow` function can handle any positive integer exponent, and the `math.Log` function can handle any positive number. The function does not work correctly for negative integers `x` or `n`, because the `math.Pow`
