```
return math.Pow(float64(n), math.Floor(math.Log(float64(x))/math.Log(float64(n)))) == float64(x)
```


Here is an explanation of the code:

The function `IsSimplePower(x, n)` checks if `x` is a simple power of `n`. A simple power of `n` is a number `x` that can be expressed in the form `n^k` for some integer `k`.

The code uses the `math` package to calculate the logarithm of `x` and `n`, and then checks if the logarithm of `x` divided by the logarithm of `n` is an integer. If it is, then `x` is a simple power of `n`.

The `math.Pow` function is used to calculate the power of `n` to the `k`-th power, where `k` is the integer part of the logarithm of `x` divided by the logarithm of `n`. The `math.Floor` function is used to get the integer part of the logarithm.

The `math.Log` function is used to calculate the natural logarithm of `x` and `n`. The `float64` type is used to convert the integers to floating-point numbers, because the `math` package only works with floating-point numbers.

The function returns `true` if the calculated power of `n` is equal to `x`, and `false` otherwise.

Here is an example of how the function can be used:
```
x := 8
n := 2
if IsSimplePower(x, n) {
    println("x is a simple power of n")
} else {
    println("x is not a simple power of n")
}
```
This code would output "x is a simple power of n" because 8 is a simple power of 2 (8 = 2^3).
