The problem can be solved by simulating the movement of the cars and counting the number of collisions. Here is a simple Python solution:

```python
def CarRaceCollision(n):
    result = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if (i + j) % 2 == 0:
                result += 1
    return result
```

This solution works by iterating over all pairs of cars and checking if they collide. Two cars collide if their sum is even. This is because the cars are moving in opposite directions and will meet at the middle of the road, which is the same as the sum of their distances from the starting point.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) because it needs to iterate over all pairs of cars. The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the result.

This solution can be optimized to O(n) time complexity by using a different approach. The idea is to count the number of cars that are moving left to right and the number of cars that are moving right to left. If the number of cars moving left to right is equal to the number of cars moving right to left, then there will be no collisions. Otherwise, the number of collisions is equal to the absolute difference between the two counts.

Here is the optimized Python solution:

```python
def CarRaceCollision(n):
    left = 0
    for i in range(n):
        left += 1
        if left % 2 == 1:
            return n - left
    return 0
```

This solution works by counting the number of cars moving left to right and returning the number of cars moving right to left minus the count of cars moving left to right if the count is odd. If the count is even, then there are no collisions, so the function returns 0.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) because it only needs to iterate over the cars once. The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the count of cars moving left to right.
