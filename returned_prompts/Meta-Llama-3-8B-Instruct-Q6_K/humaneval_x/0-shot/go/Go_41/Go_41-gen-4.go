```go
func CarRaceCollision(n int) int {
    res := 0
    for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
        for j := 0; j < n; j++ {
            if i != j {
                res += gcd(i, n) * gcd(j, n)
            }
        }
    }
    return res
}

func gcd(a, b int) int {
    for b != 0 {
        a, b = b, a%b
    }
    return a
}
```


In this problem, we are dealing with the concept of the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers. The idea is that two cars will collide if their relative position modulo n is equal to their relative speed. This means that if we have two cars with positions i and j and speeds i % n and j % n, they will collide if i % n == j % n. This happens when i and j have the same remainder when divided by n, which means their GCD is not equal to 1.

The code above calculates the number of collisions by iterating over all pairs of cars and checking if their GCD is not equal to 1. If it's not, that means they will collide and we increment the result counter.

The GCD function is used to calculate the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. It takes two numbers a and b as input and returns their GCD.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) because we are iterating over all pairs of cars. The space complexity is O(1) because we are using a constant amount of space to store the result and the GCD of two numbers.
