The problem is asking to count the number of collisions that occur when two sets of n cars moving in opposite directions on an infinitely long road. The cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they do not change direction after a collision. The collision occurs when a car moving left to right hits a car moving right to left.

To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach. We can initialize two arrays, one for the cars moving left to right and one for the cars moving right to left. Then, we iterate over both arrays and check for collisions.

Here is the Python solution for the problem:

```python
def CarRaceCollision(n):
    collisions = 0
    left_cars = [i for i in range(n)]
    right_cars = [n - i - 1 for i in range(n)]
    left_cars.sort()
    right_cars.sort()
    i = j = 0
    while i < n and j < n:
        if left_cars[i] <= right_cars[j]:
            i += 1
        else:
            j += 1
            collisions += 1
    return collisions
```

In this solution, we first initialize two arrays `left_cars` and `right_cars` with the positions of the cars moving left to right and right to left respectively. Then, we sort both arrays. We use two pointers `i` and `j` to iterate over both arrays. If the current car moving left to right is behind the current car moving right to left, we move the `i` pointer to the next car. If the current car moving left to right is ahead of the current car moving right to left, we move the `j` pointer to the next car and increment the `collisions` counter. We continue this process until we have processed all cars. The final value of `collisions` is the number of collisions that occurred.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the number of cars. The space complexity is O(n) for the two arrays.
