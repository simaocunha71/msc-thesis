```go
func CarRaceCollision(n int) int {
    collisions := 0
    for i := 1; i <= n; i++ {
        for j := 1; j <= n; j++ {
            if i+j <= 2*n {
                collisions++
            }
        }
    }
    return collisions
}
```

The solution provided is a brute force solution that counts all possible pairs of cars that could collide. It has a time complexity of O(n^2) and a space complexity of O(1), where n is the number of cars. This is because it has two nested loops that iterate n times each, and it uses a constant amount of space to store the result. 

However, this solution can be optimized by observing that the number of collisions is equal to the sum of the triangular numbers from 1 to n. The formula for the nth triangular number is Tn = n*(n+1)/2. Therefore, the optimized solution would be:

```go
func CarRaceCollision(n int) int {
    return n * (n + 1) / 2
}
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(1) and a space complexity of O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the result and does not require any loops or iterations. It is much more efficient than the original solution for large values of n. 

The original problem description is a bit unclear, but it seems that the cars are moving in the same direction, and the question is asking how many pairs of cars will collide. If that is the case, then the solution is simply n*(n-1)/2, because each car will collide with all the cars that are moving in the opposite direction. 

However, the problem description also mentions that the cars are driving left to right and right to left, which suggests that the cars are moving in opposite directions. In that case, the solution would be n^2, because each car will collide with all the cars that are moving in the opposite direction. 

I hope this clears up any confusion. Let me know if you have any further questions. 

The time complexity of the original solution is O(n^2) because it uses two nested loops that iterate n times each. The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the result. 

The time complexity of the optimized solution is O(1) because it uses a simple arithmetic operation to calculate the result
