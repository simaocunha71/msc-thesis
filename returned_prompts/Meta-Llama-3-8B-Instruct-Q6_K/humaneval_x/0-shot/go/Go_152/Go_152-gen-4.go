Here is a possible implementation of the `Compare` function in Go:
```go
func Compare(game, guess []int) []int {
    result := make([]int, len(game))
    for i, score := range game {
        diff := int(math.Abs(float64(guess[i] - score)))
        result[i] = diff
    }
    return result
}
```
Here's an explanation of the code:

* We create a new slice `result` of the same length as the `game` and `guess` slices.
* We iterate over the `game` slice using a range loop.
* For each score, we calculate the absolute difference between the guess and the score using the `math.Abs` function.
* We assign the result to the corresponding index in the `result` slice.
* Finally, we return the `result` slice.

You can test this function with the examples you provided:
```go
game1 := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1}
guess1 := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 2, -2}
fmt.Println(Compare(game1, guess1)) // [0 0 0 0 3 3]

game2 := []int{0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 4}
guess2 := []int{4, 1, 1, 0, 0, -2}
fmt.Println(Compare(game2, guess2)) // [4 4 1 0 0 6]
```
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions. ðŸ˜Š
