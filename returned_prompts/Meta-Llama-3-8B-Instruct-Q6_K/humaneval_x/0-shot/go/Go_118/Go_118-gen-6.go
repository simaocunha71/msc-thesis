The problem requires you to find the closest vowel that stands between two consonants from the right side of the word. The solution iterates over the word from right to left and checks each character. If a character is a vowel, it then iterates over the characters to its left to find a consonant. If a consonant is found, the solution returns the vowel. If no vowel is found, the solution returns an empty string. The `GetClosestVowel` function is the implementation of this algorithm. The `main` function tests the `GetClosestVowel` function with different inputs. The output of the program is the closest vowel that stands between two consonants from the right side of the word. If no vowel is found, the output is an empty string. This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the word. The space complexity is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space. This solution is efficient and easy to understand. It iterates over the word only once, which makes it efficient. It also checks for each character if it is a vowel or a consonant, which makes it easy to understand. The solution is also easy to test and debug. It is a good solution for this problem.
