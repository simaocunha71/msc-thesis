The problem is asking to find the count of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1.

Here is the solution in Go:

```go
import (
    "math"
)

func StartsOneEnds(n int) int {
    count := 0
    // Count of n-digit numbers that start with 1
    for i := 1; i <= 9; i++ {
        count += int(math.Pow10(n-1)) - int(math.Pow10(n-1-i)) + 1
    }
    // Count of n-digit numbers that end with 1
    count += n
    return count
}
```

In this solution, we first count the n-digit numbers that start with 1. We do this by subtracting the count of n-digit numbers that start with the next digit (i.e., i+1) from the count of n-digit numbers that start with 1. This is because the count of n-digit numbers that start with i+1 is the same as the count of n-digit numbers that start with 1 minus the count of n-digit numbers that start with i.

Then, we count the n-digit numbers that end with 1. This is simply n, because there are n such numbers.

Finally, we return the total count.
