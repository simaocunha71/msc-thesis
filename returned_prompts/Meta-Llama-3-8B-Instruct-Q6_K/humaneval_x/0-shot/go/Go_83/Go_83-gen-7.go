The problem is asking you to find the number of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1. 

Here's the solution:

```go
import (
    "math"
)

// Given a positive integer n, return the count of the numbers of n-digit
// positive integers that start or end with 1.
func StartsOneEnds(n int) int {
    // The numbers that start with 1 are in the range [10^(n-1), 10^n - 1]
    // The numbers that end with 1 are in the range [1, 10^n - 10^(n-1)]
    // We need to subtract the overlapping range [10^(n-1), 10^n - 10^(n-1)]
    // from the sum of the two ranges
    start := int(math.Pow10(n-1))
    end := int(math.Pow10(n)) - 1
    total := end - start + 1
    end = int(math.Pow10(n)) - int(math.Pow10(n-1))
    total -= end - start + 1
    return total
}
```

This solution calculates the total number of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1. It does this by calculating the number of integers that start with 1 and the number of integers that end with 1, then subtracting the overlapping range from the sum of the two ranges. The overlapping range is the set of integers that both start and end with 1. The solution uses the math.Pow function to calculate the powers of 10. The total number of integers that start or end with 1 is then returned. 

This solution assumes that n is a positive integer. If n is not a positive integer, the function may return incorrect results. You may want to add error checking to handle this case. 

The time complexity of this solution is O(1), because it only involves a constant number of operations. The space complexity is also O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of space.
