return int(math.Pow(10, n-1)) - int(math.Pow(10, n-2)) + n
}  // Time complexity: O(1) and Space complexity: O(1) as it only uses a constant amount of space and time.  // The idea is that the number of n-digit integers that start with 1 is 1 times 10^(n-1), and the number of n-digit integers that end with 1 is 9 times 10^(n-1). So the total number of n-digit integers that start or end with 1 is 1 times 10^(n-1) + 9 times 10^(n-1) - 9 times 10^(n-2), where 9 times 10^(n-2) is to eliminate the overlap of integers that end with 1 and start with 1. So the function returns int(math.Pow(10, n-1)) - int(math.Pow(10, n-2)) + n.
