The problem is asking for the count of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1.

Here's the solution:

```go
import (
    "math"
)

func StartsOneEnds(n int) int {
    // Initialize the count
    count := 0
    
    // If n is 1, the only possible number is 1, so return 1
    if n == 1 {
        return 1
    }
    
    // The numbers that start with 1
    for i := 1; i <= 9; i++ {
        // The numbers that have n digits and start with 1
        for j := 1; j < math.Pow10(n-1); j++ {
            count++
        }
    }
    
    // The numbers that end with 1
    for i := 1; i <= 9; i++ {
        // The numbers that have n digits and end with 1
        if i == 1 {
            count++
        } else {
            for j := 0; j < int(math.Pow10(n-1)); j++ {
                count++
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Return the count
    return count
}
```

The solution works by first checking if n is 1. If it is, the only possible number is 1, so it returns 1. Then it calculates the numbers that start with 1 and the numbers that end with 1. For the numbers that start with 1, it iterates from 1 to 9 and for each number, it iterates from 1 to 10^(n-1) to get the total count. For the numbers that end with 1, it iterates from 1 to 9 and for each number, it iterates from 0 to 10^(n-1) to get the total count. Finally, it returns the total count.
