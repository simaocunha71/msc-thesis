```go
func StartsOneEnds(n int) int {
    // Calculate the count of n-digit positive integers that start with 1
    startWithOne := int(math.Pow(10, n-1)) - int(math.Pow(10, n-2))

    // Calculate the count of n-digit positive integers that end with 1
    endWithOne := int(math.Pow(10, n-1)) % 10

    // Return the sum of the two counts
    return startWithOne + endWithOne
}
```
Explanation:
The problem asks to find the count of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1. To solve this, we need to calculate the count of n-digit positive integers that start with 1 and the count of n-digit positive integers that end with 1.

To calculate the count of n-digit positive integers that start with 1, we can use the formula `10^(n-1) - 10^(n-2)`. This is because the first `n-1` digits of an n-digit number can be any number from 0 to 9, and the last digit can only be 1.

To calculate the count of n-digit positive integers that end with 1, we can use the formula `10^(n-1) % 10`. This is because the last digit of an n-digit number can only be 1.

Finally, we return the sum of the two counts.

In the code, we use the `math.Pow` function to calculate the power of 10, and the `int` function to convert the result to an integer. We also use the `%` operator to calculate the remainder of the division.

The time complexity of this solution is O(1), because we only need to perform a constant number of operations to calculate the counts. The space complexity is O(1), because we only need to use a constant amount of space to store the results.
