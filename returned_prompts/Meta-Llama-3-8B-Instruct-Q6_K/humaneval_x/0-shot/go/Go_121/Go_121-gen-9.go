```go
func Solution(lst []int) int {
    sum := 0
    for i, v := range lst {
        if (i % 2 == 0 && v % 2 != 0) {
            sum += v
        }
    }
    return sum
}
```


Solution: The problem is asking to find the sum of all odd numbers that are in even positions in the given list. 

To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list using a for loop with range. For each element, we check if it is in an even position (i % 2 == 0) and if it is an odd number (v % 2 != 0). If both conditions are true, we add the number to our sum. 

In the end, we return the sum. 

Here is the Go code for the solution:

```go
func Solution(lst []int) int {
    sum := 0
    for i, v := range lst {
        if (i % 2 == 0 && v % 2 != 0) {
            sum += v
        }
    }
    return sum
}
```


This function will return the sum of all odd numbers that are in even positions in the given list. For example, if the input list is [5, 8, 7, 1], the function will return 12, which is the sum of the odd numbers 5 and 7 at even positions 0 and 2. 

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list, because we are iterating through the list once. The space complexity is O(1), because we are using a constant amount of space to store the sum.
