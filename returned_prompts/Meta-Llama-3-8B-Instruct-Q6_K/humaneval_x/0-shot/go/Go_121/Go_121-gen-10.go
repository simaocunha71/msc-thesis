```go
func Solution(lst []int) int {
    var sum int
    for i, num := range lst {
        if i%2 == 0 && num%2 != 0 {
            sum += num
        }
    }
    return sum
}
```



The function `Solution` takes a slice of integers as input and returns the sum of all the odd elements that are in even positions.

The function iterates over the slice using a for loop with a range, where `i` is the index of the element and `num` is the value of the element. 

For each element, it checks if the index `i` is even (`i%2 == 0`) and if the value `num` is odd (`num%2 != 0`). If both conditions are true, it adds the value `num` to the sum.

Finally, the function returns the sum of all the odd elements in even positions. 

For example, for the input `[5, 8, 7, 1]`, the function will return `12`, because the odd elements in even positions are `5` and `7`, and their sum is `12`. 

Similarly, for the input `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`, the function will return `9`, because the odd elements in even positions are `3` and `3`, and their sum is `9`. 

For the input `[30, 13, 24, 321]`, the function will return `0`, because there are no odd elements in even positions. 

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input slice, because it needs to iterate over the entire slice once. The space complexity is O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the sum. 

This function is efficient and easy to understand, and it can handle large input slices without running out of memory or taking a long time to complete.
