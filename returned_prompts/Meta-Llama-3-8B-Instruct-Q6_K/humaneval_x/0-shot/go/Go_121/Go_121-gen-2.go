```go
func Solution(lst []int) int {
    sum := 0
    for i, num := range lst {
        if i%2 == 0 && num % 2 != 0 {
            sum += num
        }
    }
    return sum
}
```


The function `Solution(lst []int)` takes a slice of integers as input and returns the sum of all the odd elements that are in even positions.

Here's how it works:

1. Initialize a variable `sum` to 0, which will be used to store the sum of the odd elements in even positions.
2. Iterate over the input slice `lst` using a range loop, which allows us to access each element and its index.
3. For each element, check if its index `i` is even (`i%2 == 0`) and if the element itself is odd (`num % 2 != 0`). If both conditions are true, add the element to the `sum`.
4. Return the `sum` at the end of the function.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input slice, since we iterate over the slice once. The space complexity is O(1), since we only use a few extra variables to store the sum and the current element.
