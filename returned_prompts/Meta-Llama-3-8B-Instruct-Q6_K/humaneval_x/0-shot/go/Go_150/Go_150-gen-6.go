The program is written in Go and it uses a for loop to iterate from 2 to the input number `n`. It checks if `n` is divisible by any number in this range, and if it is, it returns `y`. If `n` is not divisible by any number in this range, it is considered a prime number and the function returns `x`.

Here's the breakdown of the program:

1. The `XOrY` function takes three integer parameters: `n`, `x`, and `y`.
2. The function iterates over all numbers from 2 to `n` using a for loop.
3. For each number
