```go
func Multiply(a, b int) int {
    unitA, unitB := a % 10, b % 10
    return unitA * unitB
}
```



Explanation:

The problem asks to create a function that takes two integers as input and returns the product of their unit digits. The unit digit of a number is the last digit of the number. For example, the unit digit of 148 is 8.

The function `Multiply` takes two integers `a` and `b` as input, calculates the unit digits of `a` and `b` using the modulo operator (`%`), and returns the product of these unit digits.

For example, when `a` is 148 and `b` is 412, the function calculates the unit digits as `a % 10 = 8` and `b % 10 = 2`, and returns the product `8 * 2 = 16`.

The unit tests provided ensure that the function works correctly for different input values. The function is simple and efficient, with a time complexity of O(1) because it only performs a constant number of operations.
