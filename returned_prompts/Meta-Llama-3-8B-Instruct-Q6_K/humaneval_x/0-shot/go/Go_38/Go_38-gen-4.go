The provided code seems to be a part of a program that encodes and decodes strings using a cyclic shift of characters. The `EncodeCyclic` function takes a string as input, splits it into groups of three characters, and then shifts each group by one position to the right (wrapping around to the start of the group if necessary). The resulting groups are then concatenated to form the encoded string.

The `DecodeCyclic` function takes an encoded string as input, splits it into groups of characters, and then shifts each group back to its original position. The resulting groups are then concatenated to form the decoded string.

Here is the corrected code for the `DecodeCyclic` function:

```go
func DecodeCyclic(s string) string {
    groups := strings.Split(s, "")
    newGroups := make([]string, 0)
    for _, group := range groups {
        runes := []rune(group)
        if len(group) > 1 {
            newGroups = append(newGroups, string(append([]rune{runes[1]}, runes[0])))
        } else {
            newGroups = append(newGroups, group)
        }
    }
    decoded := strings.Join(newGroups, "")
    return decoded
}
```

This code splits the input string into groups of characters, shifts each group back to its original position, and then concatenates the groups to form the decoded string. The `strings.Join` function is used to concatenate the groups, and the `strings.Split` function is used to split the input string into groups. The `append` function is used to add elements to the `newGroups` slice. The `rune` type is used to represent individual characters in the string, and the `[]rune` type is used to represent a slice of runes. The `string` function is used to convert the `[]rune` slice back to a string.
