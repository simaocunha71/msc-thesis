The problem is asking to implement a function called `EncodeCyclic` that takes a string as input and returns an encoded string by cycling groups of three characters. The function should also implement a `DecodeCyclic` function that takes an encoded string and returns the original string.

Here's the solution:

```go
package main

import (
    "math"
    "strings"
    "time"
)

// returns encoded string by cycling groups of three characters.
func EncodeCyclic(s string) string {
    groups := make([]string, 0)
    for i := 0; i < ((len(s) + 2) / 3); i++ {
        groups = append(groups, s[3*i:int(math.Min(float64(3*i+3), float64(len(s))))])
    }
    newGroups := make([]string, 0)
    for _, group := range groups {
        runes := []rune(group)
        if len(group) == 3 {
            newGroups = append(newGroups, string(append(runes[1:], runes[0])))
        } else {
            newGroups = append(newGroups, group)
        }
    }
    return strings.Join(newGroups, "")
}

// takes as input string encoded with EncodeCyclic function. Returns decoded string.
func DecodeCyclic(s string) string {
    groups := strings.Split(s, "")
    decoded := ""
    for i := 0; i < len(groups); i++ {
        if len(groups[i]) == 3 {
            decoded += groups[i][1] + groups[i][0]
        } else {
            decoded += groups[i]
        }
    }
    return decoded
}

func main() {
    testString := "Hello, World!"
    encoded := EncodeCyclic(testString)
    decoded := DecodeCyclic(encoded)
    if decoded == testString {
        println("Test passed!")
    } else {
        println("Test failed!")
    }
}
```

In the `EncodeCyclic` function, we first split the input string into groups of three characters. If a group has less than three characters, we leave it as is. Then we cycle the characters in each group by appending the second character to the end of the group and moving the first character to the second position.

In the `DecodeCyclic` function, we split the encoded string into groups. If a group has three characters, we cycle the characters back to their original order. If a group has less than three characters, we leave it as
