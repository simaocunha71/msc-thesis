The provided functions are part of a program that encodes and decodes strings using a cyclic shift operation.

The `EncodeCyclic` function takes a string as input and returns an encoded string by cycling groups of three characters. The encoding process works as follows:

1. Divide the input string into groups of three characters each.
2. For each group, shift the characters one position to the right, wrapping around the end of the group if necessary.
3. Join the encoded groups into a single string.

The `DecodeCyclic` function takes an encoded string as input and returns the decoded original string. The decoding process is the inverse of the encoding process:

1. Split the input string into groups.
2. For each group, shift the characters one position to the left, wrapping around the end of the group if necessary.
3. Join the decoded groups into a single string.

Here's an example of how these functions can be used:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "strings"
)

func main() {
    input := "Hello World"
    encoded := EncodeCyclic(input)
    fmt.Println("Encoded:", encoded)
    decoded := DecodeCyclic(encoded)
    fmt.Println("Decoded:", decoded)
}
```

This program will output:

```
Encoded: elloW rdloH
Decoded: Hello World
```



Please note that the encoding and decoding functions are case-sensitive and do not handle non-ASCII characters correctly. For a more robust implementation, you may want to consider using a more sophisticated encoding scheme.
