The problem is asking to write a function that encodes a given string by cycling groups of three characters, and another function that decodes the encoded string back to the original string.

Here is the solution:

```go
import (
    "math"
    "strings"
    "time"
)

// returns encoded string by cycling groups of three characters.
func EncodeCyclic(s string) string {
    groups := make([]string, 0)
    for i := 0; i < ((len(s) + 2) / 3); i++ {
        groups = append(groups, s[3*i:int(math.Min(float64(3*i+3), float64(len(s))))])
    }
    newGroups := make([]string, 0)
    for _, group := range groups {
        runes := []rune(group)
        if len(group) == 3 {
            newGroups = append(newGroups, string(append(runes[1:], runes[0])))
        } else {
            newGroups = append(newGroups, group)
        }
    }
    return strings.Join(newGroups, "")
}

// takes as input string encoded with EncodeCyclic function. Returns decoded string.
func DecodeCyclic(s string) string {
    newGroups := make([]string, 0)
    for i := 0; i < len(s); i += 2 {
        if i+2 <= len(s) {
            newGroups = append(newGroups, string(rune(s[i])) + string(s[i+1:i+3]))
        } else if i+1 <= len(s) {
            newGroups = append(newGroups, string(rune(s[i])) + string(s[i+1]))
        } else {
            newGroups = append(newGroups, string(rune(s[i])))
        }
    }
    result := ""
    for _, group := range newGroups {
        result += group
    }
    return result
}
```

The `EncodeCyclic` function works by dividing the input string into groups of three characters. If a group has less than three characters, it is left unchanged. The function then joins these groups together to form the encoded string.

The `DecodeCyclic` function works by dividing the input string into groups of two characters. If a group has only one character, it is left unchanged. The function then joins these groups together to form the decoded string.

Note that this solution assumes that the input string is a valid string that can be encoded and decoded correctly. It does not handle errors or
