The problem is asking you to write two functions, `EncodeCyclic` and `DecodeCyclic`, which are used to encode and decode a string using a cyclic shift of 3 characters.

The `EncodeCyclic` function takes a string as input and returns the encoded string. It works by dividing the input string into groups of 3 characters. If the last group has less than 3 characters, it is not shifted. The function then joins all the groups together to form the encoded string.

The `DecodeCyclic` function takes an encoded string as input and returns the decoded string. It works by dividing the encoded string into groups of characters. If a group has 3 characters, it shifts the first character to the end of the group. The function then joins all the groups together to form the decoded string.

Here is the solution:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "math"
    "strings"
)

// returns encoded string by cycling groups of three characters.
func EncodeCyclic(s string) string {
    groups := make([]string, 0)
    for i := 0; i < ((len(s) + 2) / 3); i++ {
        groups = append(groups, s[3*i:int(math.Min(float64(3*i+3), float64(len(s))))])
    }
    newGroups := make([]string, 0)
    for _, group := range groups {
        runes := []rune(group)
        if len(group) == 3 {
            newGroups = append(newGroups, string(runes[1:]) + string(runes[0]))
        } else {
            newGroups = append(newGroups, group)
        }
    }
    return strings.Join(newGroups, "")
}

// takes as input string encoded with EncodeCyclic function. Returns decoded string.
func DecodeCyclic(s string) string {
    newGroups := make([]string, 0)
    for i := 0; i < ((len(s) + 2) / 3); i++ {
        group := s[3*i : int(math.Min(float64(3*i+3), float64(len(s))))]
        runes := []rune(group)
        if len(group) == 3 {
            newGroups = append(newGroups, string(runes[1:]) + string(runes[0]))
        } else {
            newGroups = append(newGroups, group)
        }
    }
    return strings.Join(newGroups, "")
}

func main()
