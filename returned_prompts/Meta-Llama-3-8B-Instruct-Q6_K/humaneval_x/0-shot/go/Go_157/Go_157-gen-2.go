The problem is asking to write a function that takes three integers as input, which are the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. The function should return true if the three sides form a right-angled triangle and false otherwise.

A right-angled triangle is a triangle where one angle is 90 degrees. This can be checked by using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that for a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

Here is a possible solution in Go:
```go
func RightAngleTriangle(a, b, c int) bool {
    // Check if the input values are valid
    if a <= 0 || b <= 0 || c <= 0 {
        return false
    }
    // Check if the input values form a valid triangle
    if a+b <= c || a+c <= b || b+c <= a {
        return false
    }
    // Check if the input values form a right-angled triangle
    if a*a + b*b == c*c || a*a + c*c == b*b || b*b + c*c == a*a {
        return true
    }
    return false
}
```
This function first checks if the input values are valid (i.e., greater than 0) and if they form a valid triangle (i.e., the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side). Then it checks if the input values form a right-angled triangle by using the Pythagorean theorem. If any of these checks fail, the function returns false. Otherwise, it returns true.

You can test this function with the example you provided:
```go
fmt.Println(RightAngleTriangle(3, 4, 5)) // Output: true
fmt.Println(RightAngleTriangle(1, 2, 3)) // Output: false
```
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
