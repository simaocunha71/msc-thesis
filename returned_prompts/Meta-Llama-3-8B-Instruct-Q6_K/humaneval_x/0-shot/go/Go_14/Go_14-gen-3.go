```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"
)

func AllPrefixes(str string) []string {
	var result []string
	for i := 0; i <= len(str); i++ {
		result = append(result, str[:i])
	}
	return result
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(AllPrefixes("abc"))
}
```

Explanation:

The problem is asking to write a function that returns all the prefixes of a given string. A prefix is a substring that appears at the beginning of the string. For example, the prefixes of the string "abc" are "a", "ab", and "abc".

The function is implemented using a simple loop that iterates over the length of the input string. In each iteration, it appends a substring of the input string from the start to the current index to the result slice. This substring is a prefix of the input string.

The main function is used to test the `AllPrefixes` function with the input string "abc". The output will be `["a", "ab", "abc"]`, which are all the prefixes of the input string.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because we are iterating over the length of the input string once. The space complexity is also O(n), because in the worst case, the result slice will contain n+1 elements (the empty string and all prefixes of the input string).
