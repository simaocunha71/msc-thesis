```go
package main
import "fmt"
func AllPrefixes(str string) []string {
    result := make([]string, 0)
    for i := 0; i <= len(str); i++ {
        result = append(result, str[:i])
    }
    return result
}
func main() {
    fmt.Println(AllPrefixes("abc"))
}
```
This program will output:
```
[a abc]
```
The main problem with this code is that it's trying to create a slice with an index that is one more than the length of the string. In Go, the length of a string is the number of characters it contains, and the valid range for an index is from 0 to the length of the string minus one. So, if you try to access an index that is equal to the length of the string, you will get a runtime error.

To fix this code, you can change the loop to iterate up to the length of the string, and then append the prefix to the result slice. Here is the corrected code:
```go
package main
import "fmt"
func AllPrefixes(str string) []string {
    result := make([]string, 0)
    for i := 0; i < len(str); i++ {
        result = append(result, str[:i+1])
    }
    return result
}
func main() {
    fmt.Println(AllPrefixes("abc"))
}
```
This program will output:
```
[a ab abc]
```
Now, the code will correctly generate all prefixes of the input string, from the shortest to the longest.
