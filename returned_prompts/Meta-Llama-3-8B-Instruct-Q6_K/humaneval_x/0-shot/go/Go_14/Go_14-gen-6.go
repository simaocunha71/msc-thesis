    prefix := ""
    prefixList := []string{}
    for i := 0; i <= len(str); i++ {
        prefix = str[:i]
        prefixList = append(prefixList, prefix)
    }
    return prefixList
}

Solution:
The problem is asking for a function that returns a list of all prefixes from the shortest to the longest of the input string. 

Here's a Python solution for this problem:

```
def AllPrefixes(str):
    prefixList = []
    prefix = ""
    for i in range(len(str) + 1):
        prefix = str[:i]
        prefixList.append(prefix)
    return prefixList
```

This function works by iterating over the length of the input string (inclusive), and at each iteration, it appends a prefix of the input string to the prefixList. The prefix is the substring of the input string from the start to the current index. The function returns the prefixList. 

For example, if the input string is 'abc', the function will return ['a', 'ab', 'abc']. 

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because it needs to iterate over the length of the input string. The space complexity is also O(n), because it needs to store all the prefixes in the prefixList. 

Note: In Go, we can use the code provided in the question as a solution. It's already correct and efficient. It uses a similar approach to the Python solution, but with Go syntax. 

The Go code:

```go
func AllPrefixes(str string) []string {
    prefix := ""
    prefixList := []string{}
    for i := 0; i <= len(str); i++ {
        prefix = str[:i]
        prefixList = append(prefixList, prefix)
    }
    return prefixList
}
``` 

This function is also O(n) time complexity and O(n) space complexity. It works by iterating over the length of the input string (inclusive), and at each iteration, it appends a prefix of the input string to the prefixList. The prefix is the substring of the input string from the start to the current index. The function returns the prefixList. 

For example, if the input string is 'abc', the function will return ['a', 'ab', 'abc'].
