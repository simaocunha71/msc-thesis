The provided solution is not entirely correct. The problem description states that the function should shift every character by 5 places in the alphabet, but the provided solution only shifts characters that are within the range of 'a' to 'z' or 'A' to 'Z'. This means that characters that are outside this range will not be shifted.

To fix this, the solution should shift all characters, regardless of whether they are letters or not. Here is the corrected solution:

```go
// returns encoded string by shifting every character by 5 in the alphabet.
func EncodeShift(s string) string {
    runes := []rune(s)
    newRunes := make([]rune, 0)
    for _, ch := range runes {
        newRunes = append(newRunes, (
