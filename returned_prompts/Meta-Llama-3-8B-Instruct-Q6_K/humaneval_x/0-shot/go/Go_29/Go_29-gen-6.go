```
return filter(strings, func(s string) bool {
    return strings.HasPrefix(s, prefix)
})
```


Here is the explanation:

This problem asks to create a function `FilterByPrefix` that takes two inputs: a list of strings `strings` and a prefix `prefix`. The function should return a new list containing only the strings from the original list that start with the given prefix.

The solution uses the `filter` function, which is a higher-order function that takes a list and a predicate function as inputs. The predicate function takes an element of the list and returns a boolean value indicating whether the element should be included in the filtered list. In this case, the predicate function checks whether a string starts with the given prefix using the `HasPrefix` method.

The `FilterByPrefix` function calls the `filter` function with the original list, the predicate function, and returns the result. This way, we can filter the list of strings to only include the ones that start with the given prefix.
