The function `SameChars` takes two strings `s0` and `s1` as input and checks if they have the same characters. 

First, it checks if the lengths of the two strings are equal. If they are not, it returns `false` immediately because strings with different lengths cannot have the same characters.

Then, it creates a map `counts` to count the occurrences of each rune (character) in `s0`. It iterates over each rune in `s0` and increments the count in the map.

Next, it iterates over each rune in `s1` and decrements the count in the map. If a rune is not present in `s0`, the count will be decremented to a negative value, which is okay because we are checking if the counts are all zero at the end.

Finally, it iterates over the `counts` map and checks if any count is not zero. If any count is not zero, it means that `s0` and `s1` have different characters, so it returns `false`. If all counts are zero, it means that `s0` and `s1` have the same characters, so it returns `true`.

The `main` function tests the `SameChars` function with different input strings. The output will be `true` for the strings that have the same characters and `false` for the strings that do not.
