def SameChars(s0, s1):
    return sorted(s0) == sorted(s1)
```
Explanation:

The problem is asking to check if two given words have the same characters, regardless of their order. This can be achieved by sorting the characters in each word and comparing the results.

In the given Python code, the `sorted()` function is used to sort the characters in each word. The `==` operator is then used to compare the sorted lists of characters. If the lists are equal, it means that the original words have the same characters.

This approach works because sorting the characters in each word removes any information about their original order, leaving only the character frequencies. If two words have the same character frequencies, they must have the same characters, regardless of their order.

For example, the words 'eabcdzzzz' and 'dddzzzzzzzddeddabc' have the same characters, even though they are in different orders. The `sorted()` function will produce the same sorted list of characters for both words: ['abc', 'd', 'z', 'z', 'z']. Therefore, the `==` operator will return `True` for these two words. On the other hand, the words 'eabcd' and 'dddddddabc' have different characters, so the `sorted()` function will produce different sorted lists of characters, and the `==` operator will return `False`.
