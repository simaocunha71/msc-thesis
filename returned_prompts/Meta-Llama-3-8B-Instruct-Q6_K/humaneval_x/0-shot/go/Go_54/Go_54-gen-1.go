Explanation:
This function takes two strings as input and checks if they have the same characters. It does this by converting each string to a map of characters to their frequencies. It then checks if the two maps are the same by using the `reflect.DeepEqual` function, which returns true if the two values are equal and false otherwise. If the two maps are the same, it means that the two strings have the same characters, so the function returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.
