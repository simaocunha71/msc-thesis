B:
var count int = 0
for i := 1; i < n; i++ {
    if strings.Contains(strconv.Itoa(i), "7") {
        if i%11 == 0 || i%13 == 0 {
            count++
        }
    }
}
return count
}

C:
var count int = 0
for i := 1; i < n; i++ {
    if strings.Contains(strconv.Itoa(i), "7") {
        if i%11 == 0 || i%13 == 0 {
            count++
        }
    }
}
return count
}

D:
var count int = 0
for i := 1; i < n; i++ {
    if strings.Contains(strconv.Itoa(i), "7") {
        if i%11 == 0 || i%13 == 0 {
            count++
        }
    }
}
return count
} // end of solution

Solution:
The correct solution is A.

Explanation:
The problem is asking for the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13. The solution can be broken down into three parts:

1. Convert the integer to a string using strconv.Itoa to check if the digit 7 is present.
2. Check if the integer is divisible by 11 or 13 using the modulus operator (%).
3. If the integer is divisible by 11 or 13 and contains the digit 7, increment the count.

The solution provided in A, B, C, and D is correct and implements the above steps. However, the problem statement is unclear, and a more descriptive title would be "Counting occurrences of the digit 7 in numbers divisible by 11 or 13". // end of solution

This is a solution for the problem. It uses the strconv.Itoa function to convert the integer to a string and then uses the strings.Contains function to check if the digit 7 is present in the string. If the digit 7 is present, it checks if the integer is divisible by 11 or 13 using the modulus operator (%). If it is divisible and contains the digit 7, it increments the count.
