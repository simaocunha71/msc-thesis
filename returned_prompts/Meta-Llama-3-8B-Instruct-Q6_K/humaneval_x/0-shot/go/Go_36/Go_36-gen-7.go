Explanation:

The function FizzBuzz takes an integer n as input and returns the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.

The function iterates from 1 to n-1 and checks if the current integer is divisible by 11 or 13. If it is, it converts the integer to a string and checks if the string contains the character '7'. If it does, it increments the count.

The function returns the count at the end.

For example, if n is 50, the function will return 0 because there are no integers less than 50 that are divisible by 11 or 13 and contain the digit 7. If n is 78, the function will return 2 because the integers 77 and 70 are divisible by 11 or 13 and contain the digit 7. If n is 79, the function will return 3 because the integers 77, 70, and 79 are divisible by 11 or 13 and contain the digit 7.
