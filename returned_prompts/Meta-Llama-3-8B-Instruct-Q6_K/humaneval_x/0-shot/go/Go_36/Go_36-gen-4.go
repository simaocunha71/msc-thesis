This code does not work correctly. It tries to find the digit 7 in all numbers less than `n`, but it also increments the count when the number is divisible by 11 or 13, which is incorrect.

To fix this, we should only increment the count when the number is divisible by 11 or 13, and also contains the digit 7. Here is the corrected code:

```go
func FizzBuzz(n int) int {
	var count int
	for i := 11; i < n; i++ {
		if strings.Contains(strconv.Itoa(i), "7") && (i%11 == 0 || i%13 == 0) {
			count++
		}
	}
	return count
}
```

This code will correctly return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than `n` which are divisible by 11 or 13.
