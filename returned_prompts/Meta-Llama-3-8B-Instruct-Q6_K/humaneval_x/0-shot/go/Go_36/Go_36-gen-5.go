Explanation:

This problem is asking to count the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than `n` which are divisible by 11 or 13. 

The function `FizzBuzz(n int)` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the count of digit 7 in the integers less than `n` which are divisible by 11 or 13.

In the function, we initialize a variable `count` to 0. Then we use a for loop to iterate over all integers from 1 to `n-1`. For each integer, we check if it is divisible by 11 or 13 using the modulus operator `%`. If the integer is divisible by 11 or 13, we convert the integer to a string using `strconv.Itoa(i)` and then iterate over each character in the string using a for loop. If the character is '7', we increment the `count` by 1.

Finally, we return the `count` which is the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than `n` which are divisible by 11 or 13. 

For example, if `n` is 50, the function returns 0 because there is no integer less than 50 which is divisible by 11 or 13 and contains the digit 7. If `n` is 78, the function returns 2 because the integers 77 and 70 are less than 78, divisible by 11 or 13, and contain the digit 7. If `n` is 79, the function returns 3 because the integers 77, 70, and 79 are less than 79, divisible by 11 or 13, and contain the digit 7.
