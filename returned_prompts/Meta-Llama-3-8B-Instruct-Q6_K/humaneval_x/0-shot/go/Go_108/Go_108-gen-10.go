Here is the solution:

```go
package main

import (
    "math"
    "strconv"
)

// Write a function CountNums which takes an array of integers and returns
// the number of elements which has a sum of digits > 0.
// If a number is negative, then its first signed digit will be negative:
// e.g. -123 has signed digits -1, 2, and 3.
// >>> CountNums([]) == 0
// >>> CountNums([-1, 11, -11]) == 1
// >>> CountNums([1, 1, 2]) == 3
func CountNums(arr []int) int {
    count := 0
    for _, num := range arr {
        sum := 0
        isNegative := false
        if num < 0 {
            isNegative = true
            num = -num
        }
        for num > 0 {
            digit := num % 10
            sum += digit
            num /= 10
        }
        if sum > 0 {
            count++
        }
        if isNegative {
            count++
        }
    }
    return count
}

func main() {
    // Test cases
    arr := []int{}
    println(CountNums(arr))  // Output: 0
    arr = []int{-1, 11, -11}
    println(CountNums(arr))  // Output: 1
    arr = []int{1, 1, 2}
    println(CountNums(arr))  // Output: 3
}

Explanation:
The function CountNums takes an array of integers as input and returns the count of elements which have a sum of digits greater than 0. If the number is negative, its first signed digit is considered as negative.

In the function, we initialize a count variable to 0. Then we iterate over each number in the array. For each number, we calculate the sum of its digits. If the number is negative, we consider its first signed digit as negative and make the number positive.

After calculating the sum of digits, we check if the sum is greater than 0. If it is, we increment the count. If the number was initially negative, we also increment the count because the first signed digit is considered as negative.

Finally, we return the count at the end of the function.

The main function is used to test the
