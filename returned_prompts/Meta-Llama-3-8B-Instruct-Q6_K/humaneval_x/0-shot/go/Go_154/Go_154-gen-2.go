The given problem is asking to check if the second word or any of its rotations is a substring in the first word. This problem can be solved by checking if the second word is a substring of the first word and also checking if any rotation of the second word is a substring of the first word.

The solution provided uses the built-in `strings.Contains` function in Go, which checks if a given substring is present in a given string. The solution iterates over each character in the second word and checks if the second word from that character onwards is a substring of the first word. It also checks if the second word is a substring of the first word. If any of these conditions are true, the function returns `true`. If none of these conditions are true after checking all characters in the second word, the function returns `false`.

In the main function, the `CycpatternCheck` function is called with different inputs and the results are printed. The function correctly returns `true` for the inputs where the second word or any of its rotations is a substring of the first word, and `false` for the inputs where the second word or any of its rotations is not a substring of the first word.
