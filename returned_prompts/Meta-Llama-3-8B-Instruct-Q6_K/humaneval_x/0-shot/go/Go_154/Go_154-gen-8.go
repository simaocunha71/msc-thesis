Explanation:
The function CycpatternCheck checks if the second word (b) or any of its rotations is a substring in the first word (a). It does this by using two nested for loops to generate all possible rotations of the word b. Then it checks if any of these rotations is a substring of the word a using the strings.Contains function. If it finds a match, it returns true. If it doesn't find a match after checking all rotations, it returns false. The main function tests the CycpatternCheck function with different inputs and prints the results. 

This function has a time complexity of O(n*m), where n is the length of the first word and m is the length of the second word. This is because it checks all possible rotations of the second word, which is a nested loop with a complexity of O(m) and checks each rotation against the first word, which is a linear operation with a complexity of O(n). 

The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the input words and the rotation indices. 

This function works correctly for all the test cases provided, but it may not work correctly for very large inputs due to its high time complexity. For larger inputs, a more efficient algorithm may be needed.
