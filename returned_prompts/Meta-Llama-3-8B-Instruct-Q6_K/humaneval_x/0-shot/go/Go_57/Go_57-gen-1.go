Solution:

The provided function, `Monotonic`, checks if the elements in a given list are monotonically increasing or decreasing. Here's a breakdown of how the function works:

1.  It first checks if the list is empty. If it is, the function returns `true` because an empty list is considered monotonically increasing or decreasing.
2.  If the list is not empty, it checks if all elements are the same. If they are, the function returns `true` because a list with the same elements is monotonically increasing or decreasing.
3.  The function then checks if the list is monotonically increasing by iterating through the list and comparing each element with the previous one. If it finds an element that is less than the previous one, it sets `inc` to `false` and breaks the loop.
4.  Next, the function checks if the list is monotonically decreasing by iterating through the list and comparing each element with the previous one. If it finds an element that is greater than the previous one, it sets `dec` to `false` and breaks the loop.
5.  Finally, the function returns `true` if either `inc` or `dec` is `true`, indicating that the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing.

Here's an example of how you can use this function:

```python
print(Monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20]))  # Output: True
print(Monotonic([1, 20, 4, 10]))  # Output: False
print(Mon
