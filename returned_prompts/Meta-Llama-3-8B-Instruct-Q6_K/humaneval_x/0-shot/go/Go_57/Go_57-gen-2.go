```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func Monotonic(l []int) bool {
    increasing := true
    decreasing := true

    for i := 1; i < len(l); i++ {
        if l[i] > l[i-1] {
            decreasing = false
        }
        if l[i] < l[i-1] {
            increasing = false
        }
    }

    return increasing || decreasing
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(Monotonic([]int{1, 2, 4, 20}))  // true
    fmt.Println(Monotonic([]int{1, 20, 4, 10})) // false
    fmt.Println(Monotonic([]int{4, 1, 0, -10})) // true
}
```

The code defines a function called `Monotonic` that takes a slice of integers as an argument. It checks if the elements of the slice are either monotonically increasing or decreasing. If the list is monotonically increasing, the function returns `true`. If the list is monotonically decreasing, the function also returns `true`. If the list is neither monotonically increasing nor decreasing, the function returns `false`.

In the `Monotonic` function, two boolean variables `increasing` and `decreasing` are initialized to `true`. The function then iterates over the slice, comparing each element to its previous one. If an element is greater than its previous one, the `decreasing` variable is set to `false`. If an element is less than its previous one, the `increasing` variable is set to `false`. Finally, the function returns the logical OR of `increasing` and `decreasing`. This means that if either the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing, the function returns `true`. If the list is neither, the function returns `false`.

In the `main` function, the `Monotonic` function is called with three different slices of integers, and the results are printed to the console. The output is:

```
true
false
true
```


The `Monotonic` function correctly identifies the slices as monotonically increasing, decreasing, or neither. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `Monotonic` function with different test cases.
