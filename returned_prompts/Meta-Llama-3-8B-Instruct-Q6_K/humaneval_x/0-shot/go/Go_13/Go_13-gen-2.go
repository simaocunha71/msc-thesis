    if b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return GreatestCommonDivisor(b, a % b)

B:
    if b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return GreatestCommonDivisor(a, b % a)

C:
    if a == 0:
        return b
    else:
        return GreatestCommonDivisor(b % a, a)

D:
    if b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return GreatestCommonDivisor(a % b, b)

Solution:
The correct answer is B:
    if b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return GreatestCommonDivisor(a, b % a)

This is because the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two integers a and b is based on the idea that the greatest common divisor of a and b is the same as the greatest common divisor of b and the remainder of a divided by b. This is implemented in option B. Options A, C, and D are incorrect because they use the wrong remainder and/or swap the arguments of the recursive call. For example, option A would return the remainder of b divided by a, rather than the remainder of a divided by b. Similarly, option C would return the greatest common divisor of a and b, rather than the greatest common divisor of b and the remainder of a divided by b. Option D is incorrect because it uses the wrong remainder and swaps the arguments of the recursive call.
