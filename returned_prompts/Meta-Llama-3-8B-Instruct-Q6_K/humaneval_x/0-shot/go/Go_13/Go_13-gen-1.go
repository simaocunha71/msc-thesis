    if b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return GreatestCommonDivisor(b, a % b)

}

Solution:

The provided code is an implementation of the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. The algorithm works by recursively replacing `a` with `b` and `b` with the remainder of `a` divided by `b` until `b` becomes zero. At that point, `a` is the GCD of the original `a` and `b`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def GreatestCommonDivisor(a int, b int):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return GreatestCommonDivisor(b, a % b)
```

This function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns their GCD. The base case is when `b` is zero, in which case the GCD is `a`. Otherwise, the function calls itself with `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b` until `b` becomes zero. At that point, the function returns the GCD.
