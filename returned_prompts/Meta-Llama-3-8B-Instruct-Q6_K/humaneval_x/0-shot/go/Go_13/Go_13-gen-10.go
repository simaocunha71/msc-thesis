    if b == 0 {
        return a
    } else {
        return GreatestCommonDivisor(b, a%b)
    }
}

Answer: The code provided is a recursive function to calculate the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm. The function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns their GCD.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The function checks if `b` is 0. If it is, the GCD is `a`, so the function returns `a`.
2. If `b` is not 0, the function calls itself with the arguments `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b` (using the `%` operator). This is the recursive step, where the function reduces the problem size until it reaches the base case (when `b` is 0).
3. The function continues to call itself until `b` is 0, at which point it returns the GCD.

The Euclidean algorithm is an efficient method for finding the GCD of two integers. It works by repeatedly replacing `a` with `b` and `b` with the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, until `b` is 0. At that point, `a` is the GCD.

In this implementation, the function uses a recursive approach to calculate the GCD. The recursive call is made with the arguments `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, which effectively reduces the problem size by one step. This process continues until the base case is reached, at which point the function returns the GCD.

For example, if you call the function with `a=25` and `b=15`, the function will recursively call itself with the arguments `15` and `10`, then `10` and `5`, and finally `5` and `0`. At that point, the function returns `5`, which is the GCD of `25` and `15`.
