The function `EvenOddCount(num int)` takes an integer as input and returns a tuple (or a slice of two integers) that contains the count of even and odd digits in the input number.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the function works:

1. Initialize two variables `evenCount` and `oddCount` to 0. These variables will be used to keep track of the count of even and odd digits respectively.

2. Use a for loop to iterate over each digit of the input number. The loop continues until the input number becomes 0.

3. In each iteration of the loop, extract the last digit of the input number using the modulus operator `% 10`. This gives us the last digit of the number.

4. Check if the extracted digit is even or odd by using the modulus operator `% 2`. If the remainder is 0, the digit is even; otherwise, it's odd.

5. If the digit is even, increment the `evenCount` variable. If the digit is odd, increment the `oddCount` variable.

6. After processing each digit, divide the input number by 10 using integer division `/=`. This effectively removes the last digit from the number and moves to the next digit.

7. Once the loop finishes, return
