# This function is incorrect, as it doesn't check if the factors are prime.
# It only checks if the factor is less than the number.
# The function will return the first factor it finds, which may not be the largest prime factor.
# We need to check if the factor is prime before returning it.

# The following function checks if a number is prime:
def isPrime(num int):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Now, we can use the isPrime function to find the largest prime factor:
def LargestPrimeFactor(n int):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0 and isPrime(i):
            return i
    return n

# This function is still incorrect, as it only checks factors up to n, not n's square root.
# We need to check factors up to the square root of n, not n itself.

# The following function checks if a number is prime:
def isPrime(num int):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Now, we can use the isPrime function to find the largest prime factor:
def LargestPrimeFactor(n int):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0 and isPrime(i):
            return i
    return n

# This function should now correctly return the largest prime factor of n.
