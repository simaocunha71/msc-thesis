This function uses a combination of recursion and iteration to find the largest prime factor of a given number `n`. The base case of the recursion is when `n` is divisible by 2, in which case the function calls itself with `n` divided by 2. The iteration part of the function starts from 3 and checks if `n` is divisible by any of the numbers in the range `[3, sqrt(n)]` with a step of 2. If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, the function returns that number as the largest prime factor. If no prime factor is found, the function returns `n` itself, which is a prime number. 

The time complexity of this function is O(sqrt(n)) and the space complexity is O(log n) due to the recursive call stack. 

Note that the function assumes that `n` is greater than 1 and is not a prime number. If `n` is less than or equal to 1 or is a prime number, the function may not work correctly. 

Also, the function uses a simple trial division method to find the prime factors, which may not be efficient for large values of `n`. For large values of `n`, a more efficient method such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes or the Miller-Rabin primality test may be needed.
