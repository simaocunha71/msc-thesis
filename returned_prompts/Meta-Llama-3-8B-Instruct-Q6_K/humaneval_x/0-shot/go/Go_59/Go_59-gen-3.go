The problem is asking to find the largest prime factor of a given integer `n`. The function should assume that `n` is greater than 1 and is not a prime number.

Here is a Python solution for the problem:

```python
def largest_prime_factor(n):
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
    return n
