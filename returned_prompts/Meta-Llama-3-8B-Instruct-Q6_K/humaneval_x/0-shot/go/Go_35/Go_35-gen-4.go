// The problem description doesn't specify what to do if the input list is empty. In this case, I will return 0, but you could also choose to panic or return a specific value.
// It's also worth noting that this function will return the maximum element in the list. If you want to return the maximum element in a subset of the list, you will need to modify this function.
