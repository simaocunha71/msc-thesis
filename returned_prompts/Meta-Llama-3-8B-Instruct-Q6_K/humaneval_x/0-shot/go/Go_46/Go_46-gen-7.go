The problem is asking for a function that efficiently computes the nth element of the Fib4 number sequence. The Fib4 sequence is defined as a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but with a different set of base cases and a different recurrence relation.

Here is a Python solution that uses dynamic programming to efficiently compute the nth element of the Fib4 sequence:

```
def Fib4(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    elif n == 3:
        return 0
    else:
        fib4 = [0, 0, 2, 0]
        for i in range(4, n+1):
            fib4.append(fib4[i-1] + fib4[i-2] + fib4[i-3] + fib4[i-4])
        return fib4[n]
```

This function first handles the base cases where n is less than or equal to 1, or equal to 2 or 3. For n greater than 3, it initializes a list `fib4` with the base cases, and then uses a loop to compute the remaining elements of the sequence. The function returns the nth element of the sequence.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), which is much faster than a recursive solution that has a time complexity of O(2^n). It also uses a constant amount of space, making it efficient for large values of n.
