The problem asks to create a function that efficiently computes the nth element of the Fib4 number sequence. The Fib4 sequence is defined as follows: Fib4(0) = 0, Fib4(1) = 0, Fib4(2) = 2, Fib4(3) = 0, and for n >= 4, Fib4(n) = Fib4(n-1) + Fib4(n-2) + Fib4(n-3) + Fib4(n-4).

Here is a Python solution that uses dynamic programming to efficiently compute the nth element of the Fib4 sequence:

```python
def Fib4(n):
    if n <= 3:
        return [0, 0, 2, 0][n]
    fib4 = [0, 0, 2, 0]
    for i in range(4, n+1):
        fib4.append((fib4[i-1] + fib4[i-2] + fib4[i-3] + fib4[i-4]) % 1000000007)
    return fib4[n]
```

This function initializes a list `fib4` with the first four elements of the Fib4 sequence. Then, it iterates from 4 to `n` (inclusive), calculating each subsequent element as the sum of the previous four elements modulo 1000000007. Finally, it returns the nth element of the sequence.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), and the space complexity is O(n) as well. The function uses a constant amount of extra space to store the intermediate results, so the space complexity is linear. The time complexity is linear because the function iterates `n` times to compute the nth element of the sequence. The modulo operation is used to prevent integer overflow, as the Fib4 sequence can grow very large. The modulo operation reduces the range of the sequence, allowing the function to efficiently compute the nth element.
