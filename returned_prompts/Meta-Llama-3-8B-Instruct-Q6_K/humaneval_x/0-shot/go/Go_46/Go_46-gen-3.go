The problem is asking to implement a function that calculates the nth element of the Fib4 sequence without using recursion. The Fib4 sequence is defined as follows: Fib4(0) = 0, Fib4(1) = 0, Fib4(2) = 2, Fib4(3) = 0, and for n > 3, Fib4(n) = Fib4(n-1) + Fib4(n-2) + Fib4(n-3) + Fib4(n-4).

Here is the solution:
```go
func Fib4(n int) int {
    if n <= 3 {
        return 0
    }
    a, b, c, d := 2, 0, 0, 0
    for i := 4; i <= n; i++ {
        a, b, c, d = d, a+b+c, a, b
    }
    return d
}
```
This function uses a loop to calculate the nth element of the Fib4 sequence. It initializes four variables a, b, c, and d to store the last four elements of the sequence. For each iteration of the loop, it updates these variables to store the next four elements of the sequence. Finally, it returns the value of d, which is the nth element of the sequence.

For example, if we call Fib4(5), the function will return 4, which is the 5th element of the Fib4 sequence. Similarly, if we call Fib4(6), the function will return 8, which is the 6th element of the Fib4 sequence. If we call Fib4(7), the function will return 14, which is the 7th element of the Fib4 sequence.
