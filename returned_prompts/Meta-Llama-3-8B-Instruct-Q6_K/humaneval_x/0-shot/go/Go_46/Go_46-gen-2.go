The problem is asking you to write a function that calculates the nth element of the Fib4 sequence, which is similar to the Fibonacci sequence but with a different set of base cases and a different recurrence relation.

The base cases for the Fib4 sequence are Fib4(0) = 0, Fib4(1) = 0, Fib4(2) = 2, and Fib4(3) = 0. The recurrence relation is Fib4(n) = Fib4(n-1) + Fib4(n-2) + Fib4(n-3) + Fib4(n-4).

Here is a Python function that calculates the nth element of the Fib4 sequence using dynamic programming:

```python
def Fib4(n):
    if n <= 3:
        return [0, 0, 2, 0][n]
    fib4 = [0, 0, 2, 0]
    for i in range(4, n+1):
        fib4.append(fib4[i-1] + fib4[i-2] + fib4[i-3] + fib4[i-4])
    return fib4[n]
```

This function first checks if the input `n` is less than or equal to 3, in which case it returns the corresponding base case value. Then it initializes a list `fib4` with the base case values and calculates the next values in the sequence using the recurrence relation. Finally, it returns the `n`-th element of the list.

You can test this function with the examples you provided:

```python
print(Fib4(5))  # Output: 4
print(Fib4(6))  # Output: 8
print(Fib4(7))  # Output: 14
```

This function has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n) because it needs to store all the previous elements of the sequence. It is more efficient than a recursive function because it avoids the overhead of function calls and returns. However, it may still be slow for large values of `n` because it needs to calculate all the previous elements of the sequence. For large values of `n`, you may want to use a more efficient algorithm such as the matrix exponentiation method.
