Here is a simple and efficient solution that satisfies all the constraints and examples provided:

```go
import (
    "math"
)

func Pluck(arr []int) []int {
    minEven := math.MaxInt64
    minEvenIndex := -1
    for i, v := range arr {
        if v%2 == 0 && v < minEven {
            minEven = v
            minEvenIndex = i
        }
    }
    if minEven == math.MaxInt64 {
        return []int{}
    }
    return []int{minEven, minEvenIndex}
}
```

Explanation:
The solution iterates through the input array and keeps track of the smallest even value and its index. If the array is empty or no even values are found, it returns an empty list. Otherwise, it returns a list containing the smallest even value and its index. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the size of the input array. The space complexity is O(1), as it uses a constant amount of space to store the smallest even value and its index. This solution satisfies all the constraints and examples provided.
