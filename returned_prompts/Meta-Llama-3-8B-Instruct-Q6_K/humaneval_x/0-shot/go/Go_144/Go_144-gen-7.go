This Go function, `Simplify`, takes two string arguments, `x` and `n`, each representing a fraction in the format `<numerator>/<denominator>`. The function first converts the strings to integers using `strconv.Atoi` and then calculates the product of the numerators and denominators. It then calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator using the `GCD` function and simplifies the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by the GCD. Finally, it checks if the simplified numerator is equal to the simplified denominator, returning `true` if it is and `false` otherwise. The `GCD` function is a simple implementation of the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the GCD of two integers. It repeatedly replaces `a` with `b` and `b` with the remainder of `a` divided by `b` until `b` is zero, at which point `a` is the GCD. The function is called recursively until the remainder is zero. The GCD is then returned. The `Simplify` function is called with two string arguments, `x` and `n`, each representing a fraction in the format `<numerator>/<denominator>`.
