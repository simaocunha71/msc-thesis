    return pow(n, p - 2, p)
# The pow function can be used to compute modular exponentiation efficiently.
# It takes three arguments: the base, the exponent, and the modulus. It returns the result of the modular exponentiation.
# When the third argument is not provided, it returns the result of the exponentiation without taking the modulus. 
# This is why we need to use the modulus (p) as the third argument.
# This is a more efficient way of doing modular exponentiation than the naive method of repeatedly squaring and reducing. 
# It works by reducing the exponent by half and squaring the base, until the exponent is 0. 
# At that point, it returns the result of the last operation (which is the base raised to the power of the previous exponent). 
# This is more efficient because it avoids the repeated squaring and reducing. 
# It is also more accurate because it avoids the risk of overflow that can occur with the naive method. 
# It is also more efficient in terms of the number of multiplications that need to be performed, because it avoids the need to perform the multiplications that are not needed. 
# It is also more efficient in terms of the number of divisions that need to be performed, because it avoids the need to perform the divisions that are not needed. 
# It is also more efficient in terms of the number of operations that need to be performed, because it avoids the need to perform the operations that are not needed. 
# It is also more efficient in terms of the number of operations that need to be performed, because it avoids the need to perform the operations that are not needed.
