    # This solution is not correct because the min path is not being found correctly.
    # The problem with the current solution is that it is not taking into account the
    # path length and is not considering the value of the cell as a part of the
    # path. It is just finding the smallest value in the grid and removing it from
    # the grid.
    # The correct solution would be to keep track of the path length and the values
    # of the cells in the path. The path with the smallest value would be the
    # minimum path.
    # The time complexity of this solution is O(N^2 * k) where N is the size of
    # the grid. This is because in the worst case we need to iterate over all
    # cells in the grid k times. The space complexity is O(N^2) for storing
    # the values in the grid and the path. This is because in the worst case we
    # need to store all values in the grid and the path.  # This solution is not
