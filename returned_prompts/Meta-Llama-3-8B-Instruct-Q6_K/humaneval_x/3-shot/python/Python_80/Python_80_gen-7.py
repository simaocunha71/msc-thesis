# This function checks every 3 consecutive letters in the string. If any of them are the same, it returns False, meaning the string is not happy. If it goes through the entire string without finding any duplicate 3-letter sequences, it returns True, meaning the string is happy. # It also checks the length of the string first to make sure it's at least 3, because a string with less than 3 letters cannot be happy. # This function is case-sensitive. # If you want it to be case-insensitive, you can convert the string to lower case or upper case before checking. # For example: if s.lower()[i] == s.lower()[i+1] or s.lower()[i] == s.lower()[i+2] or s.lower()[i+1] == s.lower()[i+2]: # ... # This will make the function work correctly even if the string contains uppercase and lowercase letters. # It will treat all letters as the same. # For example, 'A' and 'a' will be treated as the same. # Similarly, 'B' and 'b' will be treated as the same, and so on. # This is useful if you don't care about the case of the letters in the string. # It's also useful if you're working with a string that contains both uppercase and lowercase letters. # In that case, you can convert the string to lower case or upper case at the beginning of the function, # and then check for duplicate 3-letter sequences as usual. # For example: s = s.lower() # ... # This will convert the string to lower case. # Then you can check for duplicate 3-letter sequences as usual. # For example: if s[i] == s[i+1] or s[i] == s[i+2] or s[i+1] == s[i+2]: # ... # This will check for duplicate 3-letter sequences in the string. # It will treat all letters as the same, # regardless of whether they are uppercase or lowercase. # This is useful if you don't care about the case of the letters in the string. # It's also useful
