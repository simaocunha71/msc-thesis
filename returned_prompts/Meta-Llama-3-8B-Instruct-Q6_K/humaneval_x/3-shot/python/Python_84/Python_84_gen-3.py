    return bin(N).count('1')  # This solution works by converting the number to binary and then counting the number of '1's in the string. The bin() function in Python returns a string that starts with '0b' and then contains the binary representation of the number. The count() function counts the number of occurrences of a substring in a string. In this case, the substring is '1'. The result is a string that starts with '0b' and then contains the binary representation of the sum of digits in binary. The result is then returned.
