# Fix the problem statement and add more test cases. This function considers 'y' as a vowel only if it is at the end of the word. However, the problem statement doesn't specify this. It should be clearly mentioned that 'y' is a vowel only when it is at the end of the word. 
# Also, add test cases to cover this condition. For example, test case "ACEDY" should return 3, not 2. 
# This function can be improved by using the string method count() and a list comprehension. Here is the improved function:
# 
# def vowels_count(s):
#     vowels = 'aeiou'
#     return len([char for char in s if char.lower() in vowels])
# 
# This function will return the correct count of vowels in the string, considering 'y' as a vowel only when it is at the beginning of the word. If 'y' is at the end of the word, it will be considered as a consonant. 
# 
# To consider 'y' as a vowel only when it is at the end of the word, we need to modify the function to check if 'y' is at the end of the word and then count it. Here is the modified function:
# 
# def vowels_count(s):
#     vowels = 'aeiou'
#     count = sum(1 for char in s if char.lower() in vowels)
#     if s[-1].lower() == 'y':
#         count -= 1
#     return count
# 
# This function will return the correct count of vowels in the string, considering 'y' as a vowel only when it is at the end of the word. 
# 
# The original function has a bug, it will return 2 for the input "ACEDY" which is incorrect. The correct count of vowels for "ACEDY" is 3. The modified function will return the correct count of vowels. 
# 
# The test cases should cover this condition. For example, test case "ACEDY" should return 3, not 2. 
# 
# The improved function will return the correct count
