# The optimized code has the same output as the original code. It is more concise and efficient. It uses list comprehension to create the result list. It also removes the is_consonant function and directly uses it in the list comprehension. This makes the code more readable and efficient.  # Added this line  # The optimized code has the same output as the original code. It is more concise and efficient.
