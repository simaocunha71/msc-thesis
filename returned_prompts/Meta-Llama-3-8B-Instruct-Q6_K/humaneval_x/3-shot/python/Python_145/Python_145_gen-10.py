    return sorted(nums, key=lambda x: (sum(map(int, str(abs(x)))), -nums.index(x)))  # Use a lambda function as the key for the sorted function. The lambda function returns a tuple for each number in the list. The first element of the tuple is the sum of the digits of the number, and the second element is the index of the number in the original list. The sorted function will sort the list first based on the sum of the digits, and then break ties by sorting based on the index. The '-' sign is used to sort in ascending order for the index, since the sorted function sorts in descending order by default.
