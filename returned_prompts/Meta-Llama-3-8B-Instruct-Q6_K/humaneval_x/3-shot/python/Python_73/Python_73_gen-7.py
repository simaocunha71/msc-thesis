    arr = arr.copy()  # Make a copy of the array to avoid modifying the original
    arr.reverse()  # Reverse the array
    changes = 0  # Initialize the number of changes

    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] != arr[len(arr) - i - 1]:  # Check if the current element is not equal to the corresponding element in the reversed array
            changes += 1  # Increment the number of changes

    return changes
# This solution works by iterating over the array and its reverse, and counting the number of elements that are not equal. This is the minimum number of changes needed to make the array palindromic. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the array. The space complexity is O(n), because we are making a copy of the array.
