    # The above line of code works by subtracting 5 from the ASCII value of each character, taking the modulus of 26 (the number of letters in the alphabet) to wrap around to the beginning of the alphabet if necessary, and then converting the result back to a character. This effectively "shifts" each character 5 positions backward in the alphabet.  The same logic is used in the encode_shift function but with addition instead of subtraction.  The result is a decoded string.  The decode_shift function is the inverse of the encode_shift function, and it can be used to reverse the encoding.  It works by subtracting 5 from the ASCII value of each character, taking the modulus of 26, and then converting the result back to a character.  This effectively shifts each character 5 positions backward in the alphabet.  The result is a decoded string.  The encoded_shift function and the decode_shift function are inverses of each other, and they can be used together to encode and decode strings.  The encode_shift function is used to encode a string, and the decode_shift function is used to decode the encoded string.  The two functions work together to shift each character in the string 5 positions forward or backward in the alphabet, depending on whether encoding or decoding is being done.  The result is a string that has been shifted 5 positions forward or backward in the alphabet.  The encode_shift function and the decode_shift function are used together to shift strings in the alphabet, and they can be used to encode and decode strings.  The encode_shift function is used to encode a string, and the decode_shift function is used to decode the encoded string.
