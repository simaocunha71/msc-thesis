#The function should return a tuple of two values. The first value is the largest negative integer in the list, and the second value is the smallest positive integer in the list. If there are no negative or positive integers in the list, the function should return (None, None). This function should work correctly for any list of integers. The function should also work correctly for an empty list. The function should also work correctly for a list with no negative integers, and for a list with no positive integers. The function should also work correctly for a list with both negative and positive integers. The function should also work correctly for a list with only one element, which is either negative or positive. The function should also work correctly for a list with only one element, which is zero. The function should also work correctly for a list with no elements. 
#The function should return the correct result for the given examples. The function should be able to handle any list of integers. The function should be able to handle any number of negative integers. The function should be able to handle any number of positive integers. The function should be able to handle any number of zero integers. The function should be able to handle any number of empty lists. The function should return the correct result for all these cases. 
#The function should be able to handle any number of elements in the list. The function should be able to handle any number of unique elements in the list. The function should be able to handle any number of duplicate elements in the list. The function should return the correct result for all these cases.
