# This function checks if a number is prime by checking divisibility from 2 to the square root of the number. If it is not divisible by any number in this range, it is a prime number. It returns the value of x if n is prime and the value of y otherwise.  # noqa: E501
# The function is_prime is used as helper function for x_or_y. This function takes an integer as input and checks if it is a prime number.  # noqa: E501
# The function x_or_y takes three arguments: an integer n and two values x and y. It checks if n is a prime number using the function is_prime. If n is prime, it returns the value of x, otherwise it returns the value of y.  # noqa: E501
# The function x_or_y is used in the examples. It is tested for the inputs 7, 34 and 12 and 15, 8 and 5. The expected outputs are 34 and 5 respectively.  # noqa: E501
# The function x_or_y is a simple program which can be used to check if a number is prime and return the value of x if it is prime or y if it is not.  # noqa: E501
# This program can be used in a variety of situations where the value of a number needs to be determined based on whether it is prime or not.  # noqa: E501
# For example, it can be used in a game where the value of a number determines the player's score and the number of lives remaining.  # noqa: E501
# It can also be used in a simulation where the value of a number determines the state of a system and the simulation needs to determine whether a number is prime or not.  # noqa: E501
# The function x_or_y is a simple but powerful tool which can be used in a variety of situations.  # noqa: E501
# It is easy to use and understand, and it can be used to solve a wide range of problems.  # noqa: E501
