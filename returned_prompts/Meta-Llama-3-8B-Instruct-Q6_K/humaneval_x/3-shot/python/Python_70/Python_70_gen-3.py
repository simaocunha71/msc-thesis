# This solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting, where n is the number of elements in the list. It is the most efficient solution as it uses the built-in sorting function which has a time complexity of O(n log n). The space complexity is O(n) for the result list. The solution works by first sorting the list in ascending order. Then, it iterates over the sorted list, adding the current element to the result list and then moving to the next element. If the current element is the last element in the list, it moves to the first element. This process continues until the list is empty. The result list is then returned. The time complexity is O(n log n) and the space complexity is O(n).  # noqa: E501
