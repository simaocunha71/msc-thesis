}  // This is the recursive version of the Euclidean algorithm. The iterative version is also possible.  The base case is when the second number is 0, in which case the GCD is the first number. Otherwise, we recursively call the function with the second number and the remainder of the division of the first number by the second number. This effectively reduces the problem size until the base case is reached.  The GCD of the original numbers is then the GCD of the last two numbers in the sequence.  This function will work correctly for any two integers a and b.  If a and b are not integers, the function will not work correctly.  If you want to extend the function to work with non-integer numbers, you would need to modify the function to use a different method of finding the GCD, such as the GCD function from the math package in Go.  The time complexity of this function is O(log min(a,b)), where min(a,b) is the smaller of a and b.  This is because each recursive call reduces the problem size by at least one, and the base case is reached when the problem size is reduced to 0.  The space complexity is O(log min(a,b)) as well, because each recursive call adds a new layer to the call stack, and the base case is reached when the call stack is empty.  This means that the function will work correctly for any two integers a and b, and the time and space complexity are reasonable.  However, if the numbers are very large, the function may run out of stack space or exceed the maximum recursion depth.  In that case, you would need to use an iterative version of the function, which would have the same time complexity but a space complexity of O(1), because it does not use a recursive call stack.  The iterative version of the function would look something like this:  for b != 0 {   a, b = b, a%b  }  return a  This function would work correctly for any two integers a and b, and it would not exceed the maximum recursion depth.  However, it would not be as readable or as easy to understand as the recursive version.  It is generally a good idea to use the recursive version of a function when the problem size is small and the function is easy to understand,
