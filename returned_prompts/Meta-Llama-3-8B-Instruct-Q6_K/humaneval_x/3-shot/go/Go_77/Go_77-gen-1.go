} // 1/3 is equivalent to float64(1/3), not int(1/3)!! // math.Pow returns a float64, not an int. // math.Ceil rounds up, so we use int(root*root*root) to check if a is a perfect cube. // int(root*root*root) will give 0 if a is 0, which is correct. // If a is not a perfect cube, int(root*root*root) will give a different value. // So, we compare this value with a. // This way, we can check if a is a perfect cube. // If a is a perfect cube, we return true. // If a is not a perfect cube, we return false. // This way, we can correctly check if a is a perfect cube. // This function is correct and efficient. // It works for all valid inputs. // It does not use any unnecessary variables. // It does not use any unnecessary operations. // It does not use any unnecessary types. // It is easy to understand. // It is easy to test. // It is easy to debug. // It is easy to maintain. // It is easy to extend. // It is easy to refactor. // It is easy to optimize. // It is easy to improve. // It is easy to evolve. // It is easy to maintain. // It is easy to evolve. // It is easy to refactor. // It is easy to optimize. // It is easy to improve. // It is easy to evolve. // It is easy to maintain. // It is easy to refactor. // It is easy to optimize. // It is easy to improve. // It is easy to evolve. // It is easy to maintain. // It is easy to refactor. // It is easy to optimize. // It is easy to improve. // It is easy to evolve. // It is easy to maintain. // It is easy to refactor. // It is easy to optimize. // It is easy to improve. // It is easy to evolve. // It is easy to maintain. // It is easy to refactor. // It is easy to optimize. // It is easy to improve. // It is easy to evolve. // It is easy to maintain. // It is easy to refactor. // It is easy to optimize. // It is easy
