A more efficient solution would be to use a slice of pointers to integers and modify the original list. But the problem description does not allow this.  // The time complexity is O(n log n) due to the sort operation. The space complexity is O(n) for the result array.  // This problem is a good example of how the problem description can affect the solution. If the problem allowed modifying the original list, a more efficient solution would be possible.  // This problem is also a good example of how the problem description can affect the time and space complexity of the solution.  // The problem description does not allow the use of a slice of pointers to integers. This means that the solution must create a new array and copy the elements.

This means that the solution must use the sort function with a slice of integers and then copy the elements to the result array.
