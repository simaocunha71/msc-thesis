}  // Corrected code
// The function Bf takes two planet names as strings planet1 and planet2.
// It returns a tuple containing all planets whose orbits are located between the orbit of planet1 and the orbit of planet2, sorted by the proximity to the sun.
// The function returns an empty tuple if planet1 or planet2 are not correct planet names.
// The function also checks if planet1 is to the right of planet2 in the list, and if so, it swaps them.
// It then returns a slice of the planets list from planet_index1 + 1 to planet_index2.
// The Bf function works by first finding the indices of planet1 and planet2 in the planets list.
// If either planet1 or planet2 is not found in the list, it returns an empty slice.
// Then it checks if planet1 is to the right of planet2 and if so, it swaps them.
// Finally, it returns a slice of the planets list from planet_index1 + 1 to planet_index2.
// This slice contains all the planets whose orbits are located between the orbit of planet1 and the orbit of planet2, sorted by the proximity to the sun.
