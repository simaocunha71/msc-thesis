}  // Sort the result if you want the output to be in ascending order. But since the problem statement doesn't specify the order, the result will be in ascending order by default.  If you want it in descending order, you can use the sort function from the sort package in Go.  Here is the code to sort the result in descending order: 
    // sort.IntsDesc(result)  // This line should be added at the end of the function.  But again, the problem statement doesn't specify the order, so the result will be in ascending order by default.  If you want it in descending order, you need to specify it in the problem statement.  If you want to keep the original order, you can skip this step.  If you want to sort it in ascending order, you can use sort.Ints(result).  If you want to sort it in descending order, you can use sort.IntsDesc(result).  The sort function from the sort package in Go can be used to sort slices of integers.  The sort.Ints function can be used to sort a slice of integers in ascending order, and the sort.IntsDesc function can be used to sort a slice of integers in descending order.  Here is the code to sort the result in ascending order: 
    // sort.Ints(result)  // This line should be added at the end of the function.  But again, the problem statement doesn't specify the order, so the result will be in ascending order by default.
