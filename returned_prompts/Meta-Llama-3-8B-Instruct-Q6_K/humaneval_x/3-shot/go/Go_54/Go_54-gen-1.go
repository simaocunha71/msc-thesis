}  // same number of each character in both strings.  The function will return false for any strings that do not meet these conditions.  It does this by comparing the length of the strings and then iterating over each character in the first string.  It counts the occurrences of each character in both strings and if it finds a character that is not present in the same number in both strings, it returns false.  If it checks all characters and they are present in the same number in both strings, it returns true.  This ensures that the two strings have the same characters.
