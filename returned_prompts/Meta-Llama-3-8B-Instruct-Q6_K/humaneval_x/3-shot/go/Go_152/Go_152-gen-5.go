    result := make([]int, len(game))
    for i:=0; i < len(game); i++ {
        result[i] = int(math.Abs(float64(guess[i] - game[i])))
    }
    return result
}  // Corrected version of the code. The initial version had a bug where it was trying to use math.Abs with int.  This is corrected by converting the int to float64 before calling math.Abs.  This is a standard idiom in Go for working with floating point numbers and integers.  The result is then converted back to an int before being assigned to the result array.  This ensures that the result is always an integer, even if the result of the calculation is a non-integer value.  This is important because the problem statement specifies that the result should be an array of integers.
