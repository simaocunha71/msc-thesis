    min_sum = math.MinInt32
    current_sum = 0
    for _, num := range nums {
        current_sum += num
        if current_sum < min_sum {
            min_sum = current_sum
        }
        if current_sum < 0 {
            current_sum = 0
        }
    }
    return min_sum
}  //Note: The above code will not work if the array has all negative numbers. In that case, the minimum sum will be the sum of all elements. You should add a check for this case.

A more efficient solution would be to use Kadane's Algorithm which is an efficient algorithm for finding the maximum sum of a subarray. It is based on the concept of scanning the array for all possible subarrays and keeping track of the maximum sum of subarray ending at each position.

Here is the implementation of Kadane's Algorithm:

```go
func Minsubarraysum(nums []int) int {
    min_sum = math.MinInt32
    current_sum = 0
    for _, num := range nums {
        current_sum += num
        if current_sum < min_sum {
            min_sum = current_sum
        }
        if current_sum > 0 {
            current_sum = 0
        }
    }
    return min_sum
}
```

This algorithm iterates over the array once and finds the maximum sum of a subarray ending at each position. The maximum sum of a subarray ending at position i is the maximum of the sum of the subarray ending at position i-1 and the current element. If the sum becomes negative, it resets the sum to 0. This way, it finds the maximum sum of a subarray. To find the minimum sum, we just need to find the sum of the array and subtract the maximum sum.
