}  // This function uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. When a closing bracket is encountered, it checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it returns false, indicating that there is no valid subsequence of brackets. If the stack is not empty, it removes the top element from the stack. At the end of the function, it checks if the stack is not empty. If it is not empty, it returns true, indicating that there is a valid subsequence of brackets. If the stack is empty, it returns false, indicating that there is no valid subsequence of brackets.
