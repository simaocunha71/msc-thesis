    return (a % 10) * (b % 10)
}  // This code multiplies the last digit of the numbers a and b. The last digit of a number is given by the modulus operator % with 10 as the divisor. The result is then returned as an integer.  This code assumes that the input is always valid, i.e., the numbers are integers.  It doesn't account for negative numbers, though.  For negative numbers, the modulus operation will return a negative number, which might not be the desired result.  To handle this, we could add a line to take the absolute value of the result before returning it.  Here's the updated code:  func Multiply(a, b int) int { return abs((a % 10) * (b % 10)) }  The function abs() is not included in the standard library, so we would have to define it ourselves.  Here's a simple definition:  func abs(x int) int { if x < 0 { return -x } else { return x } }  With this updated code, we can handle negative numbers correctly.
