    i := n / 2
    for i > 1 {
        if n % i == 0 {
            return LargestPrimeFactor(i)
        }
        i -= 1
    }
    return n
}  // This is a very inefficient solution. For larger inputs, it will be much slower than a more efficient algorithm.

A more efficient algorithm would be to start from the largest possible prime factor and check if it divides the number. If it does, then it's the largest prime factor. Otherwise, you can divide the number by the largest possible prime factor and repeat the process.

Here is the more efficient algorithm:
```
func LargestPrimeFactor(n int) int {
    i := int(math.Sqrt(float64(n)))
    for i >= 2 {
        if n % i == 0 {
            return LargestPrimeFactor(i)
        }
        i -= 1
    }
    return n
}
```
This algorithm has a time complexity of O(sqrt(n)), which is much faster than the previous algorithm for larger inputs.
