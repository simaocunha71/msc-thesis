}  // This function checks if a number is prime by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number and checking if the number is divisible by any of the numbers in that range. If it is, then the number is not a prime number. If the number is not divisible by any of the numbers in that range, then the number is a prime number. This function uses this logic to check if the length of the string is a prime number.
