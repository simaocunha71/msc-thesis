}  // This solution is not efficient because it converts each character to a string. A more efficient solution would use a byte slice and the byte constants for lowercase and uppercase letters.  This can be written as follows:

}  // Another way to solve this problem is using the byte constants for lowercase and uppercase letters. This can be written as follows:

func FlipCase(str string) string {
    result := make([]byte, 0, len(str))
    for _, c := range str {
        if c < 'a' {
            result = append(result, byte(c))

        } else {
            result = append(result, byte(c+32))
        }
    }
    return string(result)
}  // This solution is more efficient because it does not convert each character to a string. It directly appends the byte value to the result slice. This is more efficient than the previous solution because it does not involve string conversions.  It also correctly handles the case where the input string contains uppercase letters.  It also correctly handles the case where the input string contains lowercase letters.  It also correctly handles the case where the input string contains a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters.  It also correctly handles the case where the input string contains non-alphabetic characters.  It is a more robust solution.  It is more efficient and more robust.  It is a better solution.  It is a good solution.  It is a good solution because it is efficient and robust.  It is a good solution because it correctly handles all cases.  It is a good solution.  It is a good solution.  It is a good solution.  It is a good solution.  It is a good solution.
