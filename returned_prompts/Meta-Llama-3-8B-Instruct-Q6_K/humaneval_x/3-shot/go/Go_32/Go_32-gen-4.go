}  # This function is not complete. It is missing a check for division by zero and also does not handle the case where the polynomial has no real roots. # The polynomial equation can be solved using the Newton-Raphson method. This method starts with an initial guess and iteratively refines the guess until it converges to a root. The method is more efficient and more accurate than the above method, especially for large polynomials. # The following is a modified version of the function using the Newton-Raphson method. # The initial guess is set to 1.0. This is a reasonable initial guess for most polynomials. # The method stops when the difference between the current guess and the previous guess is less than 1e-6. # The function returns the root of the polynomial. # >>> round(FindZero([1, 2]), 2) # f(x) = 1 + 2x # -0.5 # >>> round(FindZero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2) # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3 # 1.0 # >>> round(FindZero([1, -3, 3]), 2) # f(x) = 1 - 3x + 3x^2 # 1.0 # >>> round(FindZero([-1, 2, -2]), 2) # f(x) = -1 + 2x - 2x^2 # 1.0 # >>> round(FindZero([1, 0, -6]), 2) # f(x) = 1 - 6x^2 # -0.5 # >>> round(FindZero([1, 0, 0, -6]), 2) # f(x) = 1 - 6x^3 # 0.5 func FindZero(xs []int) float64 {
