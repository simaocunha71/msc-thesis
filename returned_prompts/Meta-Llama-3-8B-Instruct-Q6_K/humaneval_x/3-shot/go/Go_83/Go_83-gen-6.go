}  // 9 because last digit can be any number from 1 to 9. But 0 is not included as per problem statement.  // (n-1) * (10^(n-1) - 1) because all other numbers are included in it.  // 0 is not included because it is not 1.  // So all the numbers that start or end with 1 are counted.  // Time Complexity: O(1)  // Space Complexity: O(1)  // This solution is based on the concept of number of ways to choose a digit for each place, and how many numbers are available for each place.  // The idea is to fix the first digit as 1 and then count the number of ways to fill the remaining (n-1) places.  // For the last place, it can be any number from 1 to 9.  // The rest (n-1) places can be any number from 0 to 9, so there are 10 options for each place.  // So the total number of ways to fill the remaining (n-1) places is 10^(n-1).  // Since we fixed the first digit as 1, we need to subtract 1 from the total count to avoid counting the numbers that start with 0.  // This is because the problem statement does not include numbers that start with 0.  // So the total count is (10^(n-1) - 1).  // For the numbers that end with 1, we need to count the numbers that have n digits and the last digit is 1.  // There are 9 options for the last digit (from 1 to 9), and for the rest (n-1) places, there are 10 options for each place.  // So the total number of ways to fill the remaining (n-1) places is 10^(n-1).  // Since we fixed the last digit as 1, we need to multiply the total count by 9 to get the total count of numbers that end with 1.  // The total count is (n-1) * (10^(n-1) - 1) + 9.  // This is because the problem statement includes the numbers that start or end with 1.
