    return strings.Split(s, " ")
}
// Note: The problem statement is not clear, it seems like it is asking to split the string into words
// but it does not specify what to use as a delimiter. But based on the examples given, it seems like
// the delimiter is a space, so the solution is to use the strings.Split function with a space as the
// delimiter. However, if the problem statement is asking to split the string into words using both
// commas and spaces, then the solution would be to use a regular expression to split the string.
