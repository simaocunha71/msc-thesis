  return Math.max(...l);
} // This is the most efficient way to find the maximum element in an array
// It uses the spread operator to pass the array to Math.max() which can handle arrays
// It returns the maximum value in the array
} // You can also use a loop to find the maximum element, but it is less efficient
// for large arrays
// let max = l[0];
// for (let i = 1; i < l.length; i++) {
//   if (l[i] > max) {
//     max = l[i];

} // This method is less efficient but it can be used if you don't know about the spread operator
// It is also less readable and less maintainable
// It is generally a good idea to use the most efficient method that you know
// In this case, the most efficient method is the spread operator method
// You should use that method unless you have a specific reason not to
// The reason for using the most efficient method is that it is generally the best practice
// It is also the most maintainable and the most readable
