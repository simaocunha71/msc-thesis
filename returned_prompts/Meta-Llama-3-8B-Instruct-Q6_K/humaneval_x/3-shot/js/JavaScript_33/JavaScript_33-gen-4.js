}  // This function works by using the map function to create a new list
// The map function applies a provided function to each element of the list
// and returns a new list with the results
// The provided function checks if the index i is divisible by 3
// If it is, it returns the smallest element from the slice of the list starting from i
// If it's not, it just returns the element at index i
// The result is a list where the elements at the indices that are divisible by 3 are sorted
// and the rest are the same as the original list
// The time complexity of this function is O(n log n) due to the sort operation
// where n is the length of the list
// The space complexity is O(n) for the new list
// This is because the space required to store the new list is equal to the space required to store the original list
// The function does not modify the original list
// It returns a new list
// This is because the original list is not modified
// It is not possible to achieve this without creating a new list
// This is because the original list is not a reference to the new list
// The new list is a separate object in memory
// The function does not return the original list
// It returns a new list
// This is because the function is supposed to return a new list
