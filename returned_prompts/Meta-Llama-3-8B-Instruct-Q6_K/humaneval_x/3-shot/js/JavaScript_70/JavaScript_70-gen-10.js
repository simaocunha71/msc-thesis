Here is the breakdown of the solutions:

1. `hasCloseElements`: This function takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input. It checks if there are any two numbers in the list that are closer to each other than the given threshold. If it finds such a pair, it returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

2. `separateParenGroups`: This function takes a string of parentheses as input and returns a list of separate groups of parentheses. It iterates through the input string, keeping track of the current group and its depth. When it encounters a closing parenthesis, it checks if the current group is complete (i.e., its depth is 0). If it is, it adds the current group to the result list and resets the current group.

3. `truncateNumber`: This function takes a floating-point number as input and returns its decimal part. It uses the modulo operator to get the remainder of the division of the number by 1.0, which is the decimal part.

4. `strangeSortList`: This function takes a list of integers as input and returns it in a strange order. It first finds the minimum and maximum values in the list, then repeatedly selects the minimum value from the remaining list, adds it to the result list, and removes it from the remaining list. Then, it selects the maximum value from the remaining list, adds it to the result list, and removes it from the remaining list. This process is repeated until the remaining list is empty.
