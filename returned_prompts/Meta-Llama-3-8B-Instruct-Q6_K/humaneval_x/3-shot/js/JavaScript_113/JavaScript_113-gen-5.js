}  //This function takes a list of strings as an argument, iterates over each string, counts the number of odd digits in each string, and returns a list of strings describing the count of odd digits in each string. The strings are formatted with the index of the string and the count of odd digits. The 'n' is used to replace the actual number of odd digits.  //The output of this function will be a list of strings. Each string describes the count of odd digits in the corresponding string of the input list.  //This function could be more efficient if the actual number of odd digits was used instead of 'n'. But the problem statement requires that the number of odd digits should be replaced by 'n'.  //The time complexity of this function is O(n*m) where n is the number of strings in the input list and m is the length of the longest string in the input list. The space complexity is O(n) where n is the number of strings in the input list.  //This function can be used to count the number of odd digits in each string of a list of strings. It can be used in a situation where you need to count the number of odd digits in each string of a list of strings and return a list of strings describing the count of odd digits in each string.  //This function can be modified to count the number of even digits in each string of a list of strings by changing the condition in the filter function from c % 2 !== 0 to c % 2 === 0.  //This function can be modified to count the number of digits in each string of a list of strings by removing the filter function.  //This function can be used to count the number of digits in each string of a list of strings. It can be used in a situation where you need to count the number of digits in each string of a list of strings and return a list of strings describing the count of digits in each string.  //This function can be modified to count the number of characters in each string of a list of strings by removing the split and filter functions.  //This function can be used to count the number of characters in each string of
