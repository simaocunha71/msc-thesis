// filter() returns a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
// It's used here to count the odd digits in the string.
// The map() method creates a new array with the results of the provided function.
// The provided function is called with the current element as an argument. In this case, the function is a string formatted string. 
// The formatted string contains the number of odd digits in the string, the string itself, and the index of the string in the list. 
// The result is an array of strings where each string represents the number of odd digits in the corresponding string in the input list. 
// The numbers in the output strings are replaced with their corresponding values.
