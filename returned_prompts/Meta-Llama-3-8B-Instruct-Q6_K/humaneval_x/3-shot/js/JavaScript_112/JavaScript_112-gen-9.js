} // This function first filters out the characters in string s that are present in string c, then checks if the resulting string is a palindrome. It returns a tuple containing the result string and a boolean indicating whether the result string is a palindrome. The result string is the string s with all characters equal to any character in c removed, and the palindrome check is done by comparing the string with its reverse. If the string is the same as its reverse, it is a palindrome.
