  return (a * h) / 2;
}  //This is the formula for the area of a triangle with base a and height h.  It returns the area as a float.  The area of a triangle is (base * height) / 2.  In this case, the base is the length of the side (a) and the height is the height of the triangle (h).  The area is then returned as a float.  If you want to round the result to the nearest integer, you can use the Math.round() function.  For example: return Math.round((a * h) / 2).  This will round the area to the nearest integer.  If you want to round to a specific number of decimal places, you can use the toFixed() function.  For example: return (a * h) / 2).toFixed(2).  This will round the area to 2 decimal places.  If you don't specify the number of decimal places, the toFixed() function will default to 0 decimal places.  For example: return (a * h) / 2).toFixed().  This will round the area to 0 decimal places, effectively converting it to an integer.  If you want to round the area to the nearest integer, you can use the Math.round() function.  For example: return Math.round((a * h) / 2).  This will round the area to the nearest integer.  If you want to round the area to a specific number of decimal places, you can use the toFixed() function.  For example: return (a * h) / 2).toFixed(2).  This will round the area to 2 decimal places.
