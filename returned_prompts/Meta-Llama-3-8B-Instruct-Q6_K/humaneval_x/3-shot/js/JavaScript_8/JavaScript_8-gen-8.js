  let sum = 0;
  let product = 1;
  for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    sum += numbers[i];
    product *= numbers[i];
  }
  return [sum, product];
} // The code seems to be missing the return statement. It seems like there's an extra parameter 'int' which is not being used. Based on the problem statement, I assume that the function should only take one parameter which is the list of numbers. The function should return a tuple with the sum and product of the numbers. If the list is empty, the sum should be 0 and the product should be 1. Here is the corrected code.
