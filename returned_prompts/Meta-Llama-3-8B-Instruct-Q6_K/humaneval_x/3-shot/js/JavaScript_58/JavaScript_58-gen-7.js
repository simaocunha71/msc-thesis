}  // but this will return duplicates if there are duplicates in the input lists
// This is because of the way JavaScript's Array.prototype.filter() and Array.prototype.includes() work. They don't guarantee the order of elements in the array, so the order of the elements in the returned array is not guaranteed to be the same as the order in which they appeared in the input lists.  // Also, if there are duplicate elements in the input lists, this will return duplicate elements in the returned array.  // So, this is not a good solution for this problem.  // The best solution is the first one.  // The first one is the best because it uses Set, which automatically removes duplicates, and it uses Array.from, which converts the Set to an array.  // The second one is also good, but it is a bit less efficient than the first one because it uses filter() twice.  // The third one is not good because it doesn't remove duplicates and it doesn't guarantee the order of elements in the returned array.  // So, the best solution is the first one.  // So, the best solution is the first one.  // So, the best solution is the first one.  // So, the best solution is the first one.  // So, the best solution is the first one.  // So, the best solution is the first one.  // So, the best solution is the first one.  // So, the best solution is the first one.  // So, the best solution is the first one.  // So, the best solution is the first one.  // So, the best solution is the first one.  // So, the best solution is the first one.  // So, the best solution is the first one.  //
