  if (txt.length === 0) return false;

} // Code explanation: 
// The regular expression `/^[a-zA-Z]$/.test(lastChar)` checks if the last character is an alphabetical character.
// The regular expression `!/^\w+$/.test(txt)` checks if the last character is not part of a word. The `\w` character class matches alphanumeric characters and underscores. The `^` and `$` anchors ensure that we are checking the start and end of the string respectively. If the last character is part of a word, this expression will return `true`, so we use the `!` operator to negate the result. 
// If the last character is not an alphabetical character or is part of a word, the function returns `false`. If the last character is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, the function returns `true`.
