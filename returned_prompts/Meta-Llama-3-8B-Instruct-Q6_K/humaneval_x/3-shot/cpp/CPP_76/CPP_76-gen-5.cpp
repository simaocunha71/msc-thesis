} // This function checks if x is a simple power of n by calculating the logarithm of x with base n and checking if it's an integer. If it is, then x is a simple power of n. Otherwise, it's not. This is because the logarithm of a simple power is always an integer. For example, the logarithm of 2^3 is 3, the logarithm of 4^1 is 1, etc. The round function is used to round the result of the logarithm to the nearest integer, and then we check if the result is equal to the original logarithm. If it is, then the logarithm was an integer, and x is a simple power of n. If not, then it's not. This function is more accurate than the one that uses the pow function, because the pow function can lose precision for large values of x and n. The logarithm function, on the other hand, is more precise and can handle large values without losing precision.
