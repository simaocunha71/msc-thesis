The given code is a solution to the problems mentioned above in C++. Here's a brief explanation of each function:

1. `has_close_elements`:
   This function checks if there are any two numbers in the given vector of numbers that are closer to each other than the given threshold. It iterates over the vector and checks the absolute difference between each pair of numbers. If it finds a pair with a difference less than the threshold, it returns `true`. If it doesn't find any such pair, it returns `false`.

2. `separate_paren_groups`:
   This function takes a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses as input and returns a vector of strings, each representing a separate group of parentheses. It iterates over the input string, keeping track of the current group of parentheses and the level of nesting. When it encounters a closing parenthesis, it checks if the level of nesting is zero, which means it has found a complete group of parentheses. If so, it adds the current group to the result vector and resets the current group.

3. `truncate_number`:
   This function takes a positive floating-point number as input and returns its decimal part. It does this by subtracting the integer part of the number from the original number.

4. `compare`:
   This function takes two vectors of scores and guesses as input and returns a vector of the same length, denoting how far off each guess was. If the guess is correct, the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score. It iterates over the input vectors and checks each guess against the corresponding score. If the guess is correct, it adds 0 to the result vector; otherwise, it adds the absolute difference.
