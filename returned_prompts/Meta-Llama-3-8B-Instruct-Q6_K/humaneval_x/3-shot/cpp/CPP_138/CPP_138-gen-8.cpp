} // This code will not work for all numbers. The sum of four positive even numbers can be written in the form: 2*(a+b+c+d)=n where a, b, c, d are positive integers. This code will not work for all numbers, because it is not considering all the possible combinations of a, b, c, d.
// A correct solution would be to generate all possible combinations of four positive even numbers and check if their sum equals to the given number. This can be done using recursion or backtracking. But the above code is not doing that, it is just checking if a number is divisible by 2*(i+2)*(i+4)*(i+6) which is not the correct way to solve this problem. 
// For example, for n=8, the numbers are 2,2,2,2, and for n=10, the numbers are 2,2,2,4, but the above code will not find these combinations. 
// So the above code is not correct and should not be used.
