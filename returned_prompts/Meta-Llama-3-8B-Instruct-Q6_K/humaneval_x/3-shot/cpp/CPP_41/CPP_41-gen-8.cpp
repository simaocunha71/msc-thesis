    int collisions=0;
    for (int i=0;i<n;i++)
    for (int j=0;j<n;j++)
    if (i!=j)
    if (i+j==n-1)
    collisions+=1;
    return collisions;
} // Not correct implementation. The function does not correctly calculate the collisions.

Note: This problem is a bit more complex and requires a different approach. A simple nested loop is not enough to solve it. It is recommended to use a different approach like using the concept of modulo operation to solve this problem. The correct solution is given below:

```c
#include<stdio.h>
using namespace std;
int car_race_collision(int n){
    int collisions=0;
    for (int i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        collisions+=n-i-1;
    }
    return collisions;
}
```
This function works by calculating the number of cars that can collide with each car. Each car can collide with n-i-1 cars, where i is the current car. The total number of collisions is the sum of the collisions for each car. This is why the function calculates n-i-1 for each car and adds it to the total number of collisions. The function then returns the total number of collisions. This solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1). It is a more efficient and correct solution to the problem.
