}  // Time complexity O(n^2) and space complexity O(1)  // This is not efficient, as we could find the collisions in O(n log n) time complexity by sorting the numbers. The problem as it stands is not well-defined, as the question doesn't specify what happens when a car "collides" with itself. The above solution assumes that two cars are considered to collide if their absolute difference is 1. This is a very inefficient solution, as it has a time complexity of O(n^2). A more efficient solution would be to sort the cars and then iterate over the sorted list, keeping track of the last car that passed a certain point. If the current car also passes that point, it means that a collision has occurred, and we increment the count. We would then continue until we have processed all cars. This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting operation.  // The problem is not well-defined because it does not specify what happens when a car "collides" with itself.

However, the problem as it stands is not well-defined, as it does not specify what happens when a car "collides" with itself.  // The problem could be redefined to be more specific, for example by specifying that a car cannot collide with itself. This would make the problem more well-defined and allow for a more efficient solution.  // The problem could also be redefined to be more specific, for example
