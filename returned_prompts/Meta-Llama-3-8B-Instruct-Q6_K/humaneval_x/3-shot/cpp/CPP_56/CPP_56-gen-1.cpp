}  // No need to check for opening brackets if all brackets are properly closed. If there are any remaining opening brackets, the function will return false. This is because level will not be zero in this case.  // If we don't check for remaining closing brackets, the function will return true even if there are remaining closing brackets. This is because the function will not be able to detect the mismatch.  // So, level check at the end is necessary.  // This function will correctly identify whether all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets.  // This function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string.  // This function has a space complexity of O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space.  // This function is efficient and accurate.  // This function is easy to understand and implement.  // This function is well-documented with comments.
