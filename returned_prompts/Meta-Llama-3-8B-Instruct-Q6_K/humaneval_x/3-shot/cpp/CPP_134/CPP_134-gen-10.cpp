This code checks if the last character of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word. A "word" is defined as a group of characters separated by a space. The function returns `true` if the last character meets the condition and `false` otherwise.

Here's a breakdown of how the function works:

1. It first checks if the input string is empty. If it is, the function returns `false`.
2. It then checks if the last character of the string is an alphabetical character (either lowercase or uppercase).
3. If the last character is an alphabetical character, the function checks if it is not part of a word. It does this by checking if the last space character is at the end of the string or not. If there is no space character at the end of the string, it means the last character is not part of a word.
4. If the last character is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

The provided examples illustrate how the function works:

* `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pie")` returns `false` because the last character is not an alphabetical character.
* `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e")` returns `true` because the last character is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word.
* `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e ")` returns `false` because the last character is an alphabetical character, but it is part of a word (the word "e").
* `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("")` returns `false` because the input string is empty.
