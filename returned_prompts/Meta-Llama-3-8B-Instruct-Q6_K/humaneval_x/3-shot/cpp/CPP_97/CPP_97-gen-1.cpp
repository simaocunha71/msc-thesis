}  // Note: The original problem was asking for the product of the unit digits, which is what this function returns. However, it seems that the function should return the product of the entire numbers. In that case, the function would be: int multiply(int a,int b){ return a*b; }  // Corrected function.  // The above function is correct if you want the product of the entire numbers.
