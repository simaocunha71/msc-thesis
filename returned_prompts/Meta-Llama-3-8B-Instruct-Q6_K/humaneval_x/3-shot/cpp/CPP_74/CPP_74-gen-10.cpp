}  //This solution has time complexity of O(N*M), where N is the size of the vector and M is the maximum length of the string in the vector.  It can be optimized by calculating the total character count in each vector once.  Also, it will return the first vector if the two vectors have the same number of chars.  It doesn't handle the case where the input vectors are empty.  It doesn't handle the case where the input vectors contain empty strings.  It can be optimized further by using a single loop to calculate the total character count for each vector, and then comparing the counts.  It can be further optimized by using the `size` method to get the total character count for each vector, and then comparing the counts.
