    vector<int> result;
    for (boost::any val : values)
    {
        if (boost::any_cast<int>(val))
        {
            result.push_back(boost::any_cast<int>(val));
        }
    }
    return result;
}  // This code does not compile. It seems that you are using C++ and Boost. The problem is that you are using Python values in a C++ program, which is not possible. Python values are Python objects and are not compatible with C++. If you are trying to filter a list of Python values that have been converted to C++ objects, then you need to modify your code to handle the conversion correctly. If you are trying to filter a list of C++ objects that have a similar interface to Python values, then you need to modify your code to correctly handle the objects. The following example assumes that you are trying to filter a list of C++ objects that have a similar interface to Python values, and it uses the `boost::any` class to handle the objects. The code is not tested and may not work correctly. It is provided as a starting point for you to modify and test. 

This code should work correctly if your `list_any` contains only integers, strings, and empty lists. If your `list_any` contains other types of objects, you need to add more code to handle those objects correctly. 

The following code uses `boost::any_cast` to convert the `boost::any` objects to `int` objects. If the `boost::any` object cannot be converted to an `int` object, `boost::any_cast` will throw a `boost::bad_any_cast` exception. You may want to add error handling code to handle this exception.

Here is an example of how to use this code:

```cpp
int main() {
    list_any values = {1, 2, 3, "abc", {}, {}};
    vector<int> result = filter_integers(values);
    for (int val : result) {
        cout << val << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
