This code snippet provides the implementation of five different functions in C++.

1.  **has_close_elements**: This function checks if there are any two numbers in a given vector of numbers that are closer to each other than a specified threshold.
2.  **separate_paren_groups**: This function takes a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses and separates them into separate strings, returning a vector of those.
3.  **truncate_number**: This function takes a positive floating-point number and returns its decimal part.
4.  **below_threshold**: This function checks if all numbers in a given vector are below a specified threshold.

Each function is implemented with a clear and concise algorithm, and the code is well-structured and easy to read. The functions are also tested with sample inputs to demonstrate their functionality.
