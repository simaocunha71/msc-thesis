}  // Correct bracketing if and only if the level of the brackets is 0 at the end.  If the level of the brackets is not zero at the end, then it means there are brackets which do not have a corresponding closing bracket.  // A counter is used to keep track of the level of the brackets.  It is incremented when an opening bracket is encountered and decremented when a closing bracket is encountered.  If at any point the level becomes negative, it means there are more closing brackets than opening brackets, so the function returns false.  At the end, if the level is zero, it means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so the function returns true.  If the level is not zero, it means there are brackets which do not have a corresponding closing bracket, so the function returns false.  // This function works correctly for all valid inputs.  // It returns false for invalid inputs such as a string with an odd number of brackets or a string with a closing bracket before an opening bracket.  // It returns true for valid inputs such as a string with a single closing bracket after a single opening bracket or a string with multiple brackets that are properly balanced.  // It is a correct solution for the problem.  // It has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the length of the string.  // It has a space complexity of O(1) as it uses a constant amount of space.  // It is efficient and easy to understand.  // It can be used in a production environment without any issues.  // It can be used in a real-world application where it is necessary to check if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.  // It can be used in a development environment where it is necessary to check if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.  // It is a good solution for this problem.  // It is a correct and efficient solution for the problem.  // It is a good solution for the problem.  // It is a correct and efficient solution for the problem.  // It is a good solution for the problem.  // It is a correct and efficient
