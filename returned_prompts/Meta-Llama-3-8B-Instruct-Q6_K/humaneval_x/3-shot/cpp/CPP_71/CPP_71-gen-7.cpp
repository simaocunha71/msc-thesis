}  // This function calculates the area of the triangle using Heron's formula if the sides form a valid triangle. If the sides do not form a valid triangle, it returns -1. The area is rounded to 2 decimal points.  // The condition a+b>c && a+c>b && b+c>a checks if the three sides form a valid triangle. If they do, the function calculates the semi-perimeter s and then calculates the area using Heron's formula. The area is then rounded to 2 decimal points before being returned. If the sides do not form a valid triangle, the function returns -1.  // The round function is used to round the area to 2 decimal points. The area is first multiplied by 100.0 to shift the decimal point, and then divided by 100.0 to round it to 2 decimal points.  // The function returns a float value representing the area of the triangle or -1 if the sides do not form a valid triangle.  // The function is used to calculate the area of a triangle given the lengths of its three sides.  // The function is useful in geometry and other areas where the area of a triangle needs to be calculated.  // The function can be used in a variety of applications, such as calculating the area of a triangle in a 2D graphics program or calculating the area of a triangle in a geographic information system.  // The function is easy to use and can be integrated into a program with a few lines of code.  // The function is a useful tool for anyone who needs to calculate the area of a triangle.  // The function is a simple and efficient way to calculate the area of a triangle.  // The function is a good example of how to use Heron's formula to calculate the area of a triangle.  // The function is a good example of how to use the round function to round a number to a certain number of decimal points.  // The function is a good example of how to use the if statement to check if a condition is true and then perform a certain action if it is.  // The function is a good example of how to use the return
