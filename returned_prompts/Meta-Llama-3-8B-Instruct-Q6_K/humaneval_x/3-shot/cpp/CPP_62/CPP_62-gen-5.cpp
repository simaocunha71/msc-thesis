// Note: The derivative of a polynomial is found by multiplying each term by its exponent and then decreasing the exponent by 1. This function does not work correctly for polynomials of degree 0 or 1.
// For polynomials of degree 0 or 1, the derivative is 0 or the same polynomial respectively. 
// So the function should handle these cases separately. 
// Also, it does not handle the case of a single element vector. 
// For example, derivative({1}) should return {0} but the function will return an empty vector. 
// Similarly, derivative({1}) should return {1} but the function will return an empty vector. 
// To handle these cases, we need to add conditions at the beginning of the function to handle these cases separately. 
// We should also add a condition to check if the input vector is empty and return an empty vector in this case. 
// The function should look like this:
#include<stdio.h>
#include<math.h>
#include<vector>

// In this case, the derivative should return a vector with a single element, 0. 
// So, we need to add a condition to check if the degree of the polynomial is 0.
