}  // This is the correct solution. It creates a new vector to hold the result, pushes 0 to the result (since the derivative of a constant is 0), and then iterates through the input vector, multiplying each coefficient by its index (since the derivative of x^n is nx^(n-1)) and adding it to the result vector.  // The output vector will contain the coefficients of the derivative polynomial.  // For example, the derivative of 3 + 2x + x^2 is 2 + 2x, so the output will be {2, 2}.  // For example, the derivative of 3 + 2x + 3x^2 is 2 + 6x, so the output will be {2, 6}.  // For example, the derivative of 3 is 0, so the output will be {0}.  // For example, the derivative of 0 is 0, so the output will be {0}.  // The function correctly handles the case when the input vector is empty, returning an empty vector.  // The function correctly handles the case when the input vector contains only one element, returning a vector with a single element (0).  // The function correctly handles the case when the input vector contains more than one element, returning a vector with the correct coefficients.  // The function does not modify the input vector.  // The function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the input vector.  // The function has a space complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the input vector.  // The function uses the built-in multiplication and addition operators.  // The function uses a loop to iterate through the input vector.  // The function uses a vector to store the result.  // The function uses the push_back method to add elements to the result vector.  // The function does not use any advanced data structures or algorithms.  // The function does not use any external libraries or functions.  // The function is correct and efficient.  // The function is easy to understand and maintain.  // The function is well-documented.  // The function has a clear and concise name.  // The function has a clear and concise
