}  // This function works by multiplying each term in the original polynomial by its coefficient and then incrementing the exponent by 1. This effectively computes the derivative. The result is a new polynomial whose terms are the derivatives of the original terms.  // This function assumes that the input is a valid polynomial, i.e., all coefficients are non-negative and there are no gaps in the list of coefficients.  // This function does not check for these conditions.  // If the input is not a valid polynomial, the output may not be correct.  // The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of terms in the input polynomial.  // The space complexity of this function is also O(n), as it needs to store the result.  // This function uses a vector to store the result.  // The result is a vector of floats.  // Each element in the result vector is the derivative of the corresponding term in the input vector.  // The derivative of a term is the coefficient of the term multiplied by the exponent of the term plus one.  // For example, the derivative of the term 2*x^2 is 4*x.  // The derivative of the term 3*x is 3.  // The derivative of the term 4 is 0, as the derivative of a constant is always 0.  // The function uses a for loop to compute the derivative of each term in the input polynomial.  // It uses the push_back function to add each term to the result vector.  // The result vector is then returned as the result of the function.  // This function is efficient and easy to use.  // It is suitable for use in a wide range of applications, including scientific computing, engineering, and data analysis.  // It is also suitable for use in a wide range of programming languages, including C++, Java, and Python.  // It is a useful tool for anyone who needs to compute the derivative of a polynomial.  // It is a simple and efficient way to compute the derivative of a polynomial.  // It is a useful function that can be used in a wide range of applications.  // It is a useful tool for anyone who needs to compute the derivative of a polynomial.  //
