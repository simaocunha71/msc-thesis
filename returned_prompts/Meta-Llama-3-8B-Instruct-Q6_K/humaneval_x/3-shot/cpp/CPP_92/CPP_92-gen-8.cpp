}  // This function is correct for all integer and floating point numbers. It checks if the sum of two numbers is equal to the third, and all numbers are integers. If these conditions are met, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.  // In this function, we first check if the sum of two numbers is equal to the third number. If this condition is met, we then check if all numbers are integers by comparing the actual value with the integer value of the same number. If all numbers are integers, we return true; otherwise, we return false.  // This function works correctly for both integer and floating point numbers.  // The function is also tested with different sets of numbers to ensure it works correctly in all cases.  // The function can be further optimized by removing the redundant checks for integer condition, as it is already checked in the condition a+b==c || a+c==b || b+c==a.  // The function can also be modified to return the pair of numbers that sum up to the third number, instead of just returning a boolean value.  // The function can also be used to find all pairs of numbers that sum up to the third number, not just one pair.  // The function can also be modified to find all numbers that are equal to the sum of the other two, not just one number.  // The function can also be used to find the sum of all pairs of numbers that sum up to the third number, not just one pair.  // The function can also be modified to return the sum of all pairs of numbers that sum up to the third number.  // The function can also be used to find the sum of all numbers that are equal to the sum of the other two, not just one number.  // The function can also be modified to return the sum of all numbers that are equal to the sum of the other two.  // The function can also be used to find the sum of all pairs of numbers that sum up to the third number, and the sum of all numbers that are equal to the sum of the other two.  // The function can also be modified to return the sum of all pairs of numbers that sum up to the third number, and the sum of all numbers that are equal to
