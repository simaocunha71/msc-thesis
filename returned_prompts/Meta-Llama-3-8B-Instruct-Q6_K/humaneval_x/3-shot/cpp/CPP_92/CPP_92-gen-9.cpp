}  // 1. Check if a+b=c, a+c=b, or b+c=a. If any of these conditions are met, return true. Otherwise, return false. This ensures that one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two. 2. Ensure that all numbers are integers by casting them to integer using the int() function. This is done by checking if the absolute difference between the original number and the integer version of the number is less than 1e-9 (a very small number). If the absolute difference is less than 1e-9, it means that the number is an integer. 3. Return the result of the check. If the number is an integer and the condition is met, return true. Otherwise, return false. 4.  // 2. Ensure that all numbers are integers by casting them to integer using the int() function.
