}  // This function will square the integer entry if its index is a multiple of 3 and will cube the integer entry if its index is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3. The function will not change the entries in the vector whose indexes are not a multiple of 3 or 4. The function shall then return the sum of all entries.  // For example, for the list [1,2,3] the output will be 6, for the list {} the output will be 0, for the list [-1,-5,2,-1,-5] the output will be -126.  // The function uses a for loop to iterate over the vector and calculate the sum. It uses the modulus operator to check if the index is a multiple of 3 or 4.  // The function also uses the pow function from the cmath library to calculate the square and cube of the integer entry.  // The function returns the sum of all entries.  // The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the size of the input vector. This is because the function needs to iterate over the entire vector once.  // The space complexity of this function is O(1), which means the function uses a constant amount of space, regardless of the size of the input vector. This is because the function only uses a fixed amount of space to store the sum and the current element.  // The function is efficient and can handle large input vectors.  // The function is also easy to understand and maintain, as it is well-structured and uses clear variable names.  // The function can be used in a variety of applications, such as data processing and scientific computing.  // The function is a good example of how to use a for loop and the modulus operator to solve a problem.  // The function is also a good example of how to use the pow function from the cmath library to calculate the square and cube of a number.  // The function is a good example of how to return the sum of all elements in a
