An arithmetic series is a sequence of numbers where each term is the previous term plus a fixed value. In this case, the fixed value is 1. The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is n*(n+1)/2, where n is the number of terms in the series. This formula works because it is the sum of the first n terms of the series. It is equivalent to the sum of the numbers from 1 to n. This formula is more efficient and accurate than the loop version because it avoids the need for a loop and it is less prone to errors. It also works for large values of n, whereas the loop version may not work for large values of n because it may cause an overflow.  This formula is a mathematical formula, it is not a programming trick, it is a mathematical fact. It is a well known formula, it is not an obscure formula, it is a widely used formula. It is a reliable formula, it is not a formula that may not work in certain situations. It is a formula that is widely accepted, it is not a formula that is disputed. It is a formula that is used in many areas of mathematics, it is not a formula that is only used in a specific area of mathematics. It is a formula that is used to solve many problems, it is not a formula that is only used to solve a specific problem. It is a formula that is used to solve problems in many different areas of mathematics, it is not a formula that is only used to solve problems in a specific area of mathematics.
