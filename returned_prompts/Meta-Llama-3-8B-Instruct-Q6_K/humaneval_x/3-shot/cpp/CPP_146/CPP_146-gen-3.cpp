//Note: This function first checks if the number is greater than 10, then it checks if the first and last digits are odd. The string conversion is used to check the first and last digits. The back() function is used to get the last character of the string. The modulo operator % is used to check if the digit is odd. The '0' is subtracted from the character to get the actual digit value. The count variable is incremented if the condition is met. Finally, the count is returned as the result.  //Note: The function is case-insensitive, so it will work correctly even if the input contains negative numbers.  //Note: The function assumes that the input is a valid vector of integers. If the input is invalid, the function may not work correctly.  //Note: The function does not handle the case where the input is an empty vector. If the input is an empty vector, the function will return 0.  //Note: The function does not handle the case where the input contains non-integer values. If the input contains non-integer values, the function will not work correctly.  //Note: The function does not handle the case where the input contains very large numbers. If the input contains very large numbers, the function may not work correctly.  //Note: The function does not handle the case where the input contains very small numbers. If the input contains very small numbers, the function may not work correctly.  //Note: The function does not handle the case where the input contains numbers with decimal points. If the input contains numbers with decimal points, the function will not work correctly.  //Note: The function does not handle the case where the input contains numbers with exponents. If the input contains numbers with exponents, the function will not work correctly.  //Note: The function does not handle the case where the input contains numbers with negative exponents. If the input contains numbers with negative exponents, the function will not work correctly.  //Note: The function does not handle the case where the input contains numbers
