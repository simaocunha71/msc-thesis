Here are the C++ programs for the given problems:

1.  **has_close_elements()**:
    This function takes a vector of float numbers and a threshold as input. It checks if any two numbers in the vector are closer to each other than the given threshold. If such a pair is found, it returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.

2.  **separate_paren_groups()**:
    This function takes a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses as input. It separates these groups into separate strings and returns a vector of those. The groups are balanced (each open brace is properly closed) and not nested within each other. It ignores any spaces in the input string.

3.  **truncate_number()**:
    This function takes a float number as input and returns its decimal part. It does this by subtracting the integer part of the number from the original number.

4.  **is_palindrome()**:
    This function takes a string as input and checks if it is a palindrome. It does this by comparing the input string with its reverse.

5.  **make_palindrome()**:
    This function takes a string as input and returns the shortest palindrome that begins with the supplied string. It does this by finding the longest postfix of the supplied string that is a palindrome and appending the reverse of the string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix to the end of the string.
