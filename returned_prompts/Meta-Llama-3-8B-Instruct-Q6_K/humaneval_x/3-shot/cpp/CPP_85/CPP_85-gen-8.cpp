}  // This function adds all even elements at odd indices. Note that the index starts from 1. Hence the condition in the loop is i=1, not i=0.  // This is a very simple function and could be further optimized.  // It could also be written using lambda functions, or with a range-based for loop, or using std::accumulate.  // But the basic idea remains the same: loop over the elements, check if they are even and at odd indices, and add them up.  // This function assumes that the input vector is not empty.  // It also assumes that the input vector contains only integers.  // The function returns the sum of the even elements at odd indices.  // This function could be extended to handle other types of input, such as floating point numbers, or to handle cases where the input vector is empty.  // It could also be optimized further by using a more efficient algorithm, or by using a more efficient data structure.  // But for now, this is a simple and straightforward solution.  // It is also a good exercise in writing a simple function, and in using the modulo operator.  // The function could be tested with a variety of inputs, such as {4, 2, 6, 7}, {1, 3, 5}, {2, 4, 6}, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.  // The function could also be tested with edge cases, such as an empty vector, or a vector with only one element.  // The function should return the correct result for all of these cases.  // The function could also be used as a starting point for further development.  // For example, it could be extended to handle more complex logic, or to handle more complex data structures.  // But for now, this is a simple and straightforward solution.  // It is also a good exercise in writing a simple function, and in using the modulo operator.  // The function could be tested with a variety of inputs, such as {4, 2, 6, 7}, {1, 3, 5}, {2, 4, 6}, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5
