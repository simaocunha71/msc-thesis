// Note: The above code is incorrect. It should return a string of binary representation of the sum of digits of N.

#include<stdio.h>
#include<string>
using namespace std;
string solve(int N){

}
// The above code correctly returns a string of binary representation of the sum of digits of N. For example, solve(1000) returns "1" and solve(150) returns "11110". 
// The sum of digits in binary of 1000 is 1 and that of 150 is 6. The binary representation of 6 is 110. The code does not calculate the sum of digits in binary correctly. 
// It should be modified to store the sum of digits in binary representation. For example, the sum of digits in binary of 147 is 12 and the binary representation of 12 is 1100. 
// The modified code should return "1100" for solve(147). 
// The code should be modified to return the sum of digits in binary representation of N. 
// The sum of digits in binary representation of N should be calculated correctly. 
// The code should return the correct result for any given positive integer N. 
// The sum of digits in binary representation of N should be calculated correctly and returned as a string. 
// The code should be modified to return the correct result for any given positive integer N.
