} // It returns -1 if no such element exists. If no element is found which is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it, then we return -1. Otherwise, it returns the largest index of such an element.  // It checks each element in the array starting from the second element. If it finds an element that is not greater than or equal to the element before it, it returns the index of that element. If it doesn't find such an element, it returns -1. // The time complexity is O(n), where n is the size of the array. This is because we are traversing the array once.  // The space complexity is O(1), as we are using a constant amount of space to store the index and the elements.  // The function can_arrange() is used to find the largest index of an element which is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it in the given array. It returns -1 if no such element exists.  // The function can_arrange() can be used in situations where we need to find the largest index of an element which is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it in the given array. It can be used in various applications such as in data structures, algorithms, and other programming constructs.  // It is a useful function that can be used to solve problems related to arrays and indexing. It can be used in combination with other functions to solve more complex problems.  // The function can_arrange() is a simple and efficient function that can be used to find the largest index of an element which is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it in the given array.
