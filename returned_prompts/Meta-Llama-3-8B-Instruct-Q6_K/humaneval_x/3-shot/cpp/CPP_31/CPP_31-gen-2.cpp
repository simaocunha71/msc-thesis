}  // This function works for long long numbers up to 2^63-1. For larger numbers, you'd need to use a library like GMP or implement a more efficient primality test like the Miller-Rabin test.  // Note that this function is not efficient for large numbers, it has a time complexity of O(sqrt(n)). For large numbers, a more efficient algorithm should be used.  // This function returns false for 0 and 1, and true for all prime numbers.  // This function uses trial division, which is not suitable for large numbers due to its high time complexity.  // For large numbers, you should use a more efficient algorithm like the Miller-Rabin test.  // The Miller-Rabin test is a probabilistic primality test, which means it has a small chance of returning a false positive (i.e., a composite number that is reported as prime).  // However, the probability of this happening can be made arbitrarily small by repeating the test enough times.  // The Miller-Rabin test is generally considered to be the most efficient and reliable method for testing whether a number is prime, especially for large numbers.  // It is often used in cryptographic applications where it is essential to test whether a number is prime.  // It is also used in other applications where it is necessary to test whether a number is prime, such as in number theory and algebra.  // The Miller-Rabin test is a simple and efficient algorithm that can be used to test whether a number is prime.  // It is based on the Fermat's Little Theorem and the Miller-Rabin test.  // It is often used in cryptographic applications where it is essential to test whether a number is prime.  // It is also used in other applications where it is necessary to test whether a number is prime, such as in number theory and algebra.  // It is a simple and efficient algorithm that can be used to test whether a number is prime.  // It is based on the Fermat's Little Theorem and the Miller-Rabin test.  // It is often used in cryptographic applications where it is essential to test whether a number is prime.  // It is also used in other applications where it is necessary to test whether a number is prime, such as
