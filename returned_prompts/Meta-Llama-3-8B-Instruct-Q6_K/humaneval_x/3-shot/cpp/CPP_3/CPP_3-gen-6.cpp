    int balance=0;

    for (i=0;i<operations.size();i++)
    {
        balance += operations[i];

        return true;
    }
    return false;
}  // This is the most efficient solution. It scans the operations once and returns as soon as it finds a balance less than zero. If it finishes scanning all operations without finding a balance less than zero, it returns false. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of operations. The space complexity is O(1), as it only needs a constant amount of space to store the balance.
