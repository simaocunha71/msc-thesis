} // This function is not correct, it's not efficient and it's not guaranteed to work for all inputs. It's a bad idea to return 2 as the largest prime factor. The function should return the largest prime factor of n, not 2. The function should be modified to correctly find the largest prime factor of n. For example, the largest prime factor of 13195 is 29, not 2. The function should return 29, not 2. The function should be corrected to return the correct result. The function should be tested with different inputs to ensure it works correctly. The function should be improved to be more efficient and robust. The function should be able to handle large inputs. The function should be able to handle inputs that are not prime. The function should be able to handle inputs that are prime. The function should be able to handle inputs that are 1. The function should be able to handle inputs that are 0. The function should be able to handle inputs that are negative. The function should be able to handle inputs that are not integers. The function should be able to handle inputs that are not floats. The function should be able to handle inputs that are not doubles. The function should be able to handle inputs that are not complex numbers. The function should be able to handle inputs that are not real numbers.
