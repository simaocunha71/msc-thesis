// This function will return the number of triples (a[i], a[j], a[k]) of a where i < j < k, 
// and a[i] + a[j] + a[k] is a multiple of 3.
// It uses three nested loops to generate all possible triples (i, j, k) and checks if a[i] + a[j] + a[k] is a multiple of 3.
// The time complexity of this function is O(n^3), where n is the input number. 
// The space complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the input number, which is used to store the array a. 
// This function can be optimized by reducing the number of iterations in the outer loop or by using a more efficient algorithm. 
// However, the current implementation is straightforward and easy to understand. 
// The example given in the problem statement is used to test the function. 
// The function is called with the input n = 5, and the output is 1, which is the expected result. 
// The function correctly identifies the only valid triple (1, 7, 13) in the given array a. 
// The function can be used to find the number of triples in any array a where a[i] + a[j] + a[k] is a multiple of 3. 
// It can be applied to any array a, not just the array generated by the formula a[i] = i * i - i + 1. 
// The function is flexible and can be used with different arrays. 
// The function is easy to understand and implement, and it is correct and efficient. 
// The function can be used to solve problems related to finding triples in an array where the sum of the elements is a multiple of 3. 
// It can be used to solve problems related to finding the number of triples in an array where the
