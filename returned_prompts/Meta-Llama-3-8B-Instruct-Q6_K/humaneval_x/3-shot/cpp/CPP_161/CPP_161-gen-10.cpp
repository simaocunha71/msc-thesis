}  // This function uses the standard library functions isalpha(), tolower(), toupper() and reverse() to solve the problem. It iterates over the string, checks each character to see if it's a letter, and if it is, it changes its case. Finally, it reverses the string.  // The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because it needs to iterate over the string once to change the case of the letters and once to reverse the string.  // The space complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because it needs to create a new string to store the result.  // The function uses the isalpha() function to check if a character is a letter, the tolower() function to change a letter to lower case, the toupper() function to change a letter to upper case, and the reverse() function to reverse a string.  // The function is implemented in C++ and uses the standard library functions to solve the problem.  // The function is easy to understand and use, and it can be used to solve a variety of problems that involve changing the case of letters and reversing strings.  // The function can be used with strings that contain letters, numbers, and special characters.  // The function returns a string that is the result of changing the case of the letters in the input string and reversing the string.  // The function is a useful tool for any programmer who needs to manipulate strings in their code.  // The function can be used in a variety of applications, such as text processing, data analysis, and software development.  // The function is a simple and efficient way to solve the problem of changing the case of letters and reversing strings.  // The function is a good example of how to use the standard library functions to solve a problem.  // The function is a useful tool for any programmer who needs to manipulate strings in their code.  // The function can be used in a variety of applications, such as text processing, data analysis, and software development.  // The function is a simple
