The above code is written in C++ and defines several functions for different tasks. The functions are:
1. `has_close_elements` : This function checks if any two numbers in a given vector are closer to each other than a given threshold.
2. `separate_paren_groups` : This function separates groups of nested parentheses in a given string into separate strings.
3. `truncate_number` : This function returns the decimal part of a given floating point number.
4. `median` : This function returns the median of the elements in a given vector.

Each function is implemented using C++ syntax and standard library functions. The functions are tested with sample inputs to demonstrate their functionality.
