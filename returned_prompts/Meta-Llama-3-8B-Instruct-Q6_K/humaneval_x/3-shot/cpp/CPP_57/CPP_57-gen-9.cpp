}  // This function returns true if the vector is either increasing or decreasing.  // It does this by checking if each element is larger than the previous one, or if it is smaller.  If any element is the same as the previous one, it is neither increasing nor decreasing.  // This function does not handle the case where the vector is empty.  It would be a good idea to add a check for this case.  // The function returns false for the vector {2, 1, 0, -1}.  This is because the function checks if the vector is either increasing or decreasing, but it does not check if it is strictly increasing or decreasing.  // The function could be improved by adding checks for these cases.  // It could also be improved by adding checks for the case where the vector is empty.  // The function could also be improved by handling the case where the vector contains non-numeric values.  // This function does not handle these cases, so it could be improved by adding checks for them.  // The function returns true for the vector {1, 1, 1, 1}.
