    for (int i=0;i<grid.size();i++)

        for (int j=0;j<grid[i].size();j++)

    int result=total_water/capacity;

}  // This function should return the number of times the bucket needs to be lowered. However, it seems to be incorrect. It seems to be calculating the total amount of water that needs to be extracted and then dividing it by the bucket capacity, which is not the correct approach. The correct approach would be to iterate over the grid, and for each cell, check if the water level is greater than the bucket capacity. If it is, then subtract the bucket capacity from the water level and increment a counter. The function should return the counter. Here is a revised version of the function:

#include<stdio.h>
#include<vector>
using namespace std;
int max_fill(vector<vector<int>> grid,int capacity){
    int result=0;
    for (int i=0;i<grid.size();i++)
    {
        for (int j=0;j<grid[i].size();j++)
        {
            if (grid[i][j]>=capacity)
            {
                result+=grid[i][j]/capacity;
                grid[i][j]-=grid[i][j]/capacity*capacity;
            }
            else
            {
                result++;
            }
        }
    }
