}  // This function calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation for the given set of numbers.  // It calculates the mean of the set first and then calculates the absolute difference  // between each element and the mean and finally returns the average of these absolute differences.  // The function works correctly for the given example.  // However, it does not handle cases where the input set is empty.  // It assumes that the input set will always contain at least one element.  // If the input set is empty, the function will return 0.0, which may not be the desired result.  // To handle this case, you can add a check at the beginning of the function to return a special value (like -1.0 or NaN) if the set is empty.  // This function also does not handle cases where the input set contains non-numeric values.  // It assumes that the input set will always contain only numeric values.  // If the input set contains non-numeric values, the function will return incorrect results.  // To handle this case, you can add a check at the beginning of the function to return a special value (like -1.0 or NaN) if the set contains non-numeric values.  // The function can be improved by adding these checks and by using more efficient algorithms.  // For example, you can use the sum of the squares of the elements to calculate the mean and the sum of the absolute differences to calculate the MAD.  // This can reduce the number of operations from O(n) to O(1), where n is the size of the input set.  // However, this will also change the behavior of the function for certain inputs, so you should be careful when making these changes.  // The function can also be improved by using more efficient algorithms to calculate the mean and the MAD.  // For example, you can use the formula for the mean to calculate it in O(1) time, and you can use the formula for the MAD to calculate it in O(1) time.  //
