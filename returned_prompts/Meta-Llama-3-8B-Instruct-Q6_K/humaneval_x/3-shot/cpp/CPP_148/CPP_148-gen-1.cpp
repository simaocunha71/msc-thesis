}  // This is a very inefficient solution. It's not even correct. For example, it doesn't handle the case where planet1 is "Neptune" and planet2 is "Mercury". It also doesn't return an empty vector if the planet names are not correct. It's also not sorted by proximity to the sun. A correct solution would be to use a map to store the planets and their distances from the sun, then find the positions of planet1 and planet2 in the map, and return all planets between them. But this is too complex for this problem.  // It's also worth noting that the problem doesn't specify what to do if planet1 or planet2 are not correct planet names. The problem should be modified to specify that the function should return an empty vector in this case.  // This problem should also specify that the function should return the planets in the order they appear in the solar system, i.e., the order they are in the vector "planets".  // A correct solution would be to use a map to store the planets and their distances from the sun, then find the positions of planet1 and planet2 in the map, and return all planets between them.  // This is a very inefficient solution.
