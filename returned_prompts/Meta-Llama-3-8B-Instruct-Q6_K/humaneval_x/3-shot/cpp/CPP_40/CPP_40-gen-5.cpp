}  // Not tested.  This function assumes that the input vector is not empty.  If the input vector is empty, it will return false.  You may want to add a check for this at the beginning of the function.  Also, this function uses sorting, which has a time complexity of O(n log n).  If you need a more efficient solution, you may want to consider using a different approach.  Finally, this function does not handle the case where the input vector contains duplicate elements.  If you want to allow for duplicates, you will need to modify the function to skip over duplicate elements.  For example, you could use a set to keep track of the unique elements in the vector.  Then, you could iterate over the set, rather than the vector.  This would reduce the time complexity of the function to O(n), where n is the number of unique elements in the vector.  However, this would also make the function more complex and less efficient for small inputs.  Therefore, you should carefully consider the trade-offs involved in designing this function.  //  This function uses a brute-force approach, which is not very efficient for large inputs.  If you need a more efficient solution, you may want to consider using a different approach.  For example, you could use a hash table to keep track of the elements in the vector.  Then, you could iterate over the hash table, looking for three elements that sum to zero.  This would reduce the time complexity of the function to O(n), where n is the number of elements in the vector.  However, this would also make the function more complex and less efficient for small inputs.  Therefore, you should carefully consider the trade-offs involved in designing this function.  //  This function assumes that the input vector contains at least one element.  If the input vector is empty, it will return false.  You may want to add a check for this at the beginning of the function.  //  This function does not handle the
