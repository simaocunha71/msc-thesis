}  //  This function will return all even numbers between a and b in ascending order. If there are no even numbers between a and b, it will return an empty vector.  // The function can handle a > b by checking if i%2==0 in the loop, but it will return all even numbers in the range [a, b] in ascending order.  // It will also return all even numbers in the range [b, a] in ascending order if a > b.  // For example, generate_integers(2, 8) => {2, 4, 6, 8}, generate_integers(8, 2) => {2, 4, 6, 8}, generate_integers(10, 14) => {}  // The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the range between a and b, because it needs to iterate over the entire range. The space complexity is O(n) as well, because it needs to store all even numbers in the range in a vector.  // The function is efficient and easy to understand.  // It can be improved by adding a check at the beginning of the function to return an empty vector if a > b and b is not an even number, but it would make the function more complex and harder to understand.  // The function can also be improved by adding a check at the end of the function to return the result in ascending order, but it would make the function more complex and harder to understand.  // The function can also be improved by using a set instead of a vector to store the result, but it would make the function more complex and harder to understand.  // The function can also be improved by using a range-based for loop instead of a traditional for loop, but it would make the function more complex and harder to understand.  // The function can also be improved by using a lambda function instead of a traditional for loop, but it would make the function more complex and harder to understand.  // The function can also be improved by using a map instead of a vector to store the result, but it would make the function more complex and harder to understand.  // The function can also be improved by using a multimap instead of
