    if (n <= 1)
        return y;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n / 2; i++)
        if (n % i == 0)
            return y;
    return x;
}  // Corrected Code
// The function will return y if n is not prime, and return x if n is prime.
// The loop checks if n is divisible by any number from 2 to n/2. If it is, then n is not a prime number. If the loop doesn't find any such number, then n is a prime number.
