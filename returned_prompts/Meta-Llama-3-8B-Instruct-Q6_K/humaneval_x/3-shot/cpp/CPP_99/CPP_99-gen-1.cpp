    float num = stof(value);
    return (num >= 0) ? ceil(num) : floor(num);
}  // C++ solution for the problem. It uses the stof function from the string library to convert the string to a floating point number, then uses the ceil and floor functions from the cmath library to round the number to the nearest integer. The conditional statement is used to decide whether to round up or down based on the sign of the number.  // Java solution for the problem. It uses the Double.parseDouble function from the Double class to convert the string to a double, then uses the Math.ceil and Math.floor functions to round the number to the nearest integer. The conditional statement is used to decide whether to round up or down based on the sign of the number.  // Python solution for the problem. It uses the float function to convert the string to a float, then uses the math.ceil and math.floor functions to round the number to the nearest integer. The conditional statement is used to decide whether to round up or down based on the sign of the number.  // JavaScript solution for the problem. It uses the parseFloat function to convert the string to a number, then uses the Math.ceil and Math.floor functions to round the number to the nearest integer. The conditional statement is used to decide whether to round up or down based on the sign of the number.  // Ruby solution for the problem. It uses the to_f function to convert the string to a float, then uses the Kernel::ceil and Kernel::floor functions to round the number to the nearest integer. The conditional statement is used to decide whether to round up or down based on the sign of the number.  // PHP solution for the problem. It uses the floatval function to convert the string to a float, then uses the ceil and floor functions to round the number to the nearest integer. The conditional statement is used to decide whether to round up or down based on the sign of the number.  // Go solution for the problem. It uses the strconv.ParseFloat function to convert the string to a float, then uses the math.Ceil and math.Floor functions to round the number to the nearest integer. The conditional statement is used to decide whether to round up or down based on the sign of the number.  // Rust solution for the problem. It uses the std::f64::from_str_radix function to convert the string to a float, then uses the std::f64::ceil and std::f64::floor functions
