C++11 code snippet that filters a list of `boost::any` objects to only include integers.

The code iterates over the list of `boost::any` objects using a range-based for loop. For each object, it checks if the object can be safely cast to an `int` using `boost::any_cast<int>(value)`. If the cast is successful, it means the object is an integer, so it is added to the result vector.

The `filter_integers` function takes a list of `boost::any` objects as input and returns a vector of integers.

In the `main` function, we create a list of `boost::any` objects with a mix of integer and non-integer values. We then call the `filter_integers` function with this list as input and print the result.

The output of this program will be:
```
1 2 3 5
```
