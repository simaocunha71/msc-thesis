A solution in C++ for the problem you described. This code creates a new string `temp` by iterating over `s` and adding each character to `temp` only if it's not found in `c`. Then it checks if the reversed `temp` is equal to the original `temp`. If they are equal, the function returns a vector containing an empty string and "True", indicating that the string is a palindrome. If they are not equal, the function returns a vector containing the modified `temp` and "False". In the `main` function, we test this function with the given example. The output will be "cdedc False". A solution in C++ for the problem you described.
