The code provided is a solution to the problem. It defines two functions: `reverse_delete` and `is_palindrome`. The `reverse_delete` function takes two strings `s` and `c` as input, and returns a vector containing the result string and a boolean indicating whether the result string is a palindrome. The `is_palindrome` function checks if a given string is a palindrome.

In the `reverse_delete` function, it iterates through the string `s` and checks if each character is equal to any character in `c`. If a match is found, it erases the character from `s`. After all characters in `c` have been checked, it checks if the resulting string is a palindrome using the `is_palindrome` function. If it is, it returns a vector containing the result string and "True". Otherwise, it returns a vector containing the result string and "False".

In the `main` function, it tests the `reverse_delete` function with the input strings "abcdedcba" and "ab", and prints the result.

Here is the code with proper indentation and comments:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

// Function to delete characters in s that are equal to any character in c
vector<string> reverse_delete(string s,
