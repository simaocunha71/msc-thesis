B:
The solution is in the A section. The function reverse_delete takes two strings s and c as input. It first creates a temporary copy of the string s. Then it removes all the characters in c from the temporary copy. It checks if the resulting string is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse. If it is a palindrome, it appends "True" to the result vector, otherwise it appends "False". Finally, it appends the resulting string to the result vector and returns it.

The main function takes two strings s and c as input from the user, calls the reverse_delete function with these strings, and prints the result.

Note: The erase-remove idiom is used to remove all occurrences of a character from a string in the reverse_delete function. This is a common idiom in C++ that combines the erase and remove functions to efficiently remove elements from a sequence. The remove function returns an iterator pointing to the new end of the sequence, and the erase function is used to actually remove the elements. This idiom is used here to remove all occurrences of characters in c from the string s.
