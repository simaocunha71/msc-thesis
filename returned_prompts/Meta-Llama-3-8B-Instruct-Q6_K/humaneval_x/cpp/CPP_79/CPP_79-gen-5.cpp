    // Your code goes here
    string binary = "";
    while(decimal > 0){
        binary = (decimal % 2 == 0 ? "0" : "1") + binary;
        decimal /= 2;
    }
    return "db" + binary + "db";
}

B:
    // Test cases
    int main() {
        printf("%s\n", decimal_to_binary(15).c_str());
        printf("%s\n", decimal_to_binary(32).c_str());
        return 0;
    }

C:
    // Output
    db1111db
    db100000db

This problem is asking you to write a function that takes an integer as input and returns its binary representation as a string. The function should return a string that starts with "db", followed by the binary representation of the input integer, and ends with "db".

Here is a Python solution for this problem:

```python
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    binary = bin(decimal)[2:]
    return "db" + binary + "db"
```

You can test this function with the following test cases:

```python
print(decimal_to_binary(15))   # Output: db1111db
print(decimal_to_binary(32))   # Output: db100000db
```

In this solution, the `bin()` function is used to convert the decimal integer to a binary string. The `[2:]` is used to remove the '0b' prefix that `bin()` adds to the binary string. Then, the "db" string is added to the beginning and end of the binary string.
