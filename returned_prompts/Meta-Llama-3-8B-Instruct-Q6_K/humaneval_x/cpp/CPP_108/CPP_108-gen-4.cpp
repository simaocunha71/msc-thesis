S:
    The function `count_nums` takes a vector of integers as input and returns the count of elements where the sum of digits is greater than 0. If the number is negative, the first digit is considered as negative. 

    The function iterates over each number in the vector. For each number, it calculates the sum of its digits. If the number is negative, it takes the absolute value and stores the sign separately. Then, it calculates the sum of digits and multiplies it with the sign to get the correct sum. If the sum is greater than 0, it increments the count.

    Finally, the function returns the count of numbers with sum of digits greater than 0.

    Here is the Python code for the same problem:

```python
def count_nums(n):
    count = 0
    for i in n:
        sum = 0
        sign = 1
        if i < 0:
            sign = -1
            i = -i
        while i > 0:
            sum += i % 10
            i //= 10
        sum *= sign
        if sum > 0:
            count += 1
    return count
```

This Python code is similar to the C++ code, but it uses the Python syntax and built-in functions. The `count_nums` function takes a list of integers as input and returns the count of elements where the sum of digits is greater than 0. If the number is negative, the first digit is considered as negative. The function iterates over each number in the list, calculates the sum of its digits, and increments the count if the sum is greater than 0. Finally, the function returns the count.
