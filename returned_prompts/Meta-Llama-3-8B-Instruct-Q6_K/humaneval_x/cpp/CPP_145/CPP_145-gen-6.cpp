```

In this program, we create a function called `order_by_points` which takes a vector of integers as input and returns a new vector sorted by the sum of the digits of the numbers in the original vector. If there are multiple numbers with the same sum of digits, the function will sort them based on their original index in the vector.

The function first creates a new vector of pairs where each pair contains the sum of the digits of a number and its original index in the vector. Then, it sorts this vector of pairs based on the sum of the digits. Finally, it creates a new vector by taking the numbers from the original vector at the indices specified in the sorted vector of pairs.

In the `main` function, we test this function with a sample input vector `{1, 11, -1, -11, -12}` and print the output vector. The output will be `{-1, -11, 1, -12, 11}`.
