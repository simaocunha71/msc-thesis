    vector<float> result;
    for(int i = 1; i < xs.size(); i++){
        result.push_back(xs[i] * i);
    }
    return result;
}

C:
    int main() {
        vector<float> xs = {3, 1, 2, 4, 5};
        vector<float> result = derivative(xs);
        for(int i = 0; i < result.size(); i++){
            printf("%f ", result[i]);
        }
        printf("\n");
        return 0;
    }
Output:
4.000000 12.000000 20.000000

Explanation:
The code calculates the derivative of a polynomial by using the formula of differentiation for polynomials, which is the coefficient of each term gets multiplied by its degree and the degree is decremented by 1. The derivative of a polynomial is also a polynomial, so the result is a new polynomial with the same structure as the original polynomial. The main function tests the derivative function with a sample input and prints the result. The derivative function takes a vector of floats as input, calculates the derivative of the polynomial, and returns the result as a new vector of floats. The loop in the main function iterates over the result vector and prints each element. The output is the derivative of the polynomial represented by the input vector. For example, the derivative of the polynomial 3 + x + 2x^2 + 4x^3 + 5x^4 is 1 + 2x + 6x^2 + 12x^3 + 20x^4. The code can be easily extended to handle polynomials of any degree.
