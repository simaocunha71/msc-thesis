Explanation:

*   The task is to write a function `fruit_distribution` that takes a string `s` representing a number of apples and oranges, and an integer `n` representing the total number of fruits in the basket. The function should return the number of mango fruits in the basket.
*   The string `s` is in the format "x apples and y oranges", where `x` is the number of apples and `y` is the number of oranges.
*   The function should remove extra characters from the string, extract the number of apples and oranges, and return the number of mango fruits.
*   The function is implemented in the `fruit_distribution` function, which uses the `std::stoi` function to convert the string to an integer.
*   The function is tested in the `main` function with different inputs.

Output:

```

95

```

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`.

Space Complexity: O(1), as it only uses a
