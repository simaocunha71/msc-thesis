You're close! The code is almost correct. However, you should check both conditions: `isIncreasing` and `isDecreasing`. If either of them is `true`, then the vector is monotonic.

Here's the corrected code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

bool monotonic(vector<float> l) {
    bool isIncreasing = true;
    bool isDecreasing = true;
    for(int i = 0; i < l.size() - 1; i++){
        if(l[i] > l[i+1]){
            isIncreasing = false;
        }
        if(l[i] < l[i+1]){
            isDecreasing = false;
        }
    }
    return isIncreasing || isDecreasing;
}

int main(){
    vector<float> v = {1, 2, 4, 20};
    cout << monotonic(v) << endl;  // Output: 1 (true)
    return 0;
}
```

The `monotonic` function checks if the vector is either increasing or decreasing, and returns `true` if it is, and `false` otherwise. The `main` function creates a vector `v` and calls the `monotonic` function with `v` as the argument. The output will be `1`, which represents `true`.
