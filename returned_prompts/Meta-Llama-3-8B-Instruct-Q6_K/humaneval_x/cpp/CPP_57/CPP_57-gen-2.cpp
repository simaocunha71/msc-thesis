Solution:
The problem asks to check if the given vector is monotonically increasing or decreasing. A vector is said to be monotonically increasing if each element is greater than or equal to the previous element. Similarly, a vector is said to be monotonically decreasing if each element is less than or equal to the previous element.

The provided code correctly implements the solution. It iterates through the vector from the second element to the last. For each element, it checks if it is greater than the previous element (for increasing order) or less than the previous element (for decreasing order). If it finds an element that does not satisfy either condition, it sets the corresponding boolean flag to false. If both flags are still true after the loop, it means the vector is either increasing or decreasing, so the function returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the size of the input vector. This is because it iterates through the vector once. The space complexity is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the flags and the loop index.
