    if(n<3){
        return 0;
    }
    int a=0,b=0,c=2,d=0;
    for(int i=3;i<=n;i++){
        d=a+b+c;
        a=b;
        b=c;
        c=d;
    }
    return d;
}
int main(){
    int n;
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d",&n);
    printf("Fib4 number: %d\n",fib4(n));
    return 0;
}

S:
The problem is asking to write a function that calculates the nth Fibonacci sequence number, which is defined as follows:
fib4(0) -> 0
fib4(1) -> 0
fib4(2) -> 2
fib4(3) -> 0
fib4(n) -> fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4)

The problem statement also mentions that the function should not use recursion, which means it should use an iterative approach.

Here is the solution:

```c
#include<stdio.h>
using namespace std;
int fib4(int n){
    if(n<3){
        return 0;
    }
    int a=0,b=0,c=2,d=0;
    for(int i=3;i<=n;i++){
        d=a+b+c;
        a=b;
        b=c;
        c=d;
    }
    return d;
}
int main(){
    int n;
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d",&n);
    printf("Fib4 number: %d\n",fib4(n));
    return 0;
}
```

In this solution, we first handle the base cases where n is less than 3. Then we initialize four variables a, b, c, and d to 0, 0, 2, and 0 respectively. These variables will hold the last four numbers in the sequence.

We then use a for loop to iterate from 3 to n. In each iteration, we calculate the next number in the sequence by adding the last four numbers. We then update the last four numbers by shifting them one position to the right.

Finally, we return the last calculated number, which is the nth number in the sequence. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), which is much faster than the recursive solution for large values of n.
