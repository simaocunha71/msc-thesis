int main() {
    printf("%d\n", fib4(5));  // prints 4

S:
The solution uses a technique called "circular array" to efficiently compute the n-th element of the fib4 number sequence. This is done by maintaining an array a of size 5 and initializing it as {0,0,2,0,0}. Then, for each i from 5 to n, we calculate the next element by summing the previous four elements. We use the modulus operator to wrap around the array when calculating the next element.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), which is much more efficient than the recursive solution. The space complexity is O(1), since we only use a fixed-size array.

The test cases provided in the problem statement are:
>>> fib4(5)
4
>>> fib4(6)
8
>>> fib4(7)
14

These test cases are all correct, as can be verified by calculating the fib4 sequence manually. The function fib4(n) correctly returns the n-th element of the fib4 sequence.
