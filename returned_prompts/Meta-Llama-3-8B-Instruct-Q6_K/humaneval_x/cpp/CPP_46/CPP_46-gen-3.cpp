The code provided above implements the function `fib4(int n)` which calculates the n-th element of the fib4 number sequence. The function uses an array `fib4[5]` to store the previously calculated values. It initializes the first four elements of the array and then iterates from `i=4` to `n` to calculate the rest of the elements. The `i-th` element is calculated as the sum of the previous four elements.

The `main()` function prompts the user to enter a number `n` and then prints the `n-th` element of the fib4 sequence.

Here is the complete code:

```c
#include<stdio.h>
using namespace std;
int fib4(int n){
    int fib4[5];
    fib4[0]=0;
    fib4[1]=0;
    fib4[2]=2;
    fib4[3]=0;
    for(int i=4;i<=n;i++){
        fib4[i]=fib4[i-1]+fib4[i-2]+fib4[i-3]+fib4[i-4];
    }
    return fib4[n];
}

int main()
{
    int n;
    printf("Enter the number of the sequence: ");
    scanf("%d",&n);
    printf("The %d-th element of the fib4 sequence is %d\n",n,fib4(n));
    return 0;
}
```

You can test the code with different inputs to verify its correctness. For example, `fib4(5)` should return `4`, `fib4(6)` should return `8`, and `fib4(7)` should return `14`.
