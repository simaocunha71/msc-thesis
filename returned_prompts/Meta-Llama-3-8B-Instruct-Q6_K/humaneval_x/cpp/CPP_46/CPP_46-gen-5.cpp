S:
The solution provided is a correct implementation of the fib4 number sequence. It uses a loop to compute the n-th element of the sequence without using recursion. The loop iterates from i = 4 to n, and at each iteration, it calculates the next element of the sequence by adding the last four elements.

Here is a brief explanation of the code:

1. The function `fib4` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the n-th element of the fib4 sequence.

2. The function first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 2, in which case it returns 0, since fib4(0) = fib4(1) = 0.

3. If `n` is 3, it returns 2, since fib4(3) = 2.

4. For `n` greater than 3, the function initializes four variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` to store the last four elements of the sequence. The initial values are 0, 0, 2, and 0, respectively.

5. The function then enters a loop that iterates from `i = 4` to `n`. At each iteration, it calculates the next element of the sequence by adding the last four elements, and then updates the last four elements by shifting them one position to the right.

6. Finally, the function returns the n-th element of the sequence, which is stored in `a`.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), since it uses a loop that iterates `n` times. The space complexity is O(1), since it uses a constant amount of space to store the last four elements of the sequence.
