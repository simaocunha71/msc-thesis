The code is also correct for the problem. It checks for a substring within the main string. The function cycpattern_check checks if the string b is present in the string a or any of its rotations.

C:
The code is also correct for the problem. It checks for a substring within the main string. The function cycpattern_check checks if the string b is present in the string a or any of its rotations.

D:
The code is also correct for the problem. It checks for a substring within the main string. The function cycpattern_check checks if the string b is present in the string a or any of its rotations.

Explanation:
The function cycpattern_check checks if the string b is present in the string a or any of its rotations. The main string is split into substrings of length
