R:
The function count_upper takes a string s as an argument and returns the count of uppercase vowels in even indices. Here's how it works:

1. Initialize a counter variable count to 0.
2. Iterate through each character in the string using a for loop.
3. Check if the current index i is even (i.e., i % 2 == 0).
4. If the index is even, check if the character at that index is an uppercase vowel using the isupper function.
5. If the character is an uppercase vowel, increment the count variable.
6. Return the count variable at the end.

In the main function, we create a string s and call the count_upper function with s as an argument. We then print the result using printf.

This code will output 1, which is the correct count of uppercase vowels in even indices for the string "aBCdEf".
