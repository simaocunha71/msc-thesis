B:

C:
    vector<int> result;
    for(int num : numbers){
        auto it = std::find(result.begin(), result.end(), num);
        if(it == result.end()){
            result.push_back(num);
        }
    }
    return result;

}
int main() {
    vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 2, 4};
    vector<int> result = remove_duplicates(numbers);
    for(int num : result){
        printf("%d ", num);
    }
    printf("\n");
    return 0;

Answer: C is the best solution. It uses the `std::find` function from the `<algorithm>` library, which searches for the first occurrence of a specified value in a range of elements. It returns an iterator pointing to the first occurrence of the specified value, or `end()` if the value is not found. This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the result vector. It also has a space complexity of O(n), as it creates a new vector to store the result. The `remove_duplicates` function is a simple and efficient way to remove duplicate elements from a vector. It is also easy to read and understand, making it a good choice for production code. The other two solutions are less efficient and more complex to read and understand. Solution A has a time complexity of O(n^2), as it uses a nested loop to search for duplicate elements. Solution B has a time complexity of O(n^2), as it uses a nested loop to search for duplicate elements and also uses a boolean variable to keep track of whether an element has been found. Both solutions are less efficient and more complex to read and understand than Solution C. Therefore
