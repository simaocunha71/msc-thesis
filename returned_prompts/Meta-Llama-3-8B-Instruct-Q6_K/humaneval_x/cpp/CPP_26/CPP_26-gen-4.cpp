The code provided is not efficient and is not a good solution for this problem. It has a time complexity of O(n^2) because it is using nested loops to check for duplicates.

Here's a more efficient solution using a set to keep track of unique elements:

```cpp
#include<vector>
#include<set>
#include<algorithm>
using namespace std;

vector<int> remove_duplicates(vector<int> numbers) {
    set<int> seen;
    vector<int> result;
    for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++) {
        if (seen.find(numbers[i]) == seen.end()) {
            seen.insert(numbers[i]);
            result.push_back(numbers[i]);
        }
    }
    return result;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 2, 4};
    vector<int> result = remove_duplicates(numbers);
    for (int i = 0; i < result.size(); i++) {
        printf("%d ", result[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");
    return 0;
}
```

This code has a time complexity of O(n log n) because it is using a set to keep track of unique elements, which has a logarithmic time complexity for insertion and lookup operations. The outer loop iterates over the input vector, so the total time complexity is O(n log n).

In the code, a set `seen` is used to keep track of unique elements. For each element in the input vector, it checks if the element is already in the set using the `find` method. If the element is not in the set, it inserts the element into the set and adds it to
