    This program defines a function `encrypt` that takes a string as an argument and returns the string encrypted with the alphabet being rotated. The alphabet is rotated in a manner such that the letters shift down by two multiplied to two places.

    The function iterates over each character in the input string. If the character is a lowercase letter, it calculates the new character by subtracting the ASCII value of 'a' from the character, adding 4*2, taking the modulus with 26 (the number of letters in the alphabet), and then adding the ASCII value of 'a' back. This effectively rotates the alphabet by 8 places. If the character is an uppercase letter, it does the same calculation but with the ASCII value of 'A' instead.

    The function returns the encrypted string.

    In the `main` function, we test the `encrypt` function with the input string "hi" and print the result.

    Output:
    lm

    This shows that the function correctly encrypts the input string by rotating the alphabet by 8 places.

    Note: This encryption is not secure for sensitive information because it is a simple Caesar cipher. For secure encryption, you should use a more complex algorithm like AES.
