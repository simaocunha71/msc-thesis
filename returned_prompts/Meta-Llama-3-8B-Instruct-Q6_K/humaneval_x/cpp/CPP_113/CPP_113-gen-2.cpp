The given problem statement seems to be missing a crucial detail. The problem statement is asking for a function that takes a vector of strings, where each string consists of only digits, and returns a vector of strings. Each element i of the output string should be 'the number of odd elements in the i'th string of the input, where all the i's should be replaced by the number of odd digits in the i'th string of the input.

In the given code, the function `odd_count` is defined which takes a vector of strings as input and returns a vector of strings as output. The function iterates over each string in the input vector, counts the number of odd digits in the string, and then constructs a new string that starts with 'the number of odd elements ', followed by the count of odd digits, followed by ' in the string ', followed by the index of the string (plus one), followed by ' of the input.'.

In the `main` function, a vector of strings `lst` is created and passed to the `odd_count` function. The output of the `odd_count` function is then printed to the console.

Note that the problem statement does not specify what to do with the output strings. In this code, the output strings are simply printed to the console. If the problem statement is asking for something else to be done with the output strings, that should be specified.
