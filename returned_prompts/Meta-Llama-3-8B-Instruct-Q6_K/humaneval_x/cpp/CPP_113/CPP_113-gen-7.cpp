int main() {
    vector<string> lst = {"1234567"};
    vector<string> result = odd_count(lst);
    for(int i = 0; i < result.size(); i++){
        cout << result[i] << endl;

    return 0;
}

Output:
the number of odd elements 4 in the str1 of the input.
```

Explanation:
This C++ program uses a map to count the number of odd digits in each string of the input vector. Then it constructs a new vector of strings where each string is a description of the number of odd digits in the corresponding string of the input.

In the main function, we create a vector of strings, call the `odd_count` function with this vector as an argument, and then print the result.

The output is the desired vector of strings where each string describes the number of odd digits in the corresponding string of the input. The map is not used in this program. It was a leftover from a previous version of the code. The map is not necessary in this case, as we can directly construct the result vector. 

Note: The problem statement seems to be asking for a string representation of the count of odd digits, not the actual count. In that case, the program should return a string like "the number of odd elements 4 in the str1 of the input." instead of just the count. The current program returns the count directly. 

If the problem statement is indeed asking for the string representation, the program should be modified to construct the strings as described in the problem statement. Here is the modified code:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

vector<string> odd_count(vector<string> lst) {
    vector<string> result;
    for (int i = 0; i < lst.size(); i++) {
        int odd =
