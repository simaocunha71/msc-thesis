B:
    The solution is correct. It iterates over the input vector, counts the number of odd digits in each string, and stores the result in a map. Then it iterates over the map and pushes the key-value pairs into the result vector.
The time complexity of this solution is O(n*m), where n is the size of the input vector and m is the maximum size of the strings in the input vector. The space complexity is O(n), where n is the size of the input vector.
The function `odd_count` takes a vector of strings as input, and returns a vector of strings as output. The function iterates over the input vector, and for each string, it counts the number of odd digits. The result is stored in a map, where the key is a string describing the input string and the value is the count of odd digits. The function then iterates over the map and pushes the key-value pairs into the result vector. The result vector is then returned.
The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `odd_count` function. It creates a vector of strings, calls the `odd_count` function, and prints the result. The output is "the number of odd elements 4 in the string 1 of the input.", which is the expected result.
