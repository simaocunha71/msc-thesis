//time complexity: O(n*m*m) where n is the number of words and m is the length of the longest word.
//space complexity: O(n*m) where n is the number of words and m is the length of the longest word.
//The code is correct but it can be optimized by sorting the characters in each word individually and then replacing the word with the sorted version.
//The code can also be optimized by using a single loop to replace the words with their ordered versions instead of using a nested loop.
