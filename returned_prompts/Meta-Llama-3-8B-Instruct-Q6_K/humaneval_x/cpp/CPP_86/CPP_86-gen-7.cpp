O:
The code is written in C++ and it uses the standard library functions for string manipulation and sorting. The function `anti_shuffle` takes a string as input and returns a new string where all the words are replaced by a new word where all the characters are arranged in ascending order based on ASCII value.

The function iterates over the input string and for each word, it sorts the characters in ascending order and appends the sorted word to the result string.

In the `main` function, a test case is provided where the input string is "Hello World!!!" and the output is "Hello !!!Wdlor".

Time complexity of the code is O(n*m*logm) where n is the length of the input string and m is the maximum length of a word in the string. This is because for each word, we are sorting the characters which takes O(m*logm) time and we are doing this for each word in the string. The space complexity is O(n) as we are storing the result string.
