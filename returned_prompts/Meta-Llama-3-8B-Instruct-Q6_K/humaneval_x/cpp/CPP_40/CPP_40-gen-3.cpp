E:
    The problem is asking to check if there are three distinct elements in the vector that sum to zero. 

    To solve this problem, we can use a two-pointer technique. We first sort the vector in ascending order. Then we fix one element and use two pointers, one starting from the next element and one from the end of the vector, to find a pair of elements that sum to the negation of the fixed element. 

    If the sum of the three elements is less than zero, we move the left pointer to the right. If the sum is greater than zero, we move the right pointer to the left. If the sum is equal to zero, we return true.

    If we finish the loop without finding a triple that sums to zero, we return false.

    In the main function, we create a vector and call the triples_sum_to_zero function to check if there are three distinct elements that sum to zero. We print the result.

    The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the size of the vector. This is because we use a nested loop to find the triple.

    The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the indices and the sum.
