Answer:
The function is_sorted checks whether a given vector of integers is sorted in ascending order and contains no more than one duplicate of the same number. If the vector has more than one duplicate or is not sorted, the function returns false. Otherwise, it returns true.

The function first checks if the vector has only one element. If it does, the function returns true, as a single-element vector is considered sorted. Then, it iterates over the vector from the second element to the last element. For each element, it checks if the element is less than the previous element. If it is, the function returns false, as the vector is not sorted. If the element is equal to the previous element, the function also returns false, as the vector contains more than one duplicate. If the function finishes iterating over the vector without finding any duplicates or unsorted elements, it returns true, indicating that the vector is sorted and contains at most one duplicate.

In the main function, a vector is created and passed to the is_sorted function. The function checks whether the vector is sorted and contains at most one duplicate, and the result is printed to the console. In this case, the vector {1, 3, 2, 4, 5} is not sorted and contains more than one duplicate, so the function returns false.
