Answer:
The problem with the given code is that it is not efficient. The code checks every number to see if it is prime, which can be very slow for large inputs. We can improve this by only checking prime numbers. Here is a more efficient version of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

bool isPrime(int x) {
    if (x <= 1) return false;
    for (int i = 2; i * i <= x; i++) {
        if (x % i == 0) return false;
    }
    return true;
}

int prime_fib(int n) {
    int a = 0, b = 1, c = 1, count = 0;
    while (count < n) {
        c = a + b;
        if (isPrime(c)) {
            a = b;
            b = c;
            count++;
        } else {
            a = b;
            b = c;
        }
    }
    return c;
}

int main() {
    int n = 5;
    cout << prime_fib(n) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This version of the code only checks if a number is prime when it is generated, which is much faster. It also uses a variable `c` to store the current Fibonacci number, which is not prime, and a variable `a` and `b` to store the previous two Fibonacci numbers. This way, it can generate the Fibonacci sequence and check for prime numbers at the same time, which is more efficient.
