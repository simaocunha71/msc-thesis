The problem asks to empty the wells by using buckets with a certain capacity. We need to calculate the total number of times the buckets need to be lowered.

Here is a simple solution in C++. We iterate over each well in the grid, and for each well, we fill the bucket until it's full or there's no more water in the well. We add the number of units of water we've filled in the bucket to the result.

Here is the C++ code for the solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int max_fill(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int capacity) {
    int n = grid.size();
    int res = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int j = 0;
        int fill = 0;
        while (j < grid[i].size() && fill < capacity) {
            if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                fill++;
                grid[i][j] = 0;
            }
            j++;
        }
        res += fill;
    }
    return res;
}

int main() {
    vector<vector<int>> grid = {{0, 0, 1, 0}, {0, 1, 0, 0}, {1, 1, 1, 1}};
    int capacity = 1;
    cout << max_fill(grid, capacity) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this code, we define a function `max_fill` that takes a 2D vector `grid` and an integer `capacity` as input. It calculates the total number of times the buckets need to be lowered and returns the result.

In the `main`
