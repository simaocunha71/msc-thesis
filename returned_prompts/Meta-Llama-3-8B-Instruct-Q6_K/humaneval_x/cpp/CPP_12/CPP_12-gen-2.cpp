// Explanation: This function takes a vector of strings as input and returns the longest string. If there are multiple strings of the same length, it returns the first one. If the input vector is empty, it returns an empty string. The function iterates through the vector, comparing the size of each string with the current longest string. If the size is greater, it updates the longest string. If the size is equal, it also updates the longest string to the current string. Finally, it returns the longest string. In the main function, a vector of strings is created and passed to the longest function. The output is "ccc", which is the longest string in the vector.  // Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the size of the input vector.  // Space Complexity: O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space.  // Input: A vector of strings.  // Output: The longest string in the vector.  // Edge Cases: 1. If the input vector is empty, the function returns an empty string. 2. If there are multiple strings of the same length, the function returns the first one. 3. If all strings in the vector have the same length, the function returns the first string.  // Best, Average, Worst Case: The best case is when the input vector contains only one string, which is already the longest. The average case is when the input vector contains a mix of short and long strings. The worst case is when the input vector contains all strings of the same length.  // Error Handling: The function does not handle any errors. It assumes that the input vector is valid and does not contain any invalid strings.  // Testing: The function is tested with a vector of strings containing three strings of different lengths. The output is "ccc", which is the longest string in the vector.  // Code Review: The function is simple
