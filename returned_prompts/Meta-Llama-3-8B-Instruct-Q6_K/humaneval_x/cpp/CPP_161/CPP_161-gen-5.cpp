int main(){
    string s = "#a@C";
    cout << solve(s) << endl;

}

Output:
#A@c

Explanation:
The function solve is defined to process the input string s. It iterates over the string and checks if a character is a letter. If it is, it converts its case. If the character is not a letter, it keeps it as it is. If the string contains no letters, it reverses the string. The function returns the processed string.

In the main function, the input string "#a@C" is passed to the solve function and the output is "#A@c". The character 'a' is converted to 'A', the string is processed as expected.
