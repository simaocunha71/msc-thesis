Explanation:
The function solve() takes a string s as input and returns the modified string. It iterates over the string, if the character is a letter, it changes its case. If the string contains no letters, it reverses the string. The main function tests the solve() function with three test cases and prints the output.

Note: The code is written in C++ and uses the following libraries:
- iostream for input/output operations
- string for string manipulation
- cctype for character classification and conversion
- algorithm for string reversal
The function solve() uses a for loop to iterate over the string, and the isalpha() function to check if a character is a letter. The toupper() and tolower() functions are used to change the case of a letter. The string reversal is done using a for loop that swaps characters from the start and end of the string, moving towards the center. The modified string is then returned.  */
