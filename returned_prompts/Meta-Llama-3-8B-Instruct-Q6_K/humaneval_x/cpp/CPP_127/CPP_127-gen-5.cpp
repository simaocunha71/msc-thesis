    This program defines a function called intersection that takes two intervals (each represented by a pair of integers) as input. It checks if the intervals intersect, and if they do, it calculates the length of their intersection. Then, it checks if the length of the intersection is a prime number. If it is, the function returns "YES", otherwise it returns "NO". If the intervals do not intersect, the function returns "NO".

    The main function tests the intersection function with two intervals, {1, 3} and {2, 4}, and prints the result. The output is "NO", which is correct because the intervals do not intersect.

    The time complexity of the program is O(1) because it only performs a constant number of operations, regardless of the size of the input. The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the input and output.
