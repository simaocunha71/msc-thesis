**Explanation:**

The problem asks to find the number of even and odd integer palindromes within the range(1, n), inclusive. We can solve this by iterating through the range and checking each number if it's a palindrome. If it is, we increment the corresponding counter (even or odd).

The code uses a vector `result` to store the count of even and odd palindromes. We iterate through the range using a for loop, convert each number to a string, check if it's a palindrome using the `string(str.rbegin(), str.rend())` comparison, and increment the corresponding counter based on the parity of the number.

In the `main` function, we test the `even_odd_palindrome` function with `n = 12` and print the result.

**Time complexity:** O(n)

**Space complexity:** O(1) (excluding the output vector) or O(n) (including the output vector)

**Note:** The code assumes that the input `n` is a positive integer. If `n` can be negative or zero, additional checks need to be added. Also, the code uses the `to_string` function to convert integers to strings, which may not be the most efficient approach for large inputs. A more efficient approach would be to use a bit manipulation trick to check for palindromes. However, this code is simple and easy to understand.
