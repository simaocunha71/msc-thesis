Solution:
The time complexity of the given solution is O(n^2) where n is the number of elements in the vector. This is because there are two nested loops that traverse the entire vector.

We can improve the time complexity by sorting the vector first and then using two pointers to find the pair that sums to zero. This can be done in O(n log n) time.

Here is the improved solution:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

bool pairs_sum_to_zero(vector<int>& l) {
    sort(l.begin(), l.end());
    int left = 0, right = l.size() - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int sum = l[left] + l[right];
        if (sum == 0) {
            return true;
        } else if (sum < 0) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }
    return false;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> v = {2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7};
    if (pairs_sum_to_zero(v)) {
        cout << "There are two distinct elements in the vector that sum to zero.\n";
    } else {
        cout << "There are no two distinct elements in the vector that sum to zero.\n";
    }
    return 0;
}
```
This solution first sorts the vector in ascending order. Then it uses two pointers, `left` and `right`, to traverse the vector. The `left` pointer starts from the beginning of the vector, and the `right` pointer starts from the end of the vector. The algorithm checks the sum of the elements at the `left` and `right` pointers. If the sum is zero, it returns
