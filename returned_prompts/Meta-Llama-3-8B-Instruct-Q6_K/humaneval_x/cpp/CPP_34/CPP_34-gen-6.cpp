The problem is asking you to write a function that takes a vector of integers as input and returns a new vector containing the unique elements of the input vector, sorted in ascending order.
The function first sorts the input vector in ascending order. Then, it uses the `std::unique` algorithm to remove consecutive duplicates from the sorted vector. Finally, it returns the resulting vector.
In the `main` function, a sample vector `v` is created, and the `unique` function is called with `v` as the input. The resulting vector is then printed to the console.
The output will be: `0 2 3 5 9 123` which are the unique elements of the input vector in sorted order.

Here's the complete code with the main function:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

vector<int> unique(vector<int> l) {
    sort(l.begin(), l.end());
    l.erase(unique(l.begin(), l.end()), l.end());
    return l;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> v = {5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123};
    vector<int> result = unique(v);
    for (int i = 0; i < result.size(); i++) {
        cout << result[i] << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

When you run this code, it will output:

```
0 2 3 5 9 123
```


This code works by first sorting the vector, which ensures that any consecutive duplicates will be adjacent to each other. Then, it uses the `std::unique` algorithm to remove consecutive duplicates from the sorted vector. The `std::unique` algorithm returns an iterator pointing to the new end of the vector, which is then used to erase the remaining elements from the vector. Finally, the resulting vector is returned.
