Explanation:
The problem is asking to find the sum of all odd elements in even positions in a given vector of integers. In other words, we need to iterate through the vector, and if the index is even and the element at that index is odd, add it to the sum.

In the provided code, we use a for loop to iterate through the vector. We check if the index `i` is even (`i % 2 == 0`) and if the element at that index is odd (`lst[i] % 2 != 0`). If both conditions are true, we add the element to the sum. Finally, we return the sum.

In the main function, we test the solution with three different vectors and print the results. The output should be 12 for the first vector, 9 for the second vector, and 0 for the third vector.
