The code provided defines a function `solutions` that takes a vector of integers as input and returns the sum of all odd elements that are in even positions.

Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

1. The function `solutions` is defined with a parameter `lst` of type `vector<int>`.
2. An integer variable `sum` is initialized to 0, which will be used to store the sum of the odd elements in even positions.
3. A `for` loop is used to iterate over the elements of the input vector `lst`.
4. Inside the loop, the condition `i % 2 == 0` checks if the current position `i` is even.
5. The condition `lst[i] % 2 != 0` checks if the element at the current position is odd.
6. If both conditions are true, it means that the element is in an even position and is odd, so it is added to the `sum`.
7. The function returns the value of `sum`.

In the `main` function, a vector `lst` is created and initialized with the values {5, 8, 7, 1}. The `solutions` function is called with this vector as input, and the result is printed to the console.

The output of the program will be `12`, which is the sum of the odd elements in even positions in the input vector: 5 (at position 0) and 1 (at position 3).
