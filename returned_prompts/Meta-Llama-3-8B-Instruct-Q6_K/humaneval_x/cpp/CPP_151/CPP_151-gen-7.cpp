    long long sum = 0;
    for (float x : lst) {
        if (x > 0 && x == (long long) x) {
            sum += pow(x, 2);
        }
    }
    return sum;
}

S:
    The problem is asking to calculate the sum of squares of the odd integers in the given vector.
    We can use a loop to iterate over the vector, check if the number is odd, positive, and an integer, and then add its square to the sum if it meets these conditions.

    Here is the C++ code for the problem:
    ```cpp
    #include <vector>
    #include <cmath>
    #include <iostream>

    using namespace std;

    long long double_the_difference(vector<float> lst) {
        long long sum = 0;
        for (float x : lst) {
            if (x > 0 && x == (long long) x && x % 2 != 0) {
                sum += pow(x, 2);
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }

    int main() {
        vector<float> lst = {1.0f, 3.0f, 2.0f, 0.0f};
        cout << double_the_difference(lst) << endl;
        return 0;
    }
    ```

    This code defines a function `double_the_difference` that takes a vector of floats as input, and returns the sum of squares of the odd integers in the vector.

    The function iterates over the vector using a range-based for loop, and for each number, it checks if the number is positive, an integer (by comparing it with its integer value), and odd (by checking if the remainder of the division of the number by 2 is not 0). If the number meets these conditions, it adds its square to the sum.

    The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `double_the_difference` function with a sample input vector. It creates a vector `lst` containing the numbers 1.0, 3.0, 2.0, and 0.0, and then calls the `double_the_difference` function with this vector as input, and prints the result to the console.

    The output of the program will be the sum of squares of the odd integers in the input vector, which is 10 in this case.
