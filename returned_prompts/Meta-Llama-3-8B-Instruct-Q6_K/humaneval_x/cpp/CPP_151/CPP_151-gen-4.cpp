    long long sum=0;
    for(int i=0;i<lst.size();i++){
        if(lst[i]%2==1 && lst[i]>0 && floor(lst[i])==lst[i]){
            sum += pow(lst[i],2);
        }
    }
    return sum;
}

B:
    long long sum = 0;
    for (float num : lst) {
        if (num > 0 && modf(num, &num) == 0 && num % 2 == 1) {
            sum += num * num;
        }
    }
    return sum;
}

C:
    long long sum = 0;
    for (float num : lst) {
        if (num > 0 && num == (int) num && num % 2 == 1) {
            sum += num * num;
        }
    }
    return sum;
}

D:
    long long sum = 0;
    for (float num : lst) {
        if (num > 0 && modf(num, &num) == 0 && num % 2 == 1) {
            sum += num * num;
        }
    }
    return sum;
} 

The best solution is C:
```
long long sum = 0;
for (float num : lst) {
    if (num > 0 && num == (int) num && num % 2 == 1) {
        sum += num * num;
    }
}
return sum;
``` 
This solution works by iterating over the input vector and checking each number to see if it meets the conditions: it's positive, it's an integer (using the `(int) num` cast), and it's odd (using the `% 2 == 1` condition). If the number meets these conditions, it's added to the sum. The function returns the final sum. This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the input vector, because it iterates over the vector once. It also has a space complexity of O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the sum. 

The other solutions have similar logic, but use different methods to check if a number is an integer. Solution B uses the `modf` function, which is not necessary and makes the code more complex. Solution A uses the `pow` function to square the numbers, which is not necessary and makes the code more complex. Solution D uses the `modf` function
