C:
This C++ code implements a function named `count_up_to` that takes an integer `n` and returns a vector of the first `n` integers that are prime numbers and less than `n`. The function uses a nested loop to check each integer for primality. The outer loop iterates from 2 to `n-1`, and the inner loop checks if the current integer is divisible by any integer up to its square root. If it is not divisible, it is a prime number and is added to the vector.

The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `count_up_to` function by printing the size of the returned vector for `n = 5`.

Note: The `count_up_to` function returns an empty vector for `n = 0` or `n = 1` as there are no prime numbers less than or equal to 0 or 1. For `n = 20`, the function returns the vector `{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19}`. For `n = 18`, the function returns the vector `{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17}`. For `n = 1`, the function returns an empty vector. For `n = 0`, the function also returns an empty vector.
