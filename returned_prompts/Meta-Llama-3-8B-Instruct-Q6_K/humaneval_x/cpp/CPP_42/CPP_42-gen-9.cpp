    vector<int> result;
    for(int i=0; i<l.size(); i++){
        result.push_back(l[i]+1);
    }
    return result;
} 

B:
    vector<int> result;
    for(int i=0; i<l.size(); i++){
        result.push_back(l[i]+1);
    }
    return result;

C:
    for(int i=0; i<l.size(); i++){
        l[i]++;
    }
    return l;

D:
    vector<int> result;
    for(int i=0; i<l.size(); i++){
        result.push_back(l[i]+1);
    }
    return result;

Correct Answer: B

Explanation: This is a simple question that tests the candidate's knowledge of vector and loop manipulation in C++. The problem is asking to create a function that takes a vector of integers as an input and returns a new vector where each element is incremented by 1.

Option B is the correct answer. It uses a for loop to iterate over the elements of the input vector, increments each element by 1, and stores the result in a new vector. The function then returns this new vector.

Option C is incorrect because it modifies the original vector instead of creating a new one. Option D is also incorrect because it returns the original vector instead of the modified one. Option A is incorrect because it does not specify how the elements of the vector are incremented.
