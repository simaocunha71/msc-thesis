C:
The output of the program is:

2 3 4

Explanation:
The program defines a function incr_list that takes a vector of integers as input, increments each element by 1, and returns the resulting vector.

The main function creates a vector v containing the elements {1, 2, 3}. It then calls the incr_list function with v as input and assigns the result to a new vector result. Finally, it prints the elements of the result vector. The output is {2, 3, 4}, which is the result of incrementing each element of the original vector by 1.
