S:
The function `fibfib(int n)` efficiently computes the n-th element of the fibfib number sequence. It uses a simple iterative approach to calculate the sequence. The base cases are handled separately for `n <= 1` and `n == 2`. For `n > 2`, the function initializes three variables `a`, `b`, and `c` to store the previous three elements of the sequence. It then enters a loop that iterates from 3 to `n`, updating the variables to calculate the next element in the sequence. The final value of `c` is returned as the n-th element of the fibfib number sequence. The time complexity of this function is O(n), making it efficient for large values of `n`. 

For example, when `n = 5`, the function returns `4`, which is the correct value for the 5th element of the fibfib number sequence. Similarly, when `n = 8`, the function returns `24`, which is the correct value for the 8th element of the fibfib number sequence. 

The code is written in C++ and uses the `printf` function to print the result. The `main` function is used to test the `fibfib` function with `n = 5`. 

Note that this implementation is not memoized, which means it recalculates the sequence from scratch for each call. If you need to compute multiple values of the sequence, it may be more efficient to use a memoized implementation or a more advanced algorithm. 

Also, the code uses `using namespace std;` which is generally discouraged in C++ because it can lead to naming conflicts. It's better to use the `std::` prefix to access standard library functions and classes. 

Here's the corrected code without using namespace std:

```cpp
#include<stdio.h>

int fibfib(int n){
    if(n <= 1) return 0;
    if(n == 2) return 1
