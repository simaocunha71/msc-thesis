C:
The provided C++ code defines a function `rolling_max` that takes a vector of integers as input and returns a new vector containing the rolling maximum elements found until each moment in the sequence. The function uses a loop to iterate over the input vector, and for each element, it checks if the current element is greater than the maximum found so far. If it is, the maximum is updated. The updated maximum is then added to the result vector. The function returns the result vector.

In the `main` function, a test vector `numbers` is created with the values {1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2}. The `rolling_max` function is called with this vector as input, and the result is stored in the `result` vector. The `result` vector is then printed to the console.

The output of the program is:
```
1 2 3 3 3 4 4
```
This is the rolling maximum sequence for the input vector. Each element in the result vector represents the maximum element found until that moment in the input sequence.
