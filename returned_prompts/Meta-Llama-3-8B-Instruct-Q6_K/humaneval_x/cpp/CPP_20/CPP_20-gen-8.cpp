C++ code that finds two numbers in a given vector that are closest to each other and returns them as a vector of two floats. The function first initializes a variable `min_diff` to store the minimum difference between any two numbers in the vector. It then iterates over the vector, calculating the absolute difference between each pair of numbers. If the calculated difference is less than `min_diff`, it updates `min_diff` and stores the pair of numbers in a result vector. Finally, it returns the result vector.

The code uses the `numeric_limits` class from the `<limits>` library to initialize `min_diff` to a large value, ensuring that the first pair of numbers encountered will have a difference less than `min_diff`. The `abs` function from the `<cmath>` library is used to calculate the absolute difference between two numbers.

The function takes a vector of floats as input and returns a vector of two floats as output. It uses the `using namespace std;` directive to bring the `std` namespace into scope, allowing it to use the `vector` and `numeric_limits` classes without qualifying them with the `std::` prefix.

The provided test cases demonstrate the function's behavior:
```cpp
int main() {
    vector<float> numbers1 = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2};
    vector<float> result1 = find_closest_elements(numbers1);
    cout << "(" << result1[0] << ", " << result1[1] << ")" << endl;

    vector<float> numbers2 = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0};
    vector<float> result2 = find_closest_elements(numbers2);
    cout << "(" << result2[0] << ", " << result2[1] << ")" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
Output:
