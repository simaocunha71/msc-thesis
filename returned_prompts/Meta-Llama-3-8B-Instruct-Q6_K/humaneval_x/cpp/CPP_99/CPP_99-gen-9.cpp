    double num = stod(value);
    double floor_num = floor(num);
    double ceil_num = ceil(num);

    }
}

B:
    double num = stod(value);
    int integer = (int)round(num);
    return integer;
}

C:
    double num = stod(value);
    int integer = (int)(num >= 0 ? ceil(num) : floor(num));
    return integer;
}

D:
    double num = stod(value);
    int integer = (int)(round(num));
    if (num - integer > 0.5) {
        return integer + 1;
    } else {
        return integer;
    }
}

E:
    double num = stod(value);
    int integer = (int)(num >= 0 ? ceil(num) : floor(num));
    return integer;
}

F:
    double num = stod(value);
    int integer = (int)(round(num));
    return integer;
}[/code]

Correct Answer: E:
    double num = stod(value);
    int integer = (int)(num >= 0 ? ceil(num) : floor(num));
    return integer;
}

Explanation: This solution uses the ternary operator to determine whether to round up or down. If the number is positive, it rounds up using the `ceil` function. If the number is negative, it rounds down using the `floor` function. This ensures that the number is rounded away from zero when it is equidistant from two integers. [/code]

Note: The original problem statement was not entirely clear, but based on the provided examples and the desired behavior, it seems that rounding away from zero is the intended behavior. [/code]
