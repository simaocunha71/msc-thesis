Explanation:
This is a simple C++ program that defines a function `add` that takes two integers as arguments and returns their sum. The function is then called twice in the `main` function with different arguments, and the results are printed to the console. The `using namespace std;` line is used to import the `std` namespace, which contains the `printf` function. The `#include` directives are used to include the necessary header files for input/output operations (`stdio.h`) and for using standard library functions (`stdlib.h`). The `return 0;` line at the end of the `main` function indicates successful program termination. The `int` keyword is used to declare the `add` function and the `main` function as integer-returning functions. The `printf` function is used to print the results to the console, and the `%d` format specifier is used to specify that the output should be an integer. The `add` function is called with the arguments `2` and `3`, and then with the arguments `5` and `7`, and the results are printed to the console. The `main` function returns an integer value, which is 0 in this case, indicating successful program termination. The `A:` label is not actually used in this program, but it is included to match the format of the original question. The `>>>` symbols are also not used in this program, as they are typically used in Python to indicate interactive shell input and output.
