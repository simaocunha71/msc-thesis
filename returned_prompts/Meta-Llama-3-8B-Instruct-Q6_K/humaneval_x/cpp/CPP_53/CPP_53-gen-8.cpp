    int sum=x+y;
    return sum;
}
int main() {
    printf("%d\n",add(2,3));
    printf("%d\n",add(5,7));

Output:

Explanation:
The code is a C++ program that defines a function called `add` which takes two integer parameters `x` and `y`, and returns their sum. The function is then called from the `main` function with two sets of arguments (2, 3) and (5, 7), and the results are printed to the console. The `using namespace std;` line is used to avoid having to prefix standard library functions with `std::`. The `printf` function is used to print the results to the console. The `%d` format specifier is used to print integers. The `return 0;` line at the end of the `main` function indicates that the program has executed successfully.
