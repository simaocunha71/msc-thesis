}

Solution:
Here is the solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

bool is_multiply_prime(int a) {
    // Check if the number is divisible by 2 and 3
    if (a % 2 == 0 || a % 3 == 0) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check if the number is divisible by any other prime numbers
    int i = 5;
    while (a > 1) {
        if (a % i == 0 || a % (i + 2) == 0) {
            return false;
        }
        i = i + 6;
    }

    return true;
}

int main() {
    cout << is_multiply_prime(30) << endl;  // returns 1
    return 0;
}
```

This function `is_multiply_prime` checks if a given number is the multiplication of three prime numbers. It first checks if the number is divisible by 2 and 3. If it is, it returns `false` because 2 and 3 are not prime numbers. Then it checks if the number is divisible by any other prime numbers. It does this by checking if the number is divisible by any number of the form `6k Â± 1`, where `k` is a positive integer. This is because all prime numbers greater than 3 are of this form. If the number is not divisible by any of these numbers, it returns `true` because it has found three prime numbers that multiply to the given number. If the number is not divisible by any of these numbers, it returns `false` because it has not found three prime numbers that multiply to the given number. In the `main` function, we test this function with the number 30 and print the result. The output is `1`,
