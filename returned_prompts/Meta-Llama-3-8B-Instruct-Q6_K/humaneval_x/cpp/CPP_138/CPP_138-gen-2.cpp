    This method sums up the even numbers from 2 to n and checks if the sum is equal to n. It breaks the loop as soon as the sum exceeds n.

B:
    This method is similar to A but it checks if the sum is equal to n after adding each even number.

C:
    This method subtracts each even number from n and checks if n becomes 0. If it does, then n can be written as the sum of 4 even numbers.

D:
    This method sums up the even numbers from 2 to n and checks if the sum is equal to n. It does not break the loop if the sum exceeds n.

E:
    This method subtracts each even number from n and checks if n becomes 0. It breaks the loop as soon as n becomes less than 0.

The correct answer is C.
Explanation:
The problem asks whether the given number n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. We can solve this problem by subtracting each even number from n and checking if n becomes 0. If it does, then n can be written as the sum of 4 even numbers
