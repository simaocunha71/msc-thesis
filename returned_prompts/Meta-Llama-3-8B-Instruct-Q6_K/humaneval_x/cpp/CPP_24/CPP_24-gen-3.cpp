    int i;
    for(i=n-1;i>0;i--){
        if(n%i==0){
            return i;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}

int main(){
    int n;
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d",&n);
    printf("Largest divisor is: %d\n", largest_divisor(n));
    return 0;
}

Solution:
The problem is asking to find the largest number that divides a given number n evenly, smaller than n.

In the given code, the function `largest_divisor` takes an integer n as input and returns the largest divisor of n smaller than n.

The code iterates from n-1 down to 1 and checks if the current number is a divisor of n by using the modulus operator `%`. If the remainder is 0, it means the current number is a divisor of n, and the function returns the current number.

In the main function, the user is prompted to enter a number, and the `largest_divisor` function is called with the entered number as input. The result is then printed to the console.

For example, if the user enters 15, the output will be "Largest divisor is: 5", which is the largest number that divides 15 evenly, smaller than 15.

Here is the corrected code:

```cpp
#include<stdio.h>
using namespace std;
int largest_divisor(int n){
    int i;
    for(i=n-1;i>0;i--){
        if(n%i==0){
            return i;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}

int main(){
    int n;
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d",&n);
    printf("Largest divisor is: %d\n", largest_divisor(n));
    return 0;
}
```



The above code is a correct implementation of the problem. It iterates from n-1 down to 1 and checks if the current number is a divisor of n. If it is, it returns the current number as the largest divisor. If no divisor is found, it returns 0. The main function prompts the user to enter a number and prints the largest divisor of the entered number.
