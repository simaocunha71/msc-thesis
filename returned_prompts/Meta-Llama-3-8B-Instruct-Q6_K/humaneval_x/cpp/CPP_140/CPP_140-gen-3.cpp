```c
#include <string>
using namespace std;

string fix_spaces(string text) {
    int i = 0;
    while(i < text.length()) {
        if(text[i] == ' ' && i+1 < text.length() && text[i+1] == ' ') {
            i++;
            continue;
        }
        if(text[i] == ' ') {
            text.replace(i, 1, "_");
            i++;
        } else {
            i++;

This solution correctly replaces all spaces with underscores and more than 2 consecutive spaces with a hyphen. 

Solution B, C, D, E, F, and G are incorrect because they do not handle the case of more than 2 consecutive spaces correctly. 

Solution B tries to replace all spaces with underscores, but it does not handle the case of more than 2 consecutive spaces. 

Solution C tries to replace 2 consecutive spaces with a hyphen, but it does not handle the case of more than 2 consecutive spaces. 

Solution D tries to replace 3 consecutive spaces with a hyphen, but it does not handle the case of more than 3 consecutive spaces. 

Solution E tries to replace 2 consecutive spaces
