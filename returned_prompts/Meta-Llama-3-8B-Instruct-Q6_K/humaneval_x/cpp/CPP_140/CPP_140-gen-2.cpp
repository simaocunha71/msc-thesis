In this solution, we iterate through the string. If we encounter a space, we check if the previous character is also a space. If it is, we replace all consecutive spaces with a single '-'. If not, we replace the space with an underscore. We use the `insert` function to insert the character or string at the current position in the string. We also keep track of the current position `j` to know where to insert the characters. Finally, we return the modified string. In the `main` function, we test the `fix_spaces` function with the string "Example   3". The output should be "_Example-3". 

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because we are iterating through the string once. The space complexity is also O(n), as we are creating a new string to store the modified string. 

The function `fix_spaces` is used to replace all the spaces in the given string with underscores and if there are more than 2 consecutive spaces then replace them with a single '-'. The function `main` is used to test the `fix_spaces` function. The string "Example   3" is passed to the `fix_spaces` function and the result is printed.  The output will be "_Example-3".  The code is written in C++.  



This code will replace all spaces in the string with underscores and if there are more than 2 consecutive spaces then replace them with a single '-'. This is achieved by iterating through the string and checking if the current character is a space. If it is, we check if the previous character is also a space. If it is, we replace all consecutive spaces with a single '-'. If not, we
