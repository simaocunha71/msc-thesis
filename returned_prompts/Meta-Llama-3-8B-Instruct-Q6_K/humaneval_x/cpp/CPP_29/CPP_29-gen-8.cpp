Output:
abc
vector


Explanation: 
This code defines a function `filter_by_prefix` that takes a vector of strings and a prefix as input. It iterates over the input vector and checks if each string starts with the given prefix using the `find` method. If it does, the string is added to a new vector `result`. The function returns the `result` vector.

In the `main` function, we create a vector of strings `strings` and a prefix `prefix`. We call the `filter_by_prefix` function with these inputs and store the result in the `result` variable. We then print each string in the `result` vector using a loop.

The output shows that the function correctly filters the input vector and returns only the strings that start with the given prefix. In this case, the output is `{"abc", "vector"}`.
