In this C++ code, we define a function `filter_by_prefix` that filters a vector of strings based on a given prefix. The function iterates over each string in the input vector and checks if the string starts with the given prefix using the `find` method. If the string starts with the prefix, it is added to the result vector. The function returns the filtered vector.

In the `main` function, we create a vector of strings, a prefix, and call the `filter_by_prefix` function with these inputs. The filtered vector is then printed to the console.

Note that this code uses the `std::vector` class from the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) to represent the input vector and the result vector. It also uses the `std::string` class to represent individual strings. The `using namespace std;` directive is used to avoid qualifying the `std` namespace with the `std::` prefix.
