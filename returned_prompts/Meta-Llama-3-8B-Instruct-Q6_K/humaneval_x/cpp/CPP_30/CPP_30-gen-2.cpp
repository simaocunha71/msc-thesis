Explanation:
This is a C++ program that defines a function `get_positive` which takes a vector of floating point numbers as input and returns a new vector containing only the positive numbers from the input vector. The function iterates over the input vector, checks if each element is greater than 0, and if so, adds it to the result vector. The main function demonstrates the usage of `get_positive` by creating an input vector, calling `get_positive` with it, and then printing the result. The output is a vector containing the positive numbers from the input vector, which are 2, 5, and 6 in this case.

Note: The `get_positive` function is not using any advanced features of C++ or any external libraries, it's a simple and straightforward implementation. The use of `using namespace std;` is not recommended in real-world code, but it's allowed for simplicity in this example. In a real-world scenario, you would typically use the `std::` prefix for standard library functions and types.
