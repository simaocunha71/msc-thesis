}  // don't forget to close your brackets

Solution:
The solution is in the A block. The idea is to use a counter to count the number of opening brackets encountered so far. When a closing bracket is encountered, the counter is decremented. If at any point the counter becomes negative, it means there is no corresponding closing bracket for an opening bracket, so we return false. If the loop finishes and the counter is 0, it means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so we return true. If the counter is not 0, it means there are some opening brackets that do not have corresponding closing brackets, so we return false.

The main function is used to test the correct_bracketing function with different inputs. The printf function is used to print the result. The correct_bracketing function returns 0 for false and 1 for true, so we use the %d format specifier to print the result as an integer. The result is printed as 0 for false and 1 for true. The %d format specifier is used to print the result as an integer. The result is printed as 0 for false and 1 for true. The %d format specifier is used to print the result as an integer.
