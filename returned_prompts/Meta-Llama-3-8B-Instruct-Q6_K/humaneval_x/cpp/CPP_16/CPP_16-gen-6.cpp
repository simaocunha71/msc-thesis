The `count_distinct_characters` function in this code counts the number of distinct characters in a given string. It does this by using a `map` to store the frequency of each character in the string. The string is converted to lowercase to make the comparison case-insensitive. The function then returns the size of the `map`, which represents the number of distinct characters in the string.

In the `main` function, a string "xyzXYZ" is used to test the `count_distinct_characters` function. The output will be "Number of distinct characters in string "xyzXYZ" is 3", which is the correct number of distinct characters in the string.

The code is written in C++ and uses the `map` data structure from the `<map>` library to store the frequency of each character. The `string` class from the `<string>` library is used to represent the input string. The `cout` statement in the `main` function is used to print the output to the console.
