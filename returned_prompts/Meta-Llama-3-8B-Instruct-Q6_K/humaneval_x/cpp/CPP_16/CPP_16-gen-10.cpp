Explanation:
The task is to count the number of distinct characters in a given string. To do this, we create a vector of unique characters. We loop through the string, convert each character to lowercase, and check if it's already in the vector. If not, we add it to the vector. At the end, we return the size of the vector, which is the number of distinct characters.

In the code, we use the `tolower` function to convert each character to lowercase, so that uppercase and lowercase letters are considered the same. We use the `find` function to check if a character is already in the vector, and if not, we use the `push_back` function to add it to the vector.

In the `main` function, we test the `count_distinct_characters` function with two example strings, "xyzXYZ" and "Jerry". The output is the number of distinct characters in each string. 

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because we loop through the string once and perform a constant amount of work for each character. The space complexity is also O(n), because in the worst case, we might need to store all characters in the vector. 

The output of the code is:
```
3
4
```
which are the number of distinct characters in the two input strings. 

The code can be further optimized by using a set instead of a vector to store unique characters. A set automatically removes duplicates, so we don't need to check if a character is already in the set. However, this would change the time complexity of the solution to O(n log n) due to the overhead of set operations. 

Here is the optimized version of the code:
```cpp
int count_distinct_characters(string str){ 
    set<char> unique_chars;
    for(int i=0; i<str.length(); i
