S:
The problem asks for the product of the unit digits of two given integers. 

Here's how you can solve this problem in C:

```c
#include<stdio.h>
using namespace std;
int multiply(int a,int b){
    int unit_a=a%10;
    int unit_b=b%10;
    int product=unit_a*unit_b;
    return product;
}

int main()
{
    int a,b;
    printf("Enter the first number: ");
    scanf("%d",&a);
    printf("Enter the second number: ");
    scanf("%d",&b);
    int result=multiply(a,b);
    printf("The product of the unit digits is: %d\n",result);
    return 0;
}
```

This program first takes two integers as input from the user. Then, it calculates the unit digit of each number using the modulus operator (`%`). It multiplies these unit digits together and returns the product. The result is then printed to the console. 

The function `multiply` calculates the product of the unit digits of two integers. It takes two integers `a` and `b` as input, calculates their unit digits using `a%10` and `b%10`, and returns the product of these unit digits. 

The `main` function is the entry point of the program. It takes two integers as input from the user, calls the `multiply` function to calculate the product of their unit digits, and prints the result to the console. 

The output of this program will be the product of the unit digits of the two input numbers. For example, if the user inputs `148` and `412`, the output will be `16`, which is the product of the unit digits `8` and `2`. 

This program assumes that the input is always valid, i.e., the user will enter two integers. It does not perform any error checking or handling. In a real-world application, you would want to add error checking to handle invalid input
