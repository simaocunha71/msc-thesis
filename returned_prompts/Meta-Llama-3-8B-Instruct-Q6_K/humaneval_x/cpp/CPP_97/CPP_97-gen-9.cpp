Answer:
The correct answer is A, B, C, D, E. All the codes given are correct.

Explanation:
The problem is asking to find the product of the unit digits of two given integers. The unit digit of a number can be found by taking the remainder of the number when divided by 10. 

In the given codes, the unit digits are found by taking the remainder of the numbers 'a' and 'b' when divided by 10, and then the product of these unit digits is returned. This is a valid and efficient solution for the problem. 

All the given codes are correct and will produce the same output, which is the product of the unit digits of the given integers. Therefore, the answer is A, B, C, D, E.
