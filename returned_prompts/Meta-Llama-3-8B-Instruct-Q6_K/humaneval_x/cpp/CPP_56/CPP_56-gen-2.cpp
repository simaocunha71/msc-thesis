C++:
The program counts the opening and closing brackets as it iterates through the string. If the count of opening brackets exceeds the count of closing brackets at any point, it returns false. If the count of opening brackets does not match the count of closing brackets at the end of the string, it also returns false. Otherwise, it returns true, indicating that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. It then uses these functions in a main function to test the correct_bracketing function.
