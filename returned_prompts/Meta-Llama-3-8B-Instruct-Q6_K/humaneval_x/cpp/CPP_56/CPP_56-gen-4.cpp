    The function takes a string as an input and checks if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. It counts the number of opening brackets and then checks if the count becomes zero at the end. If the count is not zero, it means that there are some opening brackets which do not have corresponding closing brackets. So, it returns false. Otherwise, it returns true. This function correctly implements the problem as per the given test cases. The main function calls this function with different test cases and prints the result. The output matches the expected results.
C:
    Corrected the code as per the given test cases. The function now correctly checks if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. The main function calls this function with different test cases and prints the result. The output matches the expected results. The function correctly implements the problem as per the given test cases. It takes a string as an input and checks if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. It counts the number of opening brackets and then checks if the count becomes zero at the end. If the count is not zero, it means that there are some opening brackets which do not have corresponding closing brackets. So, it returns false. Otherwise, it returns true. The function is efficient and easy to understand. It correctly implements the problem as per the given test cases. The output matches the expected results.
