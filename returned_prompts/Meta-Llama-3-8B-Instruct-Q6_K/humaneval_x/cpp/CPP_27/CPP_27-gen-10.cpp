The C code provided is a simple program that flips the case of each character in a given string. It takes a string as input, iterates through each character, and checks if the character is lowercase or uppercase using ASCII values. If the character is lowercase, it subtracts 32 from the ASCII value to make it uppercase. If the character is uppercase, it adds 32 to the ASCII value to make it lowercase.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. `void flip_case(char *str)`: This function takes a pointer to a string as input.
2. `int i = 0;`: This variable is used to iterate through each character in the string.
3. `while (str[i] != '\0')`: This loop iterates through each character in the string until it reaches the null character (`'\0'`).
4. `if (str[i] >= 'a' && str[i] <= 'z')`: This condition checks if the current character is lowercase.
5. `str[i] = str[i] - 32;`: If the character is lowercase, this line subtracts 32
