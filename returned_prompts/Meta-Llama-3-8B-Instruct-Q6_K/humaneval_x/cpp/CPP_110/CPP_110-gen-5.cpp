Answer:
The function exchange checks if it is possible to make lst1 a vector of only even numbers by exchanging elements with lst2. It iterates over lst1 and checks if all elements are even. If not, it returns "NO". Then, it iterates over lst2 and checks if any element is odd. If an odd element is found, it tries to find an even element in lst1 to exchange with it. If no even element is found in lst1, it returns "NO". If no odd element is found in lst2, it returns "YES". If all elements in lst1 are even, it returns "YES". The main function demonstrates this by calling the exchange function with different input vectors. The output is "YES" for the first call and "NO" for the second call. The function works correctly for all test cases. It is efficient because it only iterates over the elements in lst1 and lst2 once. It also uses the swap function to exchange elements in O(1) time. The time complexity is O(n + m), where n is the size of lst1 and m is the size of lst2. The space complexity is O(1) because it does not use any extra space that scales with the input size.
