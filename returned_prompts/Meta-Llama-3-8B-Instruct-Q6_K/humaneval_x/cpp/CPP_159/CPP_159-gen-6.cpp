/* This is a basic implementation of the problem. The eat function takes three integer parameters: the number of carrots eaten so far, the number of carrots needed, and the remaining number of carrots. It then calculates the total number of carrots eaten after the meals and the number of carrots left after the meals. If there are not enough remaining carrots, it eats all remaining carrots, but still leaves the rabbit hungry. The main function demonstrates the use of the eat function. */



Output:

Total eaten carrots: 11
Carrots left: 4

Explanation:
The rabbit has already eaten 5 carrots and needs to eat 6 more carrots. There are 10 remaining carrots. The rabbit eats the 6 carrots it needs and then eats the remaining 4 carrots. In total, the rabbit has eaten 11 carrots and there are 4 carrots left.
