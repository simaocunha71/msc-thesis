int main() {
    int number = 5;
    int need = 6;
    int remaining = 10;
    vector<int> result = eat(number, need, remaining);
    printf("Total eaten: %d\n", result[0]);
    printf("Carrots left: %d\n", result[1]);

    return 0;
}

Output:
Total eaten: 11
Carrots left: 4

Explanation:
The total number of eaten carrots is 5 (initial number of carrots eaten) + 6 (number of carrots needed) = 11.
The number of carrots left after eating is 10 (remaining carrots) - (6 - 5) = 10 - 1 = 9. Since the remaining carrots are less than the number of carrots needed, we eat all the remaining carrots. So, the number of carrots left is 9. But, the rabbit is still hungry because there are not enough carrots to satisfy its hunger. Therefore, we return {11, 4} as the result.
