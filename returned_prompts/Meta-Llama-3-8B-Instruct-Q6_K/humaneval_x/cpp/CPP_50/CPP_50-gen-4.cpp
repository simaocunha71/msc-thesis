The code provided seems to be a simple Caesar cipher implementation in C++ where every character in the input string is shifted by 5 positions in the alphabet. 

Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

1. `encode_shift(string s)`:
   - It iterates over each character in the input string `s`.
   - For each character, it calculates the new character by adding 5 to the ASCII value of the character (assuming the character is a lowercase letter 'a' to 'z').
   - If the result is greater than the ASCII value of 'z', it wraps around to the beginning of the alphabet by taking the modulus with 26 (the number of letters in the alphabet).
   - The new character is then added to the output string.

2. `decode_shift(string s)`:
   - It is the inverse operation of `encode_shift`.
   - It also iterates over each character in the input string `s`.
   - For each character, it calculates the original character by subtracting 5 from the ASCII value of the character (assuming the character is a lowercase letter 'a' to 'z').
   - If the result is less than the ASCII value of 'a', it wraps around to the end of the alphabet by taking the modulus with 26.
   - The original character is then added to the output string.

Here's a sample usage of these functions:

```cpp
int main() {
    string input = "hello";
    string encoded = encode_shift(input);
    cout << "Encoded: " << encoded << endl;

    string decoded = decode_shift(encoded);
    cout << "Decoded: " << decoded << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code will output:

```
Encoded: mjqqt
Decoded: hello
```

This shows that the Caesar cipher successfully encoded and decoded the input string.
