The problem is asking you to write two functions, `encode_shift` and `decode_shift`, which are used to shift each character in a string by 5 positions in the alphabet.

The `encode_shift` function takes a string as input and returns the encoded string by shifting every character by 5 positions in the alphabet. The function uses the ASCII values of the characters to perform the shift.

The `decode_shift` function takes a string as input, which is the output of the `encode_shift` function, and returns the decoded string by shifting each character back by 5 positions in the alphabet.

Here is the solution:

```c++
#include<stdio.h>
#include<string>
using namespace std;
string encode_shift(string s){
    // returns encoded string by shifting every character by 5 in the alphabet.
    string out;
    int i;
    for (i=0;i<s.length();i++)
    {
        int w=((int)s[i]+5-(int)'a')%26+(int)'a';   
        out=out+(char)w;
    }
    return out;
}
string decode_shift(string s){
    // takes as input string encoded with encode_shift function. Returns decoded string.
    string out;
    int i;
    for (i=0;i<s.length();i++)
    {
        int w=((int)s[i]-5-(int)'a')%26+(int)'a';   
        out=out+(char)w;
    }
    return out;
}
int main() {
    string s = "hello";
    string encoded = encode_shift(s);
    cout << "Encoded: " << encoded << endl;
    string decoded = decode_shift(encoded);
    cout << "Decoded: " << decoded << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In the `encode_shift` function, we iterate over each character in the input string. For each character, we calculate its new ASCII value by adding 5 to its current value, taking the modulus with 26 (the number of letters in the alphabet), and then subtracting the ASCII value of 'a' to ensure the result is within the range of lowercase letters. We then convert this new ASCII value back to a character and add it to the output string.

In the `decode_shift` function, we do the same thing as in the `encode_shift` function, but we subtract 5 instead of adding 5 to get the original character back.

In the `main` function, we test the `encode_shift` and `decode
