S:
You can calculate the area of a triangle using the formula `0.5 * base * height`. In your case, the base is the length of the side and the height is the height of the triangle.

Here is the correct Python code to calculate the area of the triangle:

```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    return 0.5 * a * h
```

In this code, `a` is the length of the side and `h` is the height of the triangle. The function `triangle_area` returns the area of the triangle.

You can use this function to calculate the area of a triangle in Python. For example:

```python
print(triangle_area(5, 3))  # Output: 7.5
```

This will calculate the area of a triangle with a side length of 5 and a height of 3 and print the result.
