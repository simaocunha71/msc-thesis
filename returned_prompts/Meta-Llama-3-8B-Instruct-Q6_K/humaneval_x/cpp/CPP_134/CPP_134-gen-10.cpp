This program will check if the last character of the given string is an alphabetical character and not a part of a word. It will return true if the last character is an alphabetical character and not a part of a word, and false otherwise. 

The function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` takes a string as an argument and checks if the last character of the string is an alphabetical character and not a part of a word. It uses the `isalpha` function from the `cctype` library to check if the last character is an alphabetical character, and the `back` function from the `string` library to get the last character of the string. It also checks if the last character is not a space character to ensure that it is not a part of a word. If the last character is an alphabetical character and not a part of a word, the function returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

In the main function, we call the `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` function with different strings and print the result. The output will be 0 for "apple pie" and "apple pi e ", 1 for "apple pi e ", and 0 for an empty string. 

This program demonstrates how to use the `isalpha` function and the `back` function to check the last character of a string, and how to use a conditional statement to return a boolean value based on the result of the check. It also shows how to call a function with different arguments and print the result.
