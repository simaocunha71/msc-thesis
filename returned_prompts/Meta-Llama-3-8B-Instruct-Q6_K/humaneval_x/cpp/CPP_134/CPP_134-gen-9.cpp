Code Explanation: 
In this code, we define a function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` that takes a string `txt` as an argument. The function first checks if the string is empty. If it is, the function returns `false`.

Next, it checks if the last character of the string is an alphabetical character using the `isalpha` function from the `<cctype>` library. If the last character is not alphabetical, the function returns `false`.

Then, it checks if the last character is a part of a word by finding the index of the last character in the string using the `find` function. If the last character is not the last character of the string (i.e., it is part of a word), the function returns `false`.

If the last character is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, the function returns `true`.

In the `main` function, we test the `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` function with the given test cases. The output of each test case is printed to the console. For example, the output for the test case `"apple pie"` is `0` (which represents `false`), because the last character is not alphabetical. The output for the test case `"apple pi e"` is `1` (which represents `true`), because the last character is alphabetical and is not part of a word. 

Note that the `using namespace std;` line is used to avoid having to prefix standard library functions and objects with `std::`. This is generally considered a bad practice in larger programs, but it is acceptable for small programs like this one.
