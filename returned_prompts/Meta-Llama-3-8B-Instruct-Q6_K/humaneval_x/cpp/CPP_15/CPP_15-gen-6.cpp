Here is the corrected code. You were missing a `return` statement in the function `string_sequence`. Also, in the `main` function, you need to include the necessary libraries and headers.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <sstream>

using namespace std;

string string_sequence(int n) {
    if (n < 0) {
        return "Invalid input";
    }
    string result;
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        result += to_string(i) + " ";
    }
    return result.substr(0, result.length() - 1); // remove trailing space
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> n;
    cout << string_sequence(n) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this corrected code:

1. The `return` statement is included in the `string_sequence` function.
2. The necessary libraries and headers are included in the `main` function.
3. The `using namespace std;` directive is included to avoid having to prefix standard library functions and classes with `std::`.
4. The `stringstream` class is not needed, as we are not manipulating strings using streams in this code. Instead, we use the `to_string` function to convert integers to strings and the `substr` function to remove the trailing space from the result string.
