    string s = "";
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        s += to_string(i) + " ";
    }
    return s.substr(0, s.size() - 1);
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> n;
    cout << string_sequence(n) << endl;
    return 0;
}

Output:
Enter a number: 5
0 1 2 3 4 5

Explanation:
The problem is asking for a function that takes an integer `n` and returns a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 up to `n` inclusive. The function `string_sequence` is implemented in the code provided. It uses a for loop to iterate from 0 to `n`, converts each integer to a string using `to_string`, and appends it to the string `s`. After the loop, it returns `s` with the last character (the extra space) removed using `s.substr(0, s.size() - 1)`. The main function prompts the user to enter a number, calls `string_sequence` with that number, and prints the result. The output is as expected, with the space-delimited numbers from 0 to the entered number.
