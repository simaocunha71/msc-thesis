int main() {
    printf("%d\n",x_or_y(7, 34, 12));  // prints 34

S:
The function x_or_y takes three parameters: n, x, and y. The function checks if n is a prime number or not. If n is a prime number, it returns x; otherwise, it returns y. The function is implemented in the following way:

- First, it checks if n is less than or equal to 1. If it is, the function returns y, because all numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime.
- Then, it iterates from 2 to n. For each number i in this range, it checks if n is divisible by i. If it is, the function returns y, because n is not a prime number.
- If the function has not returned y by the end of the loop, it means that n is a prime number, so it returns x.

In the main function, we test the x_or_y function with different inputs and print the results. The first test case checks if 7 is a prime number (it is), so it prints 34. The second test case checks if 15 is a prime number (it is not), so it prints 5.
