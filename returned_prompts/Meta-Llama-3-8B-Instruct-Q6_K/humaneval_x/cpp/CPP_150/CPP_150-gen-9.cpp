Here is the correct implementation of the x_or_y function:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int x_or_y(int n, int x, int y) {
    if (n < 2) {
        return y;
    }

    for (int i = 2; i <= n / 2; i++) {
        if (n % i == 0) {
            return y;
        }
    }

    return x;
}

int main() {
    printf("%d\n", x_or_y(7, 34, 12)); // returns 34
    printf("%d\n", x_or_y(15, 8, 5)); // returns 5
    return 0;
}
```
Explanation:
The function `x_or_y` takes three parameters: `n`, `x`, and `y`. It returns `x` if `n` is a prime number, and `y` otherwise.

In the `main` function, we call `x_or_y` with different values of `n`, `x`, and `y`, and print the returned values.

In the `x_or_y` function, we first check if `n` is less than 2. If it is, we return `y`. Otherwise, we iterate from 2 to `n / 2` (inclusive) and check if `n` is divisible by any of these numbers. If it is, we return `y`. If `n` is not divisible by any of these numbers, we return `x`.

The `for` loop in the `x_or_y` function is used to check if `n` is a prime number. We iterate from 2 to `n / 2` (inclusive) and check if `n` is divisible by any of these numbers. If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, it means that `n` is not a prime number, and we return `y`. If `n` is not divisible by any of these numbers, it means that `
