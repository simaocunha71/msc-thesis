Here is the correct code:

```c
#include<stdio.h>
using namespace std;
int x_or_y(int n,int x,int y){
    if(n<2){
        return y;
    }
    for(int i=2;i<=n/2;i++){
        if(n%i==0){
            return y;
        }
    }
    return x;
}
int main(){
    printf("%d\n",x_or_y(7,34,12));
    printf("%d\n",x_or_y(15,8,5));
    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

The code provided is mostly correct, but there is a small bug in the condition of the if statement in the function x_or_y. The condition should be if (n <= 2) instead of if (n < 2) because 2 is also a prime number.

The function x_or_y takes three parameters: n (the number to be checked for primality), x (the value to be returned if n is a prime number), and y (the value to be returned if n is not a prime number).

The function first checks if n is less than or equal to 2. If it is, the function returns y because 0 and 1 are not considered prime numbers, and 2 is the smallest prime number.

If n is greater than 2, the function checks if n is divisible by any number from 2 to n/2. If it is, the function returns y because n is not a prime number.

If n is not divisible by any number from 2 to n/2, the function returns x because n is a prime number.

The main function calls x_or_y with different values of n, x, and y and prints the returned values.
