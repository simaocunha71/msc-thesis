C:
int main() {
    printf("%d\n", fizz_buzz(50)); //0
    printf("%d\n", fizz_buzz(78)); //2
    printf("%d\n", fizz_buzz(79)); //3
    return 0;
}

B:
Here is a C++ function that counts the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.

This function uses a for loop to iterate over all integers less than n. For each integer, it checks if the integer is divisible by 11 or 13 using the modulus operator. If the integer is divisible by 11 or 13, it counts the number of times the digit 7 appears in the integer. The count is incremented for each occurrence of the digit 7.

Finally, the function returns the total count of the digit 7.

The main function demonstrates the usage of the fizz_buzz function by calling it with different values of n and printing the results.
