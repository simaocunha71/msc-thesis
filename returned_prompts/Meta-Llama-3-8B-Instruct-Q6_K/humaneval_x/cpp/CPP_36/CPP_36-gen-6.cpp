Solution:
The solution is given in the code above. The function `fizz_buzz(int n)` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than `n` which are divisible by 11 or 13. The function works by iterating over all integers less than `n` and checking if they are divisible by 11 or 13. If an integer is divisible by 11 or 13, the function checks if the integer contains the digit 7 by repeatedly dividing the integer by 10 until it becomes 0. If the integer contains the digit 7, the function increments a counter. Finally, the function returns the total count of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than `n` which are divisible by 11 or 13.

In the `main` function, the user is asked to input a number `n`, and the function `fizz_buzz(n)` is called to calculate and print the result. 

For example, if the user inputs 50, the function will return 0, because there are no integers less than 50 that are divisible by 11 or 13 and contain the digit 7. If the user inputs 78, the function will return 2, because the integers 77 and 78 are divisible by 11 or 13 and contain the digit 7. If the user inputs 79, the function will return 3, because the integers 77, 78, and 79 are divisible by 11 or 13 and contain the digit 7. 

The function is named `fizz_buzz` because it is similar to the well-known FizzBuzz problem, where one needs to print the numbers from 1 to n, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz" and multiples of 5 with "Buzz". In this problem, we need to count the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than `n` which are
