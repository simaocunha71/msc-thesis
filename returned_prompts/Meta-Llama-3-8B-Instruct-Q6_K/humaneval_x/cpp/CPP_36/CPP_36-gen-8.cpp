Explanation:
This problem requires counting the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than `n` which are divisible by 11 or 13. 

In the provided code, the function `fizz_buzz` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the count of digit 7's. 

The function iterates over all integers less than `n`, checks if the integer is divisible by 11 or 13, and if it is, it counts the occurrences of the digit 7 in that integer. 

The main function prompts the user to enter a number, calls the `fizz_buzz` function with that number, and prints the result. 

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the input number, because it iterates over all integers less than `n`. The space complexity is O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the count and the current integer. 

Note that the code could be optimized by only checking divisibility by 11 or 13 once for each integer, rather than repeatedly. However, the provided code is simple and easy to understand, and the optimization would not significantly improve performance for most inputs. 

The output of the code will be the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than `n` which are divisible by 11 or 13. For example, `fizz_buzz(50)` will return 0, `fizz_buzz(78)` will return 2, and `fizz_buzz(79)` will return 3. 





C++ code for the problem:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int fizz_buzz(int n) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (i % 11 == 0 || i %
