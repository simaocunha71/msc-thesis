The problem is to get the decimal part of the given float number. 
The decimal part is the difference between the number and the largest integer smaller than the number. 
We can achieve this by subtracting the integer part from the number. 
In the A solution, the integer part is calculated by using the floor() function from the math.h library. 
Then the decimal part is calculated by subtracting the integer part from the number.

The B solution is incorrect because it doesn't handle the case where the number is not an integer. For example, if the number is 3.5, the integer_part will be 3 and the decimal_part will be 0.5. However, if the number is 3.00000001, the integer_part will be 3 and the decimal_part will be 0.00000001, which is incorrect.

The C solution is incorrect because it tries to return the decimal part as a float, but the decimal part is already a float. 

The D solution is incorrect because it calculates the decimal part as the difference between the number and the integer part, which is incorrect. For example, if the number is 3.5, the decimal_part will be 0.5, but the D solution will calculate it as 0.0. 

The A solution is the correct one because it calculates the decimal part correctly by subtracting the integer part from the number.  It also handles the case where the number is not an integer, and it returns the decimal part as a float.  Therefore, the A solution is the best answer.
