    for(int i=2;i*i<=n;i++){
        if(n%i==0){
            n=n/i;
            goto A;
        }
    }

int main(){

    printf("%d\n",largest_prime_factor(n));
    return 0;
}

R:
The provided solution is incorrect. The largest prime factor of a number is not necessarily the last divisor of the number. For example, the largest prime factor of 13195 is 29, not 5. The correct code is:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int largest_prime_factor(int n) {
    int factor = 2;
    while (factor * factor <= n) {
        if (n % factor == 0) {
            n /= factor;
        } else {
            factor++;
        }
    }
    return n;
}

int main() {
    int n = 13195;
    std::cout << largest_prime_factor(n) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This code uses a while loop to find the largest prime factor of a number. It starts with the smallest prime number (2) and checks if the number is divisible by it. If it is, it divides the number by the factor and continues until the number is no longer divisible by the factor. It then increments the factor and continues this process until the number is no longer divisible by any factor. At this point, the remaining number is the largest prime factor. The function returns this value. In the main function, we call this function with the number 13195 and print the result.
