    The function is_nested takes a string of only square brackets as an input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the string has a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket in the subsequence is nested.

    The function iterates over the string and counts the number of open and close brackets. If the count of close brackets ever exceeds the count of open brackets, it returns true, indicating that there is a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket is nested.

    If the function finishes iterating over the string without finding a situation where the count of close brackets exceeds the count of open brackets, it returns false, indicating that there is no valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket is nested.
