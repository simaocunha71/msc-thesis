The correct solution is E.

The reason is that option E correctly implements the requirement of the problem. It iterates over the vector, checks if the index is not divisible by 3, and if it is, it sorts the values at that index. This is the correct implementation of the problem.

The other options do not correctly implement the problem. Option A tries to sort the entire vector, which is not what the problem requires. Option B tries to sort the values at the indices that are divisible
