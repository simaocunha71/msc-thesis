Explanation:

The provided C++ code calculates the Brazilian factorial of a given integer. The Brazilian factorial is defined as the product of factorials of consecutive integers, starting from 1.

The function `special_factorial(int n)` calculates the Brazilian factorial of `n`. It does this by first calculating the factorial of `n` using a loop, and then multiplying this result with the Brazilian factorial of `(n-1)`, `(n-2)`, ..., `1`.

However, this function has a logical error. The recursive call to `special_factorial(i)` is not necessary. The Brazilian factorial can be calculated directly using a single loop.

The corrected code is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

long long special_factorial(int n) {
    long long fact = 1;
    for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++){
        fact *= i;
    }
    long long result = 1;
    for(int i = n; i >= 1; i--){
        result *= fact(i);
    }
    return result;
}

int main(){
    int n;
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    printf("Special factorial of %d is %lld\n", n, special_factorial(n));
    return 0;
}
```

This code calculates the Brazilian factorial of `n` directly using a single loop, without the need for recursion. The outer loop calculates the factorial of `n`, and the inner loop calculates the Brazilian factorial of `n` by multiplying the factorial of `n` with the factorials of `(n-1)`, `(n-2)`, ..., `1`. This results in a more efficient and accurate calculation of the Brazilian factorial.
