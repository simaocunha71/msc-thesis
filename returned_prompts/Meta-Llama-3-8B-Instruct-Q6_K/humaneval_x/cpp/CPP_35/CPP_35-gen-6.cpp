S:
The function `max_element` takes a vector of floats as an argument and returns the maximum element in the vector. The maximum element is determined by iterating through the vector and updating the maximum value if a larger value is found. The function is tested in the `main` function with a sample vector and the result is printed to the console.

Note that the `max_element` function returns a float value, not an integer. This is because the problem statement specifies that the vector contains float values. If the vector were to contain integers, the function would need to be modified to return an integer value instead.

Also, the `max_element` function is not using the `math.h` or `cmath` libraries, which are not necessary for this problem. The `math.h` library is typically used for mathematical functions such as `sin`, `cos`, and `sqrt`, while the `cmath` library is typically used for more advanced mathematical functions such as `pow` and `fmod`. In this case, the `max_element` function is using a simple loop to find the maximum element in the vector, which does not require any mathematical functions.
