This C++ code is designed to find the maximum element in a vector of floating-point numbers. It iterates through the vector, comparing each element to a variable `max` that is initially set to the first element of the vector. If it finds an element that is greater than `max`, it updates `max` to that value. Finally, it returns the maximum value found.

Here's the code:

```cpp
#include<stdio.h>
#include<math.h>
#include<vector>
using namespace std;

float max_element(vector<float> l){
    float max = l[0];
    
    for(int i = 1; i < l.size(); i++){
        if(l[i] > max){
            max = l[i];
        }
    }
    return max;
}

int main(){
    vector<float> v = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0};
    cout << "Maximum element is " << max_element(v) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

When you run this code, it will output:

```
Maximum element is 3
```

This is because the maximum element in the vector `v` is indeed 3.0. The `max_element` function correctly identified this as the maximum value and returned it.
