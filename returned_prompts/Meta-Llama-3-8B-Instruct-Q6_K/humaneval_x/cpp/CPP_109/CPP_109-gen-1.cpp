The provided C++ code checks if a given vector of integers can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing right shift operations. The code iterates through the vector and checks if any element is greater than its previous element. If it finds such an element, it returns `false`, indicating that the vector cannot be sorted in non-decreasing order. If the code completes the iteration without finding any such element, it returns `true`, indicating that the vector can be sorted in non-decreasing order.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. The function `move_one_ball` takes a vector of integers as input.
2. If the vector is empty, the function returns `true`, as an empty vector is considered sorted.
3. The function iterates through the vector using a `for` loop, starting from the second element (index 1).
4. For each element, the function checks if it is greater than its previous element using the condition `arr[i-1] > arr[i]`.
5. If the condition is true, the function returns `false`, indicating that the vector cannot be sorted in non-decreasing order.
6. If the loop completes without finding any such element, the function returns `true`, indicating that the vector can be sorted in non-decreasing order.

In the provided example, the vector `{3, 4, 5, 1, 2}` can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing 2 right shift operations. Therefore, the output of the code is `Yes`.

Here is the corrected code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

bool move_one_ball(vector<int> arr) {
    if (arr.empty()) return true;
    int n = arr.size();
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        int j = i;
        while (j > 0 && arr
