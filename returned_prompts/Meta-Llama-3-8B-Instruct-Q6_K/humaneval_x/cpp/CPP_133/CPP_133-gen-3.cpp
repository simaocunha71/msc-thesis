Explanation:
The program uses a function called sum_squares() to calculate the sum of the squares of the numbers in the given vector lst. The function rounds each number to the upper integer using the ceil() function from the math library, then squares the result using the pow() function and adds it to the sum. The main function creates a vector lst with some numbers, calls the sum_squares() function with this vector, and prints the result. In this case, the sum of squares is 29.0. The program uses the printf() function to print the result with a decimal point. If you want to print the result as an integer, you can use the %d format specifier instead of %f.
