int main(){

Answer:
The code will compile and run without errors. It will calculate the sum of squared numbers in the given vector after rounding each element to the upper int(Ceiling) first. The output for the given example will be 14.

The code includes the necessary libraries (math.h and iostream), declares a function sum_squares that calculates the sum of squared numbers, and includes the main function where the code is executed. The vector lst is initialized with the given numbers, and the function sum_squares is called with this vector as an argument. The result is printed to the console.

The function sum_squares iterates over each element in the vector, rounds the element to the upper int(Ceiling) using the ceil function, squares the rounded element, and adds the result to the sum. The sum is then returned.

The main function initializes the vector lst with the given numbers, calls the function sum_squares with this vector as an argument, and prints the result to the console.

The code can be used to calculate the sum of squared numbers in any given vector after rounding each element to the upper int(Ceiling) first. The output will be the sum of squared numbers in the given vector.
