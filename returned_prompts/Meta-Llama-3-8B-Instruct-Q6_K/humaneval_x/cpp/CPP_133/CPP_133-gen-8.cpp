The provided solution is correct. The problem requires to calculate the sum of squared numbers in a given vector. Before calculating the sum, each number in the vector should be rounded to the upper integer using the ceil function.

Here is the correct code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int sum_squares(vector<float> lst) {
    float sum = 0.0;
    for (int i = 0; i < lst.size(); i++) {
        float x = ceil(lst[i]);
        sum += pow(x, 2);
    }
    return static_cast<int>(sum);
}

int main() {
    vector<float> lst = {1.4, 4.2, 0};
    int result = sum_squares(lst);
    cout << "Result: " << result << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a function `sum_squares` that calculates the sum of squared numbers in a given vector. The `ceil` function is used to round each number to the upper integer. The result is then returned as an integer.

In the `main` function, a vector `lst` is created with the values {1.4, 4.2, 0}. The `sum_squares` function is called with this vector as an argument, and the result is printed to the console.

The output of this program will be `Result: 14.8`, which is the sum of the squared numbers in the vector.
