    int sum=0;
    for(int i = 0; i < lst.size(); i++){
        float num = ceil(lst[i]);
        sum += (num * num);
    }
    return sum;
}

int main()
{
    vector<float> lst = {1.4,4.2,0};
    printf("%d\n",sum_squares(lst));
    return 0;
}

C:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int sum_squares(vector<float> lst){
    int sum = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < lst.size(); i++){
        float num = ceil(lst[i]);
        sum += (int)sqrt(num); // convert to int and square
    }
    return sum;
}

int main(){
    vector<float> lst = {1.4,4.2,0};
    printf("%d\n",sum_squares(lst));
    return 0;
}
```
```
Output: 
29

Explanation:
The program takes a vector of floating point numbers as an input, and returns the sum of the squares of the ceiling of each number in the vector. 

In the main function, a vector of floating point numbers is created and passed to the function sum_squares. The output of the program is the sum of the squares of the ceiling of each number in the vector. 

The sum_squares function iterates over each number in the vector, calculates the ceiling of the number using the ceil function, squares the ceiling, and adds it to the sum. The sum is then returned.

Note that the program uses the ceil function to round up to the nearest integer, and the sqrt function to calculate the square root. The result is then converted to an integer using the int cast. This is because the problem statement asks for the sum of the squares of the ceiling of each number, which implies that the result should be an integer. 

The program also uses the printf function to print the output to the console. The %d format specifier is used to print an integer, which is the return value of the sum_squares function. 

The output of the program is the sum of the squares of the ceiling of each number in the vector, which is 29 in this case.
