This program takes a string representing musical notes in a special ASCII format and returns a vector of integers corresponding to how many beats does each note last. It iterates through the string, updating the beats count based on the current note, and when a note is finished, it adds the beats count to the result vector. 

For example, for the input string "o o| .| o| o| .| .| .| .| o o", the output will be "4 2 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 4 4". 

The program correctly handles the different types of notes, including whole notes, half notes, and quarter notes. It also correctly handles the case where multiple notes are played consecutively. 

The time complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because it iterates through the string once. The space complexity is also O(n), because in the worst case, all notes in the input string could be whole notes, resulting in a vector of size n.
