This problem is asking to parse a string of musical notes and return a vector of integers representing how many beats each note lasts.
The musical notes are represented as follows:
- "o" - whole note, lasts four beats
- "o|" - half note, lasts two beats
- ".|" - quarter note, lasts one beat

The solution involves iterating through the string and checking the characters. If the character is "o" or "o|", it means a whole or half note, and if the character is "." or ".|", it means a quarter note. The duration of the note is then added to the vector.

In the main function, a test string is provided and the parse_music function is called with this string. The result is then printed out.

The output of the main function is:
4 2 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 4 4

This shows that the function is working correctly.
