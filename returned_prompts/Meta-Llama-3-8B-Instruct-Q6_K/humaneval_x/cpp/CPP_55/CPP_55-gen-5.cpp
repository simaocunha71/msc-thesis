    if(n <=1) return n;
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
}
int main() {
    int n;
    printf("Enter the number of Fibonacci sequence you want: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    printf("The %d-th Fibonacci number is: %d\n", n, fib(n));
    return 0;
}

S:
The recursive function `fib(n)` is called with `n` as the argument. If `n` is 0 or 1, the function returns `n` directly. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `n-1` and `n-2` as arguments, and returns the sum of these two calls. This is the definition of the Fibonacci sequence.

The `main` function prompts the user to input the number of the Fibonacci sequence they want, and then calls `fib(n)` with this number. The result is then printed to the console.

However, this recursive function has a major problem: it is very inefficient. The function calls itself many times, which can cause a stack overflow for large values of `n`. For example, `fib(10)` calls `fib(9)` and `fib(8)`, which in turn call `fib(8)` and `fib(7)`, and so on. This leads to a lot of repeated calculations, which is unnecessary and wasteful.

To fix this, we can use a technique called memoization. Memoization is a way to store the results of expensive function calls and return the cached result when the same inputs occur again. This can be done by adding a cache to the `fib` function, which stores the results of previous calls.

Here is the modified code:
```c
int fib(int n, int* cache) {
    if (n <= 1) return n;
    if (cache[n] != 0) return cache[n];
    int result = fib(n-1, cache) + fib(n-2, cache);
    cache[n] = result;
    return result;
}
```
In this code, we added a `cache` array to store the results of previous calls. Before calculating the result, we check if the result is already in the cache. If it is, we return the cached result. Otherwise, we calculate the result and store it in the cache.

We also need to initialize the cache array before calling the `fib` function. We can do this in the `main` function:
```c
