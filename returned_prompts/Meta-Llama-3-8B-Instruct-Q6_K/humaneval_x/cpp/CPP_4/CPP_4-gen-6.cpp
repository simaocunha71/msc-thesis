    // calculate mean of input numbers
    float sum = 0.0;
    for (float num : numbers) {
        sum += num;
    }
    float mean = sum / numbers.size();

    // calculate mean absolute deviation
    float mad = 0.0;
    for (float num : numbers) {
        mad += abs(num - mean);
    }
    mad /= numbers.size();

    return mad;
}

int main() {
    vector<float> numbers = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0};
    printf("Mean Absolute Deviation: %f\n", mean_absolute_deviation(numbers));

}

Output:
Mean Absolute Deviation: 1.000000

Explanation:
The code calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of a given vector of input numbers. It first calculates the mean of the numbers and then calculates the absolute difference between each number and the mean. The average of these absolute differences is the Mean Absolute Deviation.

The code uses the following steps to calculate the MAD:

1. Calculate the mean of the input numbers by summing all the numbers and dividing by the number of elements.
2. Initialize a variable `mad` to zero, which will store the Mean Absolute Deviation.
3. Iterate over the input numbers, calculate the absolute difference between each number and the mean, and add it to `mad`.
4. Divide `mad` by the number of elements to get the average absolute difference, which is the Mean Absolute Deviation.

In the `main` function, a vector of numbers is created and the `mean_absolute_deviation` function is called with this vector as an argument. The result is printed to the console.

The output of the program is the Mean Absolute Deviation of the input numbers, which is 1.0 in this case.
