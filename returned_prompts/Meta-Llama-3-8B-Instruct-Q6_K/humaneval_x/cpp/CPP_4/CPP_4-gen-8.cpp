        sum += numbers[i];

int main(){
    vector<float> numbers = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0};

}
B:
The code in the above example calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) by subtracting the mean from each element in the vector, taking the absolute value, and then summing up all these absolute values. Finally, the sum is divided by the size of the vector to get the MAD.

The output of this code will be:
Mean Absolute Deviation is: 1.00

This is because the mean of the given numbers is (1+2+3+4)/4 = 2.5 and the absolute deviations from the mean are |1-2.5| = 1.5, |2-2.5| = 0.5, |3-2.5| = 0.5, |4-2.5| = 1.5. The average of these absolute deviations is (1.5+0.5+0.5+1.5)/4 = 1.0.
