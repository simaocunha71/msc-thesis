    int max_strength = -1000;
    string strongest_extension = "";
    for(string extension: extensions){
        int cap = 0, sm = 0;
        for(char c: extension){
            if(c >= 'A' && c <= 'Z') cap++;
            else sm++;
        }
        int strength = cap - sm;
        if(strength > max_strength){
            max_strength = strength;
            strongest_extension = extension;
        }
    }
    return class_name + "." + strongest_extension;
} // This is the solution of the problem.

B:
    int main() {
        string class_name = "Slices";
        vector<string> extensions = {"SErviNGSliCes", "Cheese", "StuFfed"};
        cout << Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions) << endl;
        return 0;
    } // This is the main function.

C:
    // You can test the function with different inputs.
    int main() {
        string class_name = "my_class";
        vector<string> extensions = {"AA", "Be", "CC"};
        cout << Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions) << endl;
        return 0;
    } // This is the main function.

The output of the program will be:
Slices.SErviNGSliCes
my_class.AA
The time complexity of this solution is O(n*m) where n is the number of extensions and m is the length of each extension. The space complexity is O(1) as we are not using any additional space that scales with the input size. The function Strongest_Extension takes a string class_name and a vector of strings extensions as input and returns a string. It iterates over each extension, calculates its strength, and keeps track of the strongest extension. Finally, it returns the class name followed by the strongest extension name. The function is tested with two different inputs in the main function. The output of the program is the strongest extension name for each input.
