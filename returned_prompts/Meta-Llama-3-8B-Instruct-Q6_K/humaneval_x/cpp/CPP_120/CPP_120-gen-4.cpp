Explanation:
The problem is asking to return a sorted vector of length k with the maximum k numbers in arr. 
The given code does exactly that. It first sorts the input array in ascending order using the sort function from the STL. 
Then it creates a result vector of length k and fills it with the k largest numbers from the sorted array. 
The k largest numbers are obtained by starting from the end of the sorted array and moving backwards. 
This approach ensures that the k largest numbers are selected, as the array is sorted in ascending order. 
The time complexity of this approach is O(nlogn) due to the sorting operation, and the space complexity is O(1) as we are not using any extra space. 
The main function demonstrates the usage of the maximum function with an example input. 
The output of the program is the sorted vector of length k with the maximum k numbers in the input array. 

Note: The problem description does not specify whether the result vector should be in ascending or descending order. 
However, based on the example inputs provided, it seems that the result vector should be in descending order. 
If the result vector should be in ascending order, the code can be modified to start from the beginning of the sorted array instead of the end. 
For example, the line `res[i]=arr[arr.size()-1-i];` can be replaced with `res[i]=arr[i];`. 
This modification would result in a time complexity of O(nlogn) due to the sorting operation, and a space complexity of O(1) as we are not
