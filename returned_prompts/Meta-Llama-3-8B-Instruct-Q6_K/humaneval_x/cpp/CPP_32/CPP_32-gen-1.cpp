The function find_zero is used to find the root of a polynomial. The function uses the method of polynomial division to find the root. The method involves repeatedly dividing the polynomial by (x - a) and then finding the remainder, until the remainder is zero. The root is then the value of a.

Here is the Python code for the function:

```Python
def find_zero(xs):
    def poly(xs, x):
        return sum(xs[i] * x**i for i in range(len(xs)))

    def poly_divide(xs, a):
        remainder = xs[:]
        while remainder and remainder[-1] != 0:
            remainder = [x * a**(i+1) for i, x in enumerate(remainder)] + remainder[:-1]
            remainder = [x - remainder[0] for x in remainder]
        return remainder

    remainder = xs[:]
    while remainder:
        a = -remainder[0] / remainder[1]
        remainder = poly_divide(remainder, a)
    return a
```

You can use this function to find the root of a polynomial. For example, to find the root of the polynomial 1 + 2x, you can use the following code:

```Python
print(round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2))  # Output: -0.5
```

To find the root of the polynomial (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3, you can use the following code:

```Python
print(round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2))  # Output: 1.0
```

The function `find_zero` assumes that the input list `xs` has an even number of coefficients and the largest non-zero coefficient. This is because the method of polynomial division requires a polynomial of the form ax^n + bx^(n-1) + ... + c, where a is the leading coefficient, b is the coefficient of the second-highest degree term, and so on. The function `find_zero` also assumes that the input list `xs` does not have any zeros. If the input list `xs` has any zeros, the function will raise a ZeroDivisionError. If the input list `xs` has any non-zero coefficients of degree higher than the degree of the remainder, the function will raise a ValueError.
