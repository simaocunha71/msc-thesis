Here is a simple implementation of the function to find the zero of a polynomial. This function uses the Newton-Raphson method to find the root of the polynomial. The Newton-Raphson method is a popular method for finding the root of a function, and it is particularly well-suited for finding the root of a polynomial.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

double poly(vector<double> xs, double x){
    /* 
    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x. return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x^2 + .... xs[n] * x^n 
    */
    double sum=0;
    int i;
    for (i=0;i<xs.size();i++)
    {
        sum+=xs[i]*pow(x,i);
    }
    return sum;
}

double find_zero(vector<double> xs){
    /* 
    xs are coefficients of a polynomial. find_zero find x such that poly(x) = 0. find_zero returns only only zero point, even if there are many. 
    Moreover, find_zero only takes list xs having even number of coefficients and largest non zero coefficient as it guarantees a solution.
    >>> round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2) #f(x) = 1 + 2x 
    -0.5 
    >>> round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2) # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3 
    1.0
    */
    // Check if the number of coefficients is even
    if (xs.size() % 2 != 0) {
        cout << "Error: The number of coefficients must be even." << endl;
        return -1;
    }
    // Start with an initial guess for the root
    double x = 1.0; // You can adjust this value based on your needs
    // Iterate until the root is found
    while (true) {
        double f = poly(xs, x);
        double f_prime = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < xs.size(); i++) {
            f_prime += i * xs[i] * pow(x, i - 1);
        }
        x = x - f / f_prime
