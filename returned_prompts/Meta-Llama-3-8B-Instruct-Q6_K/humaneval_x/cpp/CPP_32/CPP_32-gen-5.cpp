Here is a simple solution for the problem. It uses the Newton-Raphson method for finding the root of a polynomial.

```python
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

double poly(vector<double> xs, double x) {
    double sum = 0;
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < xs.size(); i++) {
        sum += xs[i] * pow(x, i);
    }
    return sum;
}

double find_zero(vector<double> xs) {
    if (xs.size() % 2 == 1) {
        throw runtime_error("The polynomial should have an even number of coefficients");
    }

    double x = 1.0;  // initial guess
    double eps = 1e-6;  // precision

    while (true) {
        double dx = -poly(xs, x) / poly(xs, x);  // derivative
        x -= dx;  // update x
        if (abs(dx) < eps) {
            break;
        }
    }
    return x;
}

int main() {
    vector<double> xs = {1, 2};
    double x = find_zero(xs);
    cout << "The root is " << x << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In the above code, the `poly` function evaluates the polynomial at a given point `x`. The `find_zero` function uses the Newton-Raphson method to find the root of the polynomial. It starts with an initial guess `x` and updates it until the derivative of the polynomial is smaller than a given precision `eps`.

In the `main` function, we test the `find_zero` function with a simple polynomial `f(x) = 1 + 2x`. The root of this polynomial is `-0.5`. The output of the program will be:

```
The root is -0.5
```


This code assumes that the input polynomial has an even number of coefficients. If the polynomial has an odd number of coefficients, the code will throw a `runtime_error`. If you want to handle the case where the polynomial has an odd number of coefficients, you can modify the code to add an extra coefficient to the polynomial. For example, you can add a coefficient of `0` to the polynomial. This will not affect the root of the polynomial, but it will make the polynomial have an even number of coefficients.
