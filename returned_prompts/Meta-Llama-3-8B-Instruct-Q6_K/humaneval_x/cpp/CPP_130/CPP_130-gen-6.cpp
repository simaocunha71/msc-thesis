Solution:
The problem is asking to find the first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence. The Tribonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence: 
tri(1) = 3
tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even.
tri(n) =  tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd.

The given code is correct and it uses recursion to generate the Tribonacci sequence. It first initializes an empty vector and then fills it with the first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.

Here is the breakdown of the code:

1. The function `tri(int n)` is defined to generate the first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.
2. The base cases are handled: if n is 0, an empty vector is returned; if n is 1 or 2, the vector [3] or [1, 3] is returned, respectively.
3. For n greater than 2, the function uses a loop to generate the first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.
4. If n is even, the next number in the sequence is calculated as 1 + n / 2.
5. If n is odd, the next number in the sequence is calculated using the recurrence relation: tri(n) =
