Explanation:
This is a simple implementation of the Tribonacci sequence in C++.
The function tri() takes an integer n as input and returns a vector of the first n+1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.
The function first checks if n is less than 0, in which case it returns an empty vector.
It then initializes the vector with the first three numbers of the sequence: 1, 3, and 2.
For each number i from 3 to n, it checks if i is even. If it is, the next number in the sequence is calculated as 1 + i/2. If i is odd, the next number is calculated as the sum of the previous three numbers in the sequence.
Finally, the function returns the vector of the first n+1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence. In the main function, we call the tri() function with n = 3 and print the result. The output is 1 3 2 8, which is the Tribonacci sequence up to the 4th number.
