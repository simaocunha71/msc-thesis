    int open = 0, close = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < lst.size(); i++) {
        for (char c : lst[i]) {
            if (c == '(') {
                open++;
            } else {
                close++;
            }
        }
    }
    if (open == close) {
        return "Yes";
    }
    return "No";
}

B:
    int open = 0, close = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < lst.size(); i++) {
        for (char c : lst[i]) {
            if (c == '(') {
                open++;
            } else {
                if (open == 0) {
                    return "No";
                }
                open--;
            }
        }
    }
    return "Yes";

}
int main() {
    vector<string> lst = { "()(", ")" };
    printf("%s\n", match_parens(lst).c_str());
    return 0;
}  



```
Output:
Yes
```

Explanation:
The function `match_parens` takes a vector of strings as input. It counts the number of open and close parentheses in the strings. If the number of open and close parentheses is the same, it returns "Yes", meaning it is possible to make a good string by concatenating the strings in some order. If the number of open and close parentheses is not the same, it returns "No", meaning it is not possible to make a good string.

In the main function, we create a vector of strings `lst` and pass it to the `match_parens` function. The output is "Yes", indicating that it is possible to make a good string by concatenating the strings in some order.

In the second version of the function `match_parens`, we also count the number of open and close parentheses, but we also check if we have more close parentheses than open parentheses. If we do, it means that we cannot make a good string by concatenating the strings in some order, so we return "No". If we do not have more close parentheses than open parentheses, it means that we can make a good string by concatenating the strings in some order, so we return "Yes". This version of the function is more accurate because it checks for the possibility of making a good string by concatenating the strings in some order.
