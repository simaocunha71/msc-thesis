Answer: B
Explanation: The idea behind this problem is that each car is a unique combination of left and right moving cars. The number of combinations of n items taken 2 at a time is given by the formula n*(n-1)/2. This is because the first car can be paired with n-1 other cars, the second car can be paired with n-2 other cars, and so on until the nth car, which can be paired with 1 other car. Since each car is a unique combination, the total number of collisions is given by n*(n-1)/2. This is the correct answer. The other options do not correctly calculate the number of collisions. Option A is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that each car is a unique combination of left and right moving cars. Option C is incorrect because it does not divide the result by 2. Option D is incorrect because it squares the number of cars instead of taking the
