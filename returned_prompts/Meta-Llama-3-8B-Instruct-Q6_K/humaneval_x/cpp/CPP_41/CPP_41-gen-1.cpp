Answer: A) C

Explanation: The problem states that the two sets of cars start out being very far from each other. This means that we only need to consider cars that are moving in the same direction. For each car moving left to right, we need to consider all cars moving right to left that are to its left. Therefore, the number of collisions is the sum of the number of cars moving left to right and the number of cars moving right to left. This is equivalent to the sum of the number of pairs of cars moving in the same direction. This is the formula given in option C. For example, for 3 cars, there are 3 pairs of cars moving left to right and 3 pairs of cars moving right to left, for a total of 6 collisions. For n cars, the number of collisions is given by the formula n*(n-1)/2, which is equivalent to the formula given in option C. This is the correct answer.
