S:
The problem requires to find the biggest even number within the range [x, y]. If no such number exists, the function should return -1. 

The given code does not meet the requirements of the problem. It is not checking if the numbers are even or not. It is simply comparing the numbers and returning the bigger one. 

Here is the correct code:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>

int choose_num(int x, int y) {
    if (x > y) {
        return -1;
    } else if (x % 2 == 0) {
        while (x > y) {
            x -= 2;
            if (x <= y) {
                return x;
            }
        }
        return x;
    } else {
        while (x < y) {
            x += 2;
            if (x >= y) {
                return x;
            }
        }
        return x;
    }
}

int main() {
    printf("%d\n", choose_num(12, 15));
    return 0;
}
```

In this code, we first check if x is greater than y. If it is, we return -1 because there is no even number in the range. 

If x is not greater than y, we check if x is even. If it is, we decrement x by 2 until it is less than or equal to y. We return the last even number we found. 

If x is not even, we increment x by 2 until it is greater than or equal to y. We return the last even number we found. 

This way, we ensure that we are always returning the biggest even number in the range [x, y]. If no such number exists, we return -1. 

The main function simply calls the choose_num function with the arguments 12 and 15, and prints the result. 

This code will correctly solve the problem and return the biggest even number in the range [x, y]. If no such number exists, it will return -1.
