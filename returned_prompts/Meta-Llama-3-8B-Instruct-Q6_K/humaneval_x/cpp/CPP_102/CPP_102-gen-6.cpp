Output:
14
-1

Explanation:
The function `choose_num` takes two positive numbers `x` and `y` as input. It checks if `x` is greater than `y` and swaps them if needed. Then it checks if `x` is odd and increments `x` until it becomes even. Finally, it checks if the even `x` is within the range `[x, y]`. If it is, the function returns `x`. If not, it returns -1.

In the example, for `choose_num(12, 15)`, `x` is even and within the range, so the function returns `14`. For `choose_num(13, 12)`, `x` is odd and there is no even number in the range, so the function returns -1.
