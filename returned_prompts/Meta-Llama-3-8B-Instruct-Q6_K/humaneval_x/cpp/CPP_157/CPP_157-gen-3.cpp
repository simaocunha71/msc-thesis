The problem is asking you to write a function that checks if three given sides form a right-angled triangle. A right-angled triangle is a triangle where one angle is 90 degrees.

The problem description does not specify the type of the function but it seems like it should be a boolean function that returns true if the three sides form a right-angled triangle and false otherwise.

Here is a simple C++ function that solves this problem:

```cpp
#include <cmath>

bool right_angle_triangle(float a, float b, float c) {
    if (a*a + b*b == c*c || a*a + c*c == b*b || b*b + c*c == a*a) {
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}
```

This function uses the Pythagorean theorem to check if the three sides can form a right-angled triangle. The theorem states that for a right-angled triangle with legs of length a and b, and a hypotenuse of length c, the following equation is true: a^2 + b^2 = c^2.

The function takes three float parameters a, b, and c, and returns true if the three sides form a right-angled triangle, and false otherwise.

Here is an example of how you can use this function:

```cpp
int main() {
    printf("%d", right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5));
    return 0;
}
```

This will print 1, because the sides 3, 4, and 5 form a right-angled triangle. If you change the sides to 1, 2, and 3, the function will return 0, because these sides do not form a right-angled triangle.
