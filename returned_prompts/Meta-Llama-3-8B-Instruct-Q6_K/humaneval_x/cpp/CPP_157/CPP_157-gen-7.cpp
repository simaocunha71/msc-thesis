The given C++ code checks whether the given three sides of a triangle can form a right-angled triangle or not. The condition for a right-angled triangle is that the square of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides (a and b). This is known as the Pythagorean theorem.

The function `right_angle_triangle(float a, float b, float c)` checks this condition and returns `true` if the triangle is right-angled and `false` otherwise.

In the `main()` function, we test this function with two examples: (3, 4, 5) and (1, 2, 3). The output will be:
```
1
0
```
This means that the first example forms a right-angled triangle and the second does not.
