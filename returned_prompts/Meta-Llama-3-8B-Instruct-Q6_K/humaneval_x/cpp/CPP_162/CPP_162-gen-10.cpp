Explanation:
This C++ program takes a string as input and returns its MD5 hash equivalent string. The MD5 hash is a cryptographic hash function that produces a 128-bit (16-byte) hash value.

Here's how the program works:

1.  It first checks if the input string is empty. If it is, the program returns an empty string.
2.  It then uses the OpenSSL library to compute the MD5 hash of the input string. The `MD5` function takes three arguments: a pointer to the input string, the length of the input string, and a buffer to store the hash value.
3.  The program then converts the hash value to a string by formatting each byte of the hash value as a two-digit hexadecimal number.
4.  Finally, the program returns the resulting string.

In the `main` function, we test the `string_to_md5` function with the string "Hello world" and print the result. The output should be the MD5 hash of the input string.

Note that the `MD5` function is part of the OpenSSL library, which is a widely used cryptographic library. The `string_to_md5` function uses the `MD5` function to compute the MD5 hash of the input string.

The `#include` directives at the top of the program include the necessary headers for the OpenSSL library and the C++ standard library.

The `using namespace std;` directive allows us to use the `string` class and other standard library classes without qualifying them with the `std::` prefix.

The `string_to_md5` function returns a `string` object, which is a sequence of characters. The `MD5_DIGEST_LENGTH` constant is defined in the OpenSSL library and represents the length of the MD5 hash value in bytes. The `MD5` function returns a pointer to the MD5 hash value, which is stored in the `md5` array. The `sprintf` function is used to format each byte of the hash value as a two-digit hexadecimal number
