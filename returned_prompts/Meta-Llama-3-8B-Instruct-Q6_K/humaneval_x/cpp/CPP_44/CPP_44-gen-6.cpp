string str = "";
if (x == 0) return "0";
while (x > 0) {
    str = (char)(x % base + '0') + str;
    x /= base;
}
return str;
}
int main() {
    printf("%s\n",change_base(8, 3).c_str());
    printf("%s\n",change_base(8, 2).c_str());
    printf("%s\n",change_base(7, 2).c_str());
    return 0;
}

Solution:
The provided code is almost correct, but it doesn't handle the case when the base is greater than 9 correctly. We need to modify the code to handle this case.

Here's the modified code:

```cpp
#include<stdio.h>
#include<string>
using namespace std;

string change_base(int x, int base) {
    string str = "";
    if (x == 0) return "0";
    while (x > 0) {
        char c = (char)(x % base + '0');
        if (c > '9') {
            c += 'a' - '9' - 1; // Convert to lowercase letter
        }
        str = c + str;
        x /= base;
    }
    return str;
}

int main() {
    printf("%s\n",change_base(8, 3).c_str());
    printf("%s\n",change_base(8, 2).c_str());
    printf("%s\n",change_base(7, 2).c_str());
    return 0;
}
```

In this modified code, when the remainder of `x % base` is greater than '9', we add the difference of the ASCII values of 'a' and '9' to convert it to a lowercase letter. This way, we can handle bases greater than 9 correctly. For example, when the base is 16, the numbers 10 to 15 are represented as 'a' to 'f' respectively. Similarly, when the base is 17, the numbers 10 to 17 are represented as 'a' to 'q' respectively, and so on. This code can handle any base less than 36, as 'a' to 'z' are used to represent numbers greater than 9. If you want to handle bases greater than 36, you will need to use uppercase letters and/or non-ASCII characters.
