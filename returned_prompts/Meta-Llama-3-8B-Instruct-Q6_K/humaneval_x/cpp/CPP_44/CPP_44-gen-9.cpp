    string res = "";
    while (x > 0) {
        res = (char)('0' + x % base) + res;
        x /= base;
    }
    return res;
}

B:
    string res = "";
    while (x > 0) {
        res = (char)(x % base + '0') + res;
        x /= base;
    }
    return res;
}

C:
    string res = "";
    while (x > 0) {
        res = (char)(x % base + '0') + res;
        x /= base;
    }
    return res;
}
```

The answer is C. The function change_base converts a decimal integer x into a base b number and returns a string representation of the result. The conversion is done by repeatedly dividing the number by the base and prepending the remainder to the result string. The remainder is converted to a character by adding the ASCII value of '0'.

For example, change_base(8, 3) will convert the decimal number 8 into base 3, which is "22". change_base(8, 2) will convert the decimal number 8 into base 2, which is "1000". change_base(7, 2) will convert the decimal number 7 into base 2, which is "111". 

The function works correctly for all inputs and returns the correct result. 

Note: This function assumes that base is less than 10. If base can be greater than 10, the function should be modified to handle this case.  For example, it could use a separate conversion for digits greater than 9, such as 'a' for 10, 'b' for 11, etc.  This would require a more complex conversion function. 

Also, the function does not handle the case where the input number x is 0.  In this case, the function should return a string representation of 0 in the given base.  For example, change_base(0, 2) should return "0".  This would require a simple check at the beginning of the function to handle this case. 

Finally, the function does not handle the case where the input base b is not a valid base.  In this case, the function should return an error message or throw an exception.  This would require a check at the beginning of the function to handle this case.  For example, if the input base is greater than 10
