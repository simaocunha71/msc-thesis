The code is correct. It converts a decimal number to another base. The given code is doing this by repeatedly dividing the number by the new base and appending the remainder to the result string.

The code starts by initializing an empty string `s` and an integer `temp` to the input number `x`. It then enters a while loop that continues as long as `temp` is greater than 0. In each iteration, the remainder of `temp` divided by `base` is appended to the string `s` as a character (by adding '0' to the remainder), and `temp` is updated to the integer division of `temp` by `base`.

After the loop, the string `s` is reversed using the `reverse` function from the `<algorithm>` library, and the result is returned as a string.

The main function calls the `change_base` function with different inputs and prints the results to the console. The output matches the
