R:
The function `can_arrange` is implemented to return the largest index of an element which is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. If no such element exists, it returns -1. The given vector will not contain duplicate values.

The function iterates through the vector from the second element to the last element. For each element, it checks if the element is less than or equal to the previous element. If it finds such an element, it returns the index of the previous element (i.e., i-1). If it does not find any such element, it returns -1 at the end of the function.

In the main function, a sample vector is created and the `can_arrange` function is called with this vector as the argument. The result is then printed to the console.

The output of the program will be:
```
The largest index of an element which is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it is 3
```
This is because the element at index 3 (i.e., 3) is not greater than or equal to the element at index 2 (i.e., 2). If we continue the iteration, we will not find any element that is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it, so the function returns -1.

This code demonstrates a simple and efficient solution to the problem. It has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the input vector, because it iterates through the vector once. The space complexity is O(1), because it does not use any extra space that scales with the input size.
