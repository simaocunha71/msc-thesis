    int n = arr.size();
    int res = -1;
    for(int i = 1; i < n; i++){
        if(arr[i] <= arr[i-1]){
            res = i;
        }
    }
    return res;
}

B:
    int n = arr.size();
    for(int i = 1; i < n; i++){
        if(arr[i] <= arr[i-1]){
            return i;
        }
    }
    return -1;

C:
    for(int i = 1; i < arr.size(); i++){
        if(arr[i] <= arr[i-1]){
            return i;
        }
    }
    return -1;

D:
    int res = -1;
    for(int i = 1; i < arr.size(); i++){
        if(arr[i] <= arr[i-1]){
            res = i;
        }
    }
    return res;

All of the above functions will produce the correct output. They all loop through the vector, checking if the current element is less than or equal to the previous element. If it finds such an element, it returns its index. If it doesn't find any, it returns -1. The time complexity of these functions is O(n), where n is the size of the input vector. The space complexity is O(1), as they only use a constant amount of space to store the result and loop variables. 

However, the most efficient way to write this function is option B. It is more concise and doesn't use an extra variable to store the result. It returns as soon as it finds an element that meets the condition, which can be more efficient than continuing to loop through the rest of the vector. 

It's worth noting that the problem statement doesn't specify whether the input vector is sorted or not. In this case, the function will work correctly regardless of the order of the elements. If the input vector is guaranteed to be sorted, then the function can be simplified to return -1 immediately, since there can't be any elements that are not greater than or equal to the previous element.
