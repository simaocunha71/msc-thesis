    int i;
    int index = -1;
    for(i = 1; i < arr.size(); i++){
        if(arr[i-1] <= arr[i]){
            index = i-1;
            break;
        }
    }
    return index;

B:
The function can_arrange() takes a vector of integers as input and returns the largest index of an element which is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. It starts by initializing index to -1, then iterates through the array. If it finds an element that is not greater than or equal to the previous element, it updates index with the current index and breaks out of the loop. Finally, it returns the index.

The main function creates a vector of integers and calls the can_arrange() function with this vector as an argument. It then prints the returned index. In this case, the output will be the largest index of an element which is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it, which is 3 in this case. If no such element exists, it returns -1. In this case, the output will be -1 if the vector does not contain any such element.

This function does not check if the array is sorted or not, it just checks if the current element is less than the previous one. So, if the array is already sorted, it will return -1. If you want to check if the array is sorted, you can add a condition to check if the array is already sorted before checking for the largest index. C++ Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int can_arrange(vector<int> arr) {
    int index = -1;
    for (int i = 1; i < arr.size(); i++) {
        if (arr[i - 1] <= arr[i]) {
            index = i - 1;
            break;
        }
    }
    return index;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> arr = {1, 2, 4, 3, 5};
    cout << "The largest index is " << can_arrange(arr) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
Output:
```
The largest index is 3
