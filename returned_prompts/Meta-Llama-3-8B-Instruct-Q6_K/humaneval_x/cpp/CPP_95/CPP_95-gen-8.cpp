S:
The function check_dict_case checks if all keys in a map are strings in lower case or all keys are strings in upper case. It returns true if all keys are in lower case or upper case, else it returns false. If the given map is empty, it returns false.

Here is the explanation of the code:
1. The function check_dict_case takes a map as an argument.
2. It first checks if the map is empty. If it is empty, it returns false.
3. It then iterates over the map using an iterator.
4. For each key-value pair, it checks if the first character of the key is neither in lower case nor in upper case. If it finds such a key, it immediately returns false.
5. If it finishes iterating over the map without finding any key that is neither in lower case nor in upper case, it returns true.

In the main function, a map named dict is created with two key-value pairs. The function check_dict_case is called with dict as an argument, and the result is printed to the console. Since all keys in the map are in upper case, the function returns true, and the output is 1. If the map had a key that was neither in lower case nor in upper case, the function would return false, and the output would be 0. If the map were empty, the function would return false, and the output would be 0.
