    The function check_dict_case checks if all keys in a map are either 
    in lower case or in upper case. It iterates over the map, and 
    checks if each key starts with a lowercase or uppercase letter. 
    If it finds a key that starts with neither, it immediately returns 
    false. If it checks all keys without finding any that start with 
    neither, it returns true if all keys are in lower case, or false 
    if all keys are in upper case.
