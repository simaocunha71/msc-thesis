S:
    The function sum_squares calculates the sum of squares and cubes of the elements in the given list according to certain conditions.

    The function iterates over each element in the list. If the index of the element is a multiple of both 3 and 4, it cubes the element. If the index is a multiple of 3 but not 4, it squares the element. If the index is a multiple of 4 but not 3, it also cubes the element. For all other cases, it leaves the element unchanged.

    The sum of the modified elements is then calculated and returned.

    In the main function, we create a list {1,2,3} and call the sum_squares function with this list as an argument. The result is then printed to the console.

    The output of this program will be 6, which is the sum of the squares and cubes of the elements in the list according to the given conditions.
