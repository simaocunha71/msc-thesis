B:
The function sum_squares() is defined to take a vector of integers as the input. It initializes a variable sum to zero. Then it iterates over the elements of the vector using a for loop. For each element, it checks the conditions specified in the problem statement. If the index is a multiple of 3 and not a multiple of 4, it squares the element. If the index is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3, it cubes the element. For all other cases, it simply adds the element to the sum. Finally, it returns the sum.

The main function creates a vector lst with the elements {1,2,3}. It then calls the sum_squares() function with lst as the argument and prints the result.

The output of the program will be 6, which is the sum of the squares of the elements at indices 0 and 2 (since 0 is not a multiple of 4), and the sum of the cubes of the elements at indices 3 and 6 (since 3 is not a multiple of 3 or 4). The element at index 1 is not changed since its index is not a multiple of 3 or 4. The element at index 4 is also not changed since its index is not a multiple of 3 or 4. The sum of the elements is 1 + 2 + 9 = 6. C:
