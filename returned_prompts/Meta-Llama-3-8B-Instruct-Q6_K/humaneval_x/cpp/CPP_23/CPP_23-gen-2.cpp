This C++ program calculates the length of a given string using a function `strlen()` and then prints it. The function `strlen()` iterates through the string and increments a counter for each character. The counter is then returned as the length of the string.

In the `main()` function, the user is prompted to enter a string, and the length of the string is calculated and printed.

The output of the program will be the length of the input string.

Example:

```
Enter a string: abc
Length of the string is: 3
```

In this example, the input string is "abc" and the length of the string is 3.
