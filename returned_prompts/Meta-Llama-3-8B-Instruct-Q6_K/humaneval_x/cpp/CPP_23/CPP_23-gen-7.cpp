Answer:
The problem is asking you to write a function that returns the length of a given string.

Here is a simple solution using a for loop to iterate over the string and count the number of characters:

```cpp
#include<stdio.h>
#include<string>
using namespace std;

int strlen(string str){
    int length = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++){
        length++;
    }
    return length;
}

int main()
{
    string str;
    cin>>str;
    cout<<"Length of given string is :"<<strlen(str);
    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a function `strlen` that takes a string as input and returns its length. In the `main` function, it reads a string from the input, calls the `strlen` function to get its length, and then prints the result.

The output of this program will be the length of the input string. For example, if you input "abc", the output will be "Length of given string is :3". If you input an empty string, the output will be "Length of given string is :0". 

Note that this code is not very efficient for large strings, as it uses a for loop to count the characters. A more efficient solution would be to use the `length` function provided by the `string` class, like this:

```cpp
int strlen(string str){
    return str.length();
}
```

This code is much simpler and more efficient, as it uses a built-in function to get the length of the string. However, it still does not handle the case of an empty string correctly, as the `length` function returns 0 for an empty string. To handle this case, you could add a special check at the beginning of the function:

```cpp
int strlen(string str){
    if(str.empty()){
        return 0;
    }
    return str.length();
}
```
