The function `simplify` takes two string parameters `x` and `n`, which represent fractions in the format `numerator/denominator`. It uses the `sscanf` function to extract the numerator and denominator from each string and then calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two denominators. It then divides both the numerator and denominator of each fraction by the GCD to simplify the fractions.

The function then checks if the simplified numerator of `x` multiplied by the simplified denominator of `n` is equal to the simplified numerator of `n` multiplied by the simplified denominator of `x`. If this condition is true, the function returns `true`, indicating that the product of the two fractions is a whole number. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

In the `main` function, three test cases are provided to demonstrate the functionality of the `simplify` function.

Here is the corrected code:
```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<string>
using namespace std;

bool simplify(string x, string n) {
    int a, b, c, d;
    sscanf(x.c_str(), "%d/%d", &a, &b);
    sscanf(n.c_str(), "%d/%d", &c, &d);

    int gcd = 1;
    for (int i = 2; i <= a && i <= c; i++) {
        if (a % i == 0 && c % i == 0) {
            gcd = i;
        }
    }
    a /= gcd;
    c /= gcd
