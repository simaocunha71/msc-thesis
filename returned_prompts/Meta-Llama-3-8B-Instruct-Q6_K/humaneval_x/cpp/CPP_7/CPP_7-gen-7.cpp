Explanation:
The problem is asking to create a function that filters an input vector of strings and returns a new vector containing only the strings that contain a given substring.

In the provided code, the function `filter_by_substring` takes two parameters: a vector of strings and a substring. It iterates over each string in the input vector and checks if the substring is present in the string using the `find` method. If the substring is found, the string is added to the result vector.

In the `main` function, a vector of strings is created and a substring is defined. The `filter_by_substring` function is called with these parameters, and the resulting vector is printed to the console.

The output of the program will be:
```
abc
bacd
vector
```
These are the strings that contain the substring "a". The other strings in the input vector do not contain the substring "a" and are not included in the result.
