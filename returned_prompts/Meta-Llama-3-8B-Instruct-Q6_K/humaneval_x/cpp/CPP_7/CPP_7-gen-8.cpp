The time complexity of this solution is O(n*m) where n is the number of strings in the input vector and m is the maximum length of a string in the input vector. This is because in the worst-case scenario, we need to iterate over each character in each string to check if the substring is present. The space complexity is O(n) as we are storing the filtered strings in a new vector.
