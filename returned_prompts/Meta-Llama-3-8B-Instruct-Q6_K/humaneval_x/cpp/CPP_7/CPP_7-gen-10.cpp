Final Output: [abc, bacd, vector]

Explanation: 
The provided C++ code is designed to filter a given input vector of strings and retain only those strings that contain a specific substring. The function "filter_by_substring" takes two parameters: a vector of strings and a string representing the substring to be searched. It iterates over each string in the input vector, checks if the string contains the substring using the "find" method, and if it does, adds the string to the filtered vector. Finally, the function returns the filtered vector. In the main function, a vector of strings is created, a substring is specified, and the result of filtering the strings is printed. The output shows the filtered strings that contain the specified substring. 
The time complexity of this code is O(n*m) where n is the number of strings in the input vector and m is the length of the longest string in the input vector, as the "find" method has a linear time complexity. The space complexity is O(n) as it needs to store the filtered strings in the output vector. 
This code can be improved by using a more efficient search algorithm or data structure, such as a trie or a suffix tree, which can reduce the time complexity of the search operation. 
However, for small input sizes, this code is efficient and easy to understand, making it suitable for many practical applications.
