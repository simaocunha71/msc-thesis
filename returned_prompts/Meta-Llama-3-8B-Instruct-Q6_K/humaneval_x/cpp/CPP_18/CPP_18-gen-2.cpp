The provided code is a simple implementation of a string search algorithm, specifically the Naive algorithm for pattern searching. The algorithm iterates over the main string and checks if the substring matches at each position. If a match is found, it increments the count. The code is correct and should work as expected.

However, it's worth noting that this algorithm has a time complexity of O(n*m), where n is the length of the main string and m is the length of the substring. This can be slow for large strings or substrings. There are more efficient algorithms available, such as the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm or the Rabin-Karp algorithm, which have a time complexity of O(n+m) or O(n) respectively. But for small inputs, the Naive algorithm should be sufficient.
