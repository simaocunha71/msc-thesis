Explanation:

The given problem is to find the coordinates of a given integer `x` in a 2D vector `lst`. The coordinates are represented as a pair of integers, where the first integer is the row index and the second integer is the column index. The rows are sorted in ascending order and the columns within each row are sorted in descending order.

The solution is implemented in the `get_row` function. It iterates over each row in the 2D vector and checks if the current element is equal to `x`. If it is, the coordinates are added to the result vector. After finding all the coordinates, the result vector is sorted based on the row index and then the column index.

In the `main` function, we test the `get_row` function with a sample 2D vector and the integer `x = 1`. The output is the coordinates of `x` in the 2D vector, sorted as required.

The output of the program is:

```
0 0 
1 4 
1 0 
2 5 
2 0 
```

This output shows the coordinates of `x = 1` in the 2D vector, sorted as required. The rows are sorted in ascending order (0, 1, 2) and the columns within each row are sorted in descending order (0, 4, 5).  C++ code with comments:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

// Function to find the coordinates of x in the 2D vector lst
