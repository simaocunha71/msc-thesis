    The function `find_max` iterates over each word in the input vector `words`. For each word, it calculates the number of unique characters by creating a `set` from the characters in the word. If the number of unique characters in the current word is greater than the maximum number of unique characters found so far, it updates the maximum number of unique characters and the corresponding word. If the number of unique characters is equal to the maximum, it checks if the current word is lexicographically smaller than the current maximum word and updates the maximum word if necessary. Finally, the function returns the word with the maximum number of unique characters. If multiple words have the same maximum number of unique characters, the function returns the one that comes first in lexicographical order.

In the `main` function, we create a vector of strings `words` and call the `find_max` function with this vector as an argument. The function returns the word with the maximum number of unique characters, which is then printed to the console. A sample output for the given input would be "string".
