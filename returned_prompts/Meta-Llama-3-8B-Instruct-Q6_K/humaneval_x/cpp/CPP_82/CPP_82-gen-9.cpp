The function `prime_length` checks if the length of a given string is a prime number or not. Here's the corrected code:

```cpp
#include <string>

using namespace std;

bool prime_length(string str) {
    int length = str.length();
    if (length <= 1) {
        return false;
    }
    for (int i = 2; i * i <= length; i++) {
        if (length % i == 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

int main() {
    string str = "Hello";
    cout << prime_length(str) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
1.  We first check if the length of the string is less than or equal to 1. If it is, we immediately return `false` because prime numbers are greater than 1.
2.  We then start a loop from 2 to the square root of the length of the string. This is because a larger factor of the number would be a multiple of a smaller factor that has already been checked.
3.  Inside the loop, we check if the length of the string is divisible by the current number. If it is, we return `false` because the length is not a prime number.
4.  If the loop completes without finding any divisors, we return `true` because the length of the string is a prime number.

This function correctly identifies whether the length of a given string is a prime number or not.
