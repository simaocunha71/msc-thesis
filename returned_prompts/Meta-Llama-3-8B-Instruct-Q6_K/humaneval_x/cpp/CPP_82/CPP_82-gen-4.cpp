Explanation: 
The given problem asks to create a function that takes a string as input and returns true if the length of the string is a prime number, else returns false. 

In the given code, the function prime_length() calculates the length of the string and checks if it is a prime number or not. If the length is less than 2 (since 0 and 1 are not prime numbers), the function returns true. Then it iterates from 2 to half of the length and checks if the length is divisible by any of these numbers. If it finds a divisor, it returns false. If it doesn't find any divisor, it returns true. 

In the main function, we test the function with the given examples and print the results. The output shows that the function is working correctly, returning 1 for strings with prime lengths and 0 for strings with non-prime lengths.
