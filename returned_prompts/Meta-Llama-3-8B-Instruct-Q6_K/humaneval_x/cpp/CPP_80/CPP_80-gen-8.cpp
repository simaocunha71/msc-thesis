R:
The solution is correct. It correctly checks if every 3 consecutive letters in the string are distinct.

Here is the explanation:

1. It first checks if the length of the string is less than 3. If it is, it returns false because a string with less than 3 characters cannot be happy.

2. Then it iterates over the string with a for loop. For each position i in the string, it creates a set st to store the characters in the current window of size 3.

3. It then iterates over the current window of size 3, inserting each character into the set. If the size of the set is not 3 at any point, it means that the current window contains duplicate characters, so it returns false.

4. If the function does not return false after checking all windows, it means that every window of size 3 contains distinct characters, so it returns true.

The main function tests the is_happy function with different input strings and prints the results.
