Solution:
The correct answer is A.

Explanation:
The problem asks to check if two words have the same characters. A simple and efficient approach is to sort the characters in each word and then compare the sorted strings. If the sorted strings are equal, then the original words have the same characters.

The function `same_chars` takes two strings `s0` and `s1` as input, and returns `true` if they have the same characters, and `false` otherwise.

In the `main` function, we test the `same_chars` function with different input pairs and print the results.

Note that the `using namespace std;` directive is used to avoid having to prefix standard library names with `std::`. This is a common practice in C++ programming. However, it's generally considered a good practice to avoid using `using namespace std;` in production code, as it can lead to name conflicts if not used carefully. Instead, you can use the `std::` prefix to access standard library names. For example, `std::sort` instead of `sort`.
