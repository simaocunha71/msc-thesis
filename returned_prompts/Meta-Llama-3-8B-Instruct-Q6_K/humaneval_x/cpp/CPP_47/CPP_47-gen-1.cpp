C++ Code Explanation:

1. The function `median` takes a vector of floating point numbers as input and returns the median of the elements in the vector.

2. The function sorts the elements in the vector using the `sort` function from the `<algorithm>` library.

3. It then checks if the size of the vector (`n`) is odd or even. If it's odd, the median is the middle element of the sorted vector (`l[n/2]`). If it's even, the median is the average of the two middle elements (`(l[n/2-1]+l[n/2])/2.0`).

4. The function returns the calculated median value.

The test cases provided in the problem statement are:

```
>>> median({3, 1, 2, 4, 5})
3
>>> median({-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20})
15.0
```

The output of the function for these test cases would be:

```
3
15.0
```

This code assumes that the input vector is not empty. If the input vector can be empty, you should add a check for that and return a suitable value (e.g., NaN or a special value indicating an error).
