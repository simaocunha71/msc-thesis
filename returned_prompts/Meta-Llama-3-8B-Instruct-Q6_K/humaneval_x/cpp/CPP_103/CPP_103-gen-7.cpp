*/

Solution:
The solution is given in the above code. It first checks if n is greater than m, and if so, returns "-1". Then it calculates the sum of the integers from n to m and calculates the average. It rounds the average to the nearest integer and converts it to binary. The binary representation is constructed by repeatedly dividing the integer by 2 and prepending the remainder to the result string. If the string is empty after conversion, it is replaced with "0". The function returns the binary string.

The test cases are also provided in the code. The output of the test cases is as follows:

* rounded_avg(1, 5) => "11"
* rounded_avg(7, 5) => "-1"
* rounded_avg(10, 20) => "1111"
* rounded_avg(20, 33) => "11010"

These outputs match the expected results.
