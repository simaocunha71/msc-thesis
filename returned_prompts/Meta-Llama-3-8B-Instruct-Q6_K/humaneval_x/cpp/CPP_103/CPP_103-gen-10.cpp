Explanation:
The main function calls the rounded_avg function with different input values and prints the returned values.
The rounded_avg function calculates the average of the integers from n to m, rounds it to the nearest integer, and converts it to binary. If n is greater than m, it returns "-1". 
The result is a string representing the binary representation of the rounded average. If n is greater than m, the function returns "-1". 

Complexity:
Time complexity: O(m-n+1) as it iterates through the range of numbers from n to m.
Space complexity: O(m-n+1) as it stores the sum of the numbers in a variable. The binary representation of the rounded average is also stored in a string. 

Note:
The input values n and m are positive integers, and the output is a string representing the binary representation of the rounded average. The function returns "-1" if n is greater than m. 

This problem can be solved using a loop to calculate the sum of the numbers from n to m, then round the average to the nearest integer, and convert it to binary. The binary representation is stored in a string. If n is greater than m, the function returns "-1".
