    int sum = 0;

            sum += arr[i];
        }
    }
    return sum;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> arr = {111,21,3,4000,5,6,7,8,9};

    return 0;
}

Solution:
The problem is asking to find the sum of the elements with at most two digits from the first k elements of arr.
In the given problem, the elements with at most two digits are 21 and 3.

We can use a for loop to iterate over the first k elements of arr. For each element, we can check if the number of digits in the element is less than or equal to 2. If it is, we add the element to the sum.

Here is the C++ code to solve the problem:

```cpp
#include<stdio.h>
#include<vector>
using namespace std;

int add_elements(vector<int> arr,int k){
    int sum = 0;
    for(int i=0;i<k;i++){
        if(log10(arr[i]) <= 2){
            sum += arr[i];
        }
    }
    return sum;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> arr = {111,21,3,4000,5,6,7,8,9};
    int k = 4;
    printf("%d\n",add_elements(arr,k));
    return 0;
}
```

This code will output `24`, which is the sum of 21 and 3. The time complexity of this code is O(k), where k is the number of elements in the array. The space complexity is O(1), as we are using a constant amount of space to store the sum.
