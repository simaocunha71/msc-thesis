Explanation:
The function add_elements takes a vector of integers arr and an integer k as input. It iterates over the first k elements of arr and checks if the number of digits in each element is less than 3 (i.e., the element has at most 2 digits). If it does, it adds the element to the sum. Finally, it returns the sum.

In the main function, we create a vector arr and set k to 4. We then call the add_elements function with these inputs and store the result in the variable result. We print the result to the console.

The output of the program will be 24, which is the sum of the elements with at most 2 digits from the first 4 elements of arr, which are 21 and 3.
