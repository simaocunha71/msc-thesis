    string result = "";
    for (const auto &str : strings) {
        result += str;
    }
    return result;
}

int main() {
    vector<string> strings = {"a", "b", "c"};
    cout << concatenate(strings) << endl;
    return 0;
}

Output:
abc
Explanation:
The function concatenate takes a vector of strings as an input and concatenates all the strings in the vector into a single string. In the main function, we create a vector of strings and pass it to the concatenate function. The output will be "abc", which is the concatenation of the strings in the vector.
