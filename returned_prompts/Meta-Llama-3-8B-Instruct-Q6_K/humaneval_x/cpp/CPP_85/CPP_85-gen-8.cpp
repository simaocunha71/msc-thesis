Explanation:

This code takes a vector of integers as input and returns the sum of the even numbers that are at odd indices.

In the main function, a vector `lst` is created with the elements {4, 2, 6, 7}. The function `add(lst)` is called and the output is printed.

The `add` function iterates over the vector using a for loop. For each element, it checks if the index is odd (i % 2 != 0) and if the element is even (lst[i] % 2 == 0). If both conditions are true, it adds the element to the sum.

In this case, the even numbers at odd indices are 2 and 6, so the sum is 2 + 6 = 8. However, the problem statement asks to add the even numbers that are at odd indices, not the sum of the even numbers. So, the correct output is 2, which is the even number at an odd index in the input vector.
