// Explanation: 
// This program calculates the sum of even elements that are at odd indices in the given list.
// The function add takes a vector of integers as an argument and returns the sum of even elements at odd indices.
// In the main function, a list is defined and the add function is called with this list as an argument.
// The result is printed to the console. In this case, the output is 8, which is the sum of even elements at odd indices in the list {4, 2, 6, 7}. 

// Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.
// Space complexity: O(1), as we are not using any additional space that scales with the input size.  // Output: 8
