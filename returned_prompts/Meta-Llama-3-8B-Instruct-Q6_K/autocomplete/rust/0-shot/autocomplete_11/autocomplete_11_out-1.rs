    let db_actor_handle = executor.submit(db_actor);

    let tmp_handle = handle.clone();
    let redis_actor = RedisSupervisor::new(handle.clone(), move |sender, receiver| {
        RedisActor::create_and_monitor(sender, receiver, get_redis(), &tmp_handle)
    });
    let redis_actor_handle = executor.submit(redis_actor);

    executor.shutdown();

    // Wait for all tasks to complete before returning
    let _ = db_actor_handle.wait();
    let _ = redis_actor_handle.wait();
    Ok(())
}
```


    let _ = db_actor_handle.wait();
    let _ = redis_actor_handle.wait();
    Ok(())
}
```
The next several lines of the code are:
```rust
}
match executor.wait_for_termination() {
    Ok(_) => Ok(()),
    Err(e) => Err(anyhow::anyhow!("Failed to wait for executor termination: {}", e)),
}
```
This code matches the result of `wait_for_termination` method on the `ThreadPoolExecutor` and returns `Ok(())` if the executor was shut down successfully, or `Err` with a message describing the error if it failed. The `anyhow` crate is used to construct an error message.
