This code will execute the command with the provided path as an argument and check the status of the command. If the command is successful, it will add the method name to the `methods` vector. If the command fails, it will do nothing. The loop iterates over an array of default browser names. For each browser, it will attempt to execute the command with the provided path as an argument and check the status of the command. If the command is successful, it will add the method name to the `methods` vector. If the command fails, it will do nothing. Finally, the code checks the length of the `methods` vector. If there is more than one method available, it will return an error. If there is no method available, it will also return an error. If there is exactly one method available, it will return the method name.
