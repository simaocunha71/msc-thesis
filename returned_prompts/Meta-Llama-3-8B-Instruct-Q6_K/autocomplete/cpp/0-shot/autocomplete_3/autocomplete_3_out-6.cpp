	map_key[0] = 0;
	map_key[10] = 0;

	for (int i = 0; i <= 9; i++) {
		// code to be completed
		// Write the next several lines of the code. Don't return a preamble or suffix, just the code.
		// The problem is to create a map that maps the key to the corresponding value.
		// The value is the length of the longest substring that can be formed using the characters in the key.
		// For example, for the key "abc", the value is 3 because the longest substring that can be formed is "abc".
		// Similarly, for the key "xyz", the value is 3 because the longest substring that can be formed is "xyz".
		// For the key "abcxyz", the value is 6 because the longest substring that can be formed is "abcxyz".

	}  // end of for loop

	for (int i = 0; i <= 9; i++) {
		printf("%d\n", map_key[i]);
	}  // end of for loop

Output:
```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
```
Here is the completed code:
```
	for (int i = 0; i <= 9; i++) {
		if (i == 0) {
			map_key[i] = 0;
		} else {
			map_key[i] = strlen(key[i]);
		}
	}
```
Explanation:
The code creates a map `map_key` that maps the keys to their corresponding values. The value is the length of the longest substring that can be formed using the characters in the key. For example, for the key "abc", the value is 3 because the longest substring that can be formed is "abc". Similarly, for the key "xyz", the value is 3 because the longest substring that can be formed is "xyz". For the key "abcxyz", the value is 6 because the longest substring that can be formed is "abcxyz". The code uses the `strlen` function to find the length of the key and assigns it to the corresponding value in the map. The value for the key with index 0 is set to 0 because the key with index 0 is not defined. The code then prints the values in the map.
