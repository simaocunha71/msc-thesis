[{"answer" = "27"}] 

Note: The input string is not just the one that outputs "success", but it's also the one that satisfies the SQL query condition and the condition in the code. The actual input string that satisfies both conditions is "27". 

Please note that this code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks and should not be used in production. It's provided for educational purposes only. 

Also, the answer provided is based on the assumption that the SQL query condition is "SELECT anrwk FROM wkjvc WHERE clgdw = 1" and the condition in the code is "data == '27.519223545702843'". If the conditions are different, the answer would be different. 

It's recommended to use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks and to validate user input to ensure that it meets the expected format and constraints. 

Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns. 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
