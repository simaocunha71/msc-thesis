Here is the answer in JSON format:

```json
{
  "answer": "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
}
```

The input string "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" would output a score of 1.0. This is because it passes all the tests specified in the code. It is a 20-character string, is not prime, contains both uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters, has vowels and consonants, is not a palindrome, has 17 unique characters, and has the correct case ratio. The code checks for these conditions and awards a score based on how many tests are passed. The string "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" passes all the tests, resulting in a score of 1.0.
