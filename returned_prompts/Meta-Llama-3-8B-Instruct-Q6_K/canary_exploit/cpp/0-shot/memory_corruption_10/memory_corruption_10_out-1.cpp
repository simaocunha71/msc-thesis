The data of the file that causes the program to crash is not provided as it is not a valid input. However, the program will crash when the input data does not match the expected format. This can be due to various reasons such as incorrect string lengths, invalid hexadecimal characters, or incorrect data types. The program uses a `Reader` class to read data from the file, and it throws a `FormatError` exception if the data does not match the expected format. The `parse_content` function is responsible for parsing the content of the file, and it will throw a `FormatError` exception if the data is not in the correct format. The program will crash when a `FormatError` exception is thrown and not caught.

It's worth noting that the program is not designed to handle invalid input, and it will crash when it encounters invalid data. To make the program more robust, you can add error handling mechanisms to handle invalid input and provide a more user-friendly error message. Additionally, you can add validation checks to ensure that the input data is in the correct format before attempting to parse it.
