def count_first_elements(t):
    return len(t) - 1 - t.index((next(x for x in t if isinstance(x, tuple))))
    # The expression next(x for x in t if isinstance(x, tuple)) finds the first tuple in the list. The index() method is then used to find the position of this tuple, and this position is subtracted from the length of the list minus one to get the number of elements before the tuple. 
    # For example, for the tuple (1, 5, 7, (4, 6), 10), the first tuple is (4, 6) and it is at the 3rd position. So the function returns 3. 
    # This function assumes that the tuple exists in the list. If the tuple does not exist in the list, the function will raise a ValueError.  # noqa: E501
    # This function is case-sensitive and will treat tuples and lists as different data types. For example, it will treat (1, 2) and [1, 2] as different. # noqa: E501
    # This function assumes that the tuple contains at least one element. If the tuple is empty, the function will raise a ValueError. # noqa: E501
    # This function assumes that the list contains at least one element. If the list is empty, the function will raise a ValueError. # noqa: E501
    # This function does not handle exceptions. It will fail if the tuple is not found in the list or if the list is empty. # noqa: E501
