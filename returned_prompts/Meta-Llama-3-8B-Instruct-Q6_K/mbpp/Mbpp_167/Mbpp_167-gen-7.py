```
def next_power_of_2(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 1
    return 2 ** (n - 1).bit_length()
```


The unit test `assert next_power_of_2(0) == 1` helps to clarify the problem by showing that the function should return 1 when the input is 0. This means that the function should return the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to the input.

The solution uses the built-in `bit_length` method of Python integers, which returns the number of bits necessary to represent the integer in binary. This can be used to find the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to the input.

If the input is 0 or negative, the function returns 1, as the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to 0 is 1. This is handled by the `if` statement at the beginning of the function.

The function then uses the `**` operator to raise 2 to the power of the result of the `bit_length` method, which gives the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to the input. This is returned as the result of the function.
