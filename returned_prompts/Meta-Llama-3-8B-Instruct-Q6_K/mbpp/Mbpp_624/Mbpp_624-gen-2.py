```
def convert_to_uppercase(s):
    return s.upper()
```


The unit test provided is `assert is_upper("person") =="PERSON"`. This test suggests that the function should take a string as input and return the uppercase version of that string. 

In Python, the `upper()` function is a built-in method that can be used to convert a string to uppercase. Therefore, we can write the function as follows:

```
def convert_to_uppercase(s):
    return s.upper()
```

This function takes a string `s` as input, and returns the uppercase version of `s` using the `upper()` method. The unit test provided should pass with this function.
