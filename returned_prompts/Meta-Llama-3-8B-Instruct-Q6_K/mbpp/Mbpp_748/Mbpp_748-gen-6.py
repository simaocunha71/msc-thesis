"""
The problem is to write a function that takes a string as input and returns the same string but with spaces added between words that start with capital letters. However, there is a catch - the function should not add spaces to words that are already single capital letters.

Looking at the unit test `assert capital_words_spaces("Python") == 'Python'`, we can see that the function should not add a space to the word "Python" because it is a single capital letter. This means the function should only add spaces between words that consist of multiple capital letters.

Here is a Python function that solves this problem:

```
def capital_words_spaces(s):
    result = ""
    for i, c in enumerate(s):
        if i > 0 and c.isupper() and s[i-1].islower():
            result += " "
        result += c
    return result
```

This function iterates over the input string and checks if the current character is uppercase and the previous character is lowercase. If this condition is true, it adds a space to the result string. Otherwise, it just appends the character to the result string. The function finally returns the resulting string. """
