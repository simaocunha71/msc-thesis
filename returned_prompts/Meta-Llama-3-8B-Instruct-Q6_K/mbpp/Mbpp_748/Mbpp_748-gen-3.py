def capital_words_spaces(s):

# The unit test provided in the problem statement suggests that the function should not put spaces between words starting with capital letters. It seems that the problem statement is incorrect or incomplete. 

# If we assume that the problem statement is correct, we need to put spaces between words starting with capital letters. However, the problem does not specify what to do with the remaining parts of the string. 

# In this case, we can put a space after each capital letter, but it will not be a correct solution because it will not form a valid sentence. 

# We can also consider that the function should not put spaces between words starting with capital letters, and in this case, the function should return the original string. This is the solution provided in the problem. 

# The unit test provided in the problem statement is also incorrect because it does not cover the edge cases. For example, it does not cover the case where the input string is empty or contains only one word. 

# In a real-world scenario, we would need to consider these edge cases and provide a correct solution. 

# The correct solution would be to put a space after each capital letter, but only if the capital letter is not at the beginning of the string. If the capital letter is at the beginning of the string, we should not put a space before it. 

# Here is the correct solution:
def capital_words_spaces(s):
    result = ''
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if i > 0 and s[i].isupper():
            result += ' ' + s[i]
        else:
            result += s[i]
    return result
# This solution will put a space after each capital letter, but only if the capital letter is not at the beginning of the string. If the capital letter is at the beginning of the string, it will not put a space before it. This is the correct solution for the problem.
