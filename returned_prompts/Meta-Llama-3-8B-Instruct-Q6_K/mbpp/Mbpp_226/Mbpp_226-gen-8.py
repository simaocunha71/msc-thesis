def odd_values_string(s):
    return ''.join([c for i, c in enumerate(s) if i % 2 == 0])
```
The given problem is asking to remove the characters which have odd index values of a given string. This problem can be solved by using a list comprehension in Python. The `enumerate` function is used to iterate over the string along with their indices. The condition `i % 2 == 0` is used to filter out the characters with odd index values. Finally, the `join` function is used to concatenate the characters into a string.

For example, if the input string is 'abcdef', the function will return 'ace' because these characters are at even index positions. The characters 'b', 'd', and 'f' are at odd index positions and are removed from the output string. 

The unit test `assert odd_values_string('abcdef') == 'ace'` also confirms this.  It checks if the output of the function `odd_values_string('abcdef')` is equal to 'ace', which is the expected result.  If the function is implemented correctly, this test should pass.  This unit test provides a way to verify that the function is working correctly.  If the function is not working correctly, the test will fail, indicating that there is a bug in the function.  This helps to ensure that the function is working correctly and provides a way to quickly identify and fix bugs.  Unit tests can be very helpful in ensuring that a function is working correctly and can save a lot of time and effort in the long run.  They can also be very useful in ensuring that a function is working correctly after changes are made to the code.  This can be especially important in large and complex projects where it can be difficult to manually test every part of the code.  In these situations, unit tests can provide a way to automatically test the code and ensure that it is working correctly.  This can save a lot of time and effort and can help to ensure that the code is working correctly.  Unit tests are an important part of software development and can be very helpful in ensuring that a function is working correctly.
