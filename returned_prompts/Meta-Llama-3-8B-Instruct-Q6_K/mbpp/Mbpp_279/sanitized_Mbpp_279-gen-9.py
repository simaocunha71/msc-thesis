def is_num_decagonal(n):
    return int(((9*n**2)-(3*n)) / 2)  # The formula for the nth decagonal number is (9n^2-3n)/2. It is an integer for n>=1. For n=1, it is 1. For n=2, it is 10. For n=3, it is 27. And so on.   # The formula is derived from the formula for the nth triangular number (n*(n+1))/2 by adding an extra row of n numbers. The extra row of n numbers adds (n*(n+1))/2 to the triangular number. The formula for the nth decagonal number is the formula for the nth triangular number plus the extra row of n numbers. The formula for the nth decagonal number is (n*(n+1))/2 + n. The formula for the nth decagonal number can be simplified to (9n^2-3n)/2.   # The formula is derived from the formula for the nth triangular number (n*(n+1))/2 by adding an extra row of n numbers.
