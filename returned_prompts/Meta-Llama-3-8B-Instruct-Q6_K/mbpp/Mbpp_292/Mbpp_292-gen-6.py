```
def find(a, b):
    return a // b
```
The problem is asking for a function that takes two numbers as input and returns the quotient of these two numbers, rounded down to the nearest integer.

In Python, the floor division operator `//` is used to perform the floor division operation, which returns the quotient of the division, rounded down to the nearest integer.

The unit test `assert find(10,3) == 3` confirms that the function should return the quotient of the division, which in this case is 3.

The function can be written as follows:
```
def find(a, b):
    return a // b
```


This function takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, and returns the result of the floor division of `a` by `b`. The `//` operator is used to perform the floor division operation. The result is an integer, rounded down to the nearest integer. The function can be used to find the quotient of two numbers, as shown in the unit test.
