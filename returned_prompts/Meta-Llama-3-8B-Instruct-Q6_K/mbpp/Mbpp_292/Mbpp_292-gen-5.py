```
def find(a, b):
    return a // b
```
The problem is asking to write a function that takes two numbers as input and returns the quotient of those numbers, rounded down to the nearest integer. 

The unit test provided, `assert find(10,3) == 3`, suggests that the function should return the integer part of the division, which is the quotient rounded down.

In Python, the `//` operator performs integer division, which means it returns the quotient of the division rounded down to the nearest integer. Therefore, the solution is a simple function that returns the result of the division using the `//` operator. 

For example, `find(10,3)` would return `3`, which is the quotient of `10` and `3` rounded down to the nearest integer. 

The function `find(a, b)` takes two arguments `a` and `b`, and returns the result of the division `a // b`. The `//` operator performs integer division, which is what we need to solve the problem. 

The function does not need any additional logic to round the result down, as the `//` operator already does this. Therefore, the function is very simple and easy to understand. 

Here is the complete solution:
```
def find(a, b):
    return a // b
```
