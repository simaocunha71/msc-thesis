def find(a, b):
    return a // b
```


Explanation:
This problem is asking to write a function that takes two numbers as input and returns the quotient of those numbers. The quotient is the result of the division operation. 

The problem doesn't specify what to do with the decimal part of the result. However, based on the unit test `assert find(10,3) == 3`, we can infer that the quotient should be rounded down to the nearest integer.

The `//` operator in Python performs integer division, which returns the quotient and ignores the remainder. Therefore, the function `find(a, b)` can be implemented as `return a // b`. This function will return the quotient of `a` and `b` rounded down to the nearest integer. 

For example, `find(10, 3)` will return `3` because `10 // 3` is `3`. Similarly, `find(10, 2)` will return `5` because `10 // 2` is `5`. 

The function will work correctly for any two integers `a` and `b` as long as `b` is non-zero. If `b` is zero, the function will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` because division by zero is undefined. 

The unit test `assert find(10,3) == 3` ensures that the function is working correctly for the case where the quotient is an integer. If the function is implemented correctly, this test will pass. 

The time complexity of this function is O(1) because it only performs a constant number of operations. The space complexity is also O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the result.
