```
def find(a, b):
    return a // b
```


Explanation:
The problem is asking for a Python function that finds the quotient of two numbers and rounds it down to the nearest integer. 

The given unit test `assert find(10,3) == 3` suggests that the quotient should be rounded down, which means we can use the integer division operator `//` to get the quotient. 

The function `find(a, b)` takes two parameters `a` and `b` and returns the quotient of `a` divided by `b`. 

For example, `find(10, 3)` will return `3`, which is the quotient of `10` divided by `3` rounded down. 

This solution passes the given unit test. 

Note: The `//` operator performs integer division, which means it returns the quotient without considering the remainder. This is suitable for this problem since we want to round the quotient down to the nearest integer. 

If we wanted to round the quotient up or use a different rounding method, we would need to use a different approach. For example, if we wanted to round the quotient up, we could use the `math.ceil` function from the `math` module. If we wanted to round the quotient to the nearest integer, we could use the `round` function. However, these approaches would require additional code and would not be suitable for this specific problem.
