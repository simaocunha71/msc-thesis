The Bell numbers are a sequence of integers that are defined recursively. They are named after Eric Temple Bell, and they count the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into non-empty subsets.

The Bell numbers are defined as follows:

* B(0) = 1
* B(n) = Î£(B(k) * B(n-k-1)) for n > 0

Here is a Python function that calculates the nth Bell number:

```
def bell_Number(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return sum(bell_Number(k) * bell_Number(n-k-1) for k in range(n))
```

This function uses a recursive approach to calculate the Bell numbers. It works by summing up the product of the (k)th Bell number and the (n-k-1)th Bell number for all values of k from 0 to n. The base case is when n is 0, in which case the function returns 1.

The unit test `assert bell_Number(2) == 2` ensures that the function is working correctly. It checks that the 2nd Bell number is indeed 2, which is the correct value. 

Please note that the function may not be efficient for large values of n, as it uses a recursive approach that can be slow for large inputs. For larger values of n, a more efficient approach such as using dynamic programming may be needed. 





```
def bell_Number(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return sum(bell_Number(k) * bell_Number(n-k-1) for k in range(n))

assert bell_Number(2) == 2
```





```
def bell_Number(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return sum(bell_Number(k) * bell_Number(n-k-1) for k in range(n))

assert bell_Number(2) == 2
```





```
def bell_Number(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return sum(bell_Number(k) * bell_Number(n-k-1) for k in range(n))

assert bell_Number(2) == 2
```





```
def bell_Number(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return sum(bell_Number(k) * bell_Number(n-k-1) for k in range(n))
