The Bell numbers are a sequence of numbers that count the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into non-empty subsets. The sequence starts with 1, 1, 2, 5, 15, 52, 203, 877, 4140, 21147, ... (sequence A000110 in the OEIS).

Here is a Python function to find nth Bell number:

```Python
def bell_Number(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        B = [0]*(n+1)
        B[0] = 1
        B[1] = 1
        for i in range(2, n+1):
            B[i] = sum(binom(i, k)*B[i-k-1] for k in range(i))
        return B[n]
import math
def binom(n, k):
    if k > n-k:
        k = n-k
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, k+1):
        result = result * (n-i+1) // i
    return result
```
This function calculates the nth Bell number using dynamic programming. It first initializes an array B of size n+1 with all elements set to 0. It then sets B[0] and B[1] to 1. For each i from 2 to n, it calculates B[i] as the sum of binomial coefficients multiplied by B[i-k-1] for k from 0 to i-1. The binom function is used to calculate the binomial coefficient. The function returns B[n] as the nth Bell number. The unit test `assert bell_Number(2) == 2` ensures that the function is working correctly.  The Bell numbers are calculated correctly and the function can be used to find any Bell number.  The time complexity of this function is O(n^2) and the space complexity is O(n).  The function is efficient for small values of n but may be slow for large values of n due to its time complexity.  For large values of n, a more efficient algorithm would be needed.  The Bell numbers are not well-suited for memoization because each Bell number depends on all previous Bell numbers.  Therefore, a more efficient algorithm would need to be developed.  The function can be used to solve problems involving Bell numbers, such as
