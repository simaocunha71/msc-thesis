This function calculates the sum of the product of consecutive binomial coefficients. It does this by iterating over the range from 1 to n (inclusive), and for each iteration, it calculates the product of the binomial coefficients from 0 to i (inclusive). It then adds this product to the running sum. The function returns the final sum.

The unit test `assert sum_Of_product(3) == 15` checks that the function correctly calculates the sum of the product of consecutive binomial coefficients for n=3, which is 1*2 + 1*1 + 1 = 15. This test passes, indicating that the function is working correctly. 

Note that the function uses the formula for binomial coefficients: `n choose k = n! / (k!(n-k)!)`, where `n!` is the factorial of `n`. In this case, we are calculating the product of consecutive binomial coefficients, which is equivalent to calculating the product of the binomial coefficients for each value of `k` from 0 to `i`. This is implemented in the inner loop of the function. 

The time complexity of this function is O(n^2), as it has a nested loop structure. The space complexity is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the running sum and the product. 

This function is efficient for small values of `n`, but for larger values, it may be slow due to its O(n^2) time complexity. For larger values of `n`, a more efficient algorithm or data structure may be needed.
