The provided unit test suggests that the sum is calculated for the product of consecutive binomial coefficients for all combinations of n and r up to a certain number n. 

This problem can be solved by iterating over all combinations of n and r and calculating the binomial coefficient. The binomial coefficient is calculated using the formula nCk = n! / (k!(n-k)!). 

The unit test `assert sum_Of_product(3) == 15` suggests that the sum is calculated for the product of consecutive binomial coefficients for all combinations of n and r up to 3. 

The function `sum_Of_product(n)` calculates the sum of the product of consecutive binomial coefficients for all combinations of n and r up to n. The function `binom(n, k)` calculates the binomial coefficient nCk. 

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) due to the nested loops and the calculation of binomial coefficients. The space complexity is O(1) as it only uses a constant amount of space. 

The provided solution does not handle the case where k > n - k. In this case, the binomial coefficient is equal to the binomial coefficient nC(n-k). This is because nCk = nC(n-k). 

The solution is modified to handle this case by checking if k > n - k and if so, set k to n - k. This ensures that the binomial coefficient is calculated correctly. 

The binomial coefficient is calculated using the formula nCk = n! / (k!(n-k)!). This formula is implemented in the function `binom(n, k)`. The result is then returned as an integer.
