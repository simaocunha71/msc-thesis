This function calculates the sum of the product of consecutive binomial coefficients. The binom function calculates the binomial coefficient `n choose k`. The sum is calculated by iterating over all possible combinations of binomial coefficients and adding them up. The unit test `assert sum_Of_product(3) == 15` confirms the correctness of the function. 

The binom function uses the formula for binomial coefficients and takes advantage of the symmetry of binomial coefficients to reduce the number of calculations. This makes the function more efficient. 

The function `sum_Of_product` returns the sum of the product of consecutive binomial coefficients for a given `n`. The unit test `assert sum_Of_product(3) == 15` confirms the correctness of the function. 

The time complexity of this function is O(n^2) as it has two nested loops. The space complexity is O(1) as it only uses a constant amount of space.
