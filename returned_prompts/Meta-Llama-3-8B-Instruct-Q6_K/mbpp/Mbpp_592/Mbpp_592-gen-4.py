Explanation:
The problem is asking to find the sum of the product of consecutive binomial co-efficients. We can define a function `sum_Of_product` to calculate this sum for a given number `n`. Inside this function, we iterate from `1` to `n` and for each `i`, we calculate the product of `i` and the binomial coefficient `i` choose `n` using the `binomial_coefficient` function. We add this product to the result and finally return the result.

The `binomial_coefficient` function calculates the binomial coefficient `k` choose `n` using the formula `n! / (k!(n-k)!)`. We use this function to calculate the binomial coefficient in the `sum_Of_product` function. We also use the property of binomial coefficients that `n choose k` is equal to `n choose (n-k)` if `k > n/2` to reduce the number of calculations.

The unit test `assert sum_Of_product(3) == 15` ensures that the function is working correctly for the input `n = 3`. The output of the function for `n = 3` is indeed `15`, which is the sum of the product of consecutive binomial co-efficients for `n = 3`.
