The function calculates the sum of the product of consecutive binomial coefficients. The binomial coefficient is calculated using the formula (n choose k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!) = n! / (k!(n-k)!). The function uses a nested loop to calculate the binomial coefficient for each combination and adds it to the total sum. The result is the sum of the product of consecutive binomial coefficients. 

The unit test `assert sum_Of_product(3) == 15` checks if the function returns the correct result for the input 3. The expected result is 15, which is the sum of the product of consecutive binomial coefficients for 3. 

This function works for any positive integer n. For larger values of n, the calculation may take a significant amount of time due to the factorial terms in the binomial coefficient calculation. 

The time complexity of this function is O(n^2) because it uses a nested loop to calculate the binomial coefficient for each combination. The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the variables. 





This function can be optimized by using the fact that the binomial coefficient can be calculated using the formula (n choose k) = (n-1 choose k-1) + (n-1 choose k). This formula can be used to avoid calculating the binomial coefficient for each combination from scratch, which can significantly reduce the time complexity of the function. 

Here is the optimized function:

```
def sum_Of_product(n):
    total_sum = 0
    binomial_coefficient = 1
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        binomial_coefficient = (n-i+1) / i * binomial_coefficient
        total_sum += binomial_coefficient
    return total_sum
```

This function uses the formula to calculate the binomial coefficient for each combination and adds it to the total sum. The time complexity of this function is O(n) because it only needs to calculate the binomial coefficient for each combination once. The space complexity is still
