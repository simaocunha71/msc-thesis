In this function, we first initialize two arrays to store the maximum sum of increasing and decreasing subsequences. Then we iterate over the array to fill these two arrays. The maximum sum is updated at each step by taking the maximum of the current sum and the sum of the current increasing and decreasing subsequences. Finally, we return the maximum sum. This function assumes that the input array has at least two elements. If the array has less than two elements, the function returns the maximum element in the array. This is because a sequence with less than two elements cannot be bitonic. The unit test `assert max_sum([1, 15, 51, 45, 33, 100, 12, 18, 9]) == 194` ensures that the function works correctly. 

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input array. This is because we iterate over the array twice. The space complexity is O(n), as we use two arrays of size n to store the maximum sum of increasing and decreasing subsequences.
