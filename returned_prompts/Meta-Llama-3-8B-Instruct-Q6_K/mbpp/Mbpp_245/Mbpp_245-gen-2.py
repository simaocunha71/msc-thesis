Explanation:
The function `max_sum` takes an array `arr` as input and returns the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence. It first checks if the array is empty, in which case it returns 0. If the array has only one element, it returns that element. If the array has only two elements, it returns the maximum of the two elements.

It then initializes two arrays, `increasing` and `decreasing`, to store the maximum sum of increasing and decreasing subsequences ending at each position, respectively.

The function then iterates over the array, updating `increasing` and `decreasing` arrays. For `increasing`, it keeps track of the maximum sum of increasing subsequences ending at each position, and for `decreasing`, it keeps track of the maximum sum of decreasing subsequences ending at each position.

Finally, the function iterates over the array again, calculating the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence by taking the maximum of the sum of the increasing subsequence ending at each position, the sum of the decreasing subsequence starting at each position, and the element at each position. The maximum sum is returned as the result.

The unit test `assert max_sum([1, 15, 51, 45, 33, 100, 12, 18, 9]) == 194` ensures that the function works correctly. The expected output is 194, which is the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence in the given array. The function passes this test, indicating that it is working correctly.
