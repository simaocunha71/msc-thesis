The problem is to write a function that finds the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence for a given array. A sequence is bitonic if it is first increasing and then decreasing.

The function `max_sum` takes an array as input and returns the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence. It uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. The dynamic programming table `dp` stores the maximum sum of bitonic subsequences ending at each position.

The function first initializes the table `dp` with zeros. Then, it fills the table in a bottom-up manner. For each subsequence ending at position `j`, it finds the maximum sum by considering all possible predecessors at position `k` and adding the difference between the current element and the previous element. Finally, it returns the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence, which is the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence ending at any position.

The unit test `assert max_sum([1, 15, 51, 45, 33, 100, 12, 18, 9]) == 194` ensures that the function returns the correct result for the given input. The expected output is 194, which is the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence for the given array.
