The function works by first initializing two arrays, `increasing` and `decreasing`, to store the maximum sum of increasing and decreasing subsequences respectively. It then iterates over the array from left to right to fill up the `increasing` array and from right to left to fill up the `decreasing` array. Finally, it returns the sum of `increasing` and `decreasing` arrays minus the maximum element in the array, as the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence cannot include the maximum element. This is verified by the unit test `assert max_sum([1, 15, 51, 45, 33, 100, 12, 18, 9]) == 194`.  This function runs in O(n) time, where n is the length of the input array.  The space complexity is also O(n) as it requires extra space to store the `increasing` and `decreasing` arrays.  The time complexity is linear as it only requires a single pass over the array.  The space complexity is also linear as it requires space to store the `increasing` and `decreasing` arrays.  The function can be optimized by storing the maximum sum of increasing and decreasing subsequences in a single pass over the array, reducing the space complexity to O(1).  However, this would increase the time complexity to O(n) as we would need to make two passes over the array.  The current implementation has a trade-off between time and space complexity.  It is efficient in terms of time complexity but requires extra space to store the `increasing` and `decreasing` arrays.  If space complexity is a concern, the function can be optimized to reduce the space complexity at the cost of increasing the time complexity.  However, the current implementation is
