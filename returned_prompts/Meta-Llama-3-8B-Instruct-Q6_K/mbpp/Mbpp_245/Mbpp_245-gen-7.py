The function `max_sum` takes an array as input and returns the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence. It initializes two arrays `inc` and `dec` to keep track of the maximum increasing and decreasing subsequences ending at each position, respectively. Then, it iterates over the array to fill up these arrays. Finally, it returns the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence by iterating over the array and adding the maximum increasing and decreasing subsequences ending at each position. The maximum sum is updated at each position. The function returns the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence. 

The unit test `assert max_sum([1, 15, 51, 45, 33, 100, 12, 18, 9]) == 194` ensures that the function works correctly. 

This function has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested loops. The space complexity is O(n) for the `inc` and `dec` arrays. 

Note: The problem statement is unclear about what to do if there are multiple bitonic subsequences with the same maximum sum. The function returns the maximum sum of any bitonic subsequence, not necessarily the first one. If the problem requires returning all maximum sums, the function needs to be modified accordingly.
