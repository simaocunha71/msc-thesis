def count_divisors(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if n % i == 0:

Explanation:
The problem asks to create a function that checks if the count of divisors of a given number is even. The function should take an integer as input and return True if the count of divisors is even, and False otherwise.

The unit test provided is `assert count_divisors(10)`, which suggests that the function should return True for the number 10, since 10 has 4 divisors (1, 2, 5, 10) and 4 is an even number.

The solution uses a simple loop to count the number of divisors of the given number. For each number from 1 to the given number, it checks if the given number is divisible by that number. If it is, it increments the count. Finally, it returns whether the count is even or not.

In the code, `count_divisors(10)` returns True, as expected. For example, the number 10 has 4 divisors (1, 2, 5, 10), which is an even number. Therefore, the function correctly returns True for the number 10.
