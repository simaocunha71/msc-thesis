```
def count_divisors(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1
    return count % 2 == 0
``` 

Explanation: 
This function counts the number of divisors for a given number `n`. It then checks if the count is even by using the modulus operator `%`. If the remainder when divided by 2 is 0, the count is even; otherwise, it's odd. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the count of divisors is even. 

The unit test `assert count_divisors(10)` checks if the function correctly identifies the number of divisors for 10, which is 4 (1, 2, 5, 10), and returns `True` since 4 is even. 

Note: This function has a time complexity of O(n), as it iterates over all numbers up to `n`. For large values of `n`, this function may be slow. A more efficient approach would be to use the prime factorization of `n` to count its divisors, but this would require additional logic and is not necessary for small values of `n`. 

Also, the function does not handle the case where `n` is less than 1. Depending on the requirements, you might want to add error handling or modify the function to handle such cases.
