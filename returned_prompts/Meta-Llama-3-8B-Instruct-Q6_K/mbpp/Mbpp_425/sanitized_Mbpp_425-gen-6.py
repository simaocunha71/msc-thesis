def count_element_in_list(lists, target):
  return sum(1 for lst in lists if target in lst)  # Count the number of lists that contain the target element. 
  # The sum function is used with a generator expression to count the number of True values. 
  # The expression 1 for lst in lists if target in lst generates 1 for each list that contains the target element and 0 for each list that does not. 
  # The sum function then adds these 1s and 0s to give the total count. 
  # This approach is more efficient than converting the lists to sets and using the set difference operation, as it avoids creating unnecessary sets. 
  # It also avoids the need to iterate over the lists multiple times, as it does everything in a single iteration over the lists. 
  # The time complexity of this approach is therefore O(n), where n is the total number of elements in the lists. 
  # This is because the sum function iterates over the lists once, and the expression 1 for lst in lists if target in lst iterates over the elements in the lists. 
  # The space complexity is O(1), because the sum function only requires a constant amount of space to store the sum. 
  # This is more efficient than the set difference approach, which requires O(n) space to store the sets. 
  # It is also more efficient than the list comprehension approach, which requires O(n) space to store the list of lists. 
  # This is because the set difference approach requires O(n) space to store the sets, and the list comprehension approach requires O(n) space to store the list of lists.
