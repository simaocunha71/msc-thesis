```
def count_element_in_list(list_of_lists, element):
    count = 0
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        if element in sublist:
            count += 1
    return count
```
The problem is asking to create a function that counts the number of sublists in a given list of lists that contain a specific element.

The provided unit test `assert count_element_in_list([[1, 3], [5, 7], [1, 11], [1, 15, 7]],1)==3` helps to understand the problem better. It shows that the function should count the number of sublists containing the element 1 in the given list of lists.

Here's a Python solution for the problem:

The function `count_element_in_list` iterates over each sublist in the list of lists. For each sublist, it checks if the given element is present in the sublist. If it is, it increments a counter. Finally, it returns the count.

This function is case-sensitive and will treat different types of elements as distinct (e.g., it will count separate occurrences of integers and strings as different elements). If you want to ignore the type or case, you would need to modify the function accordingly. For example, to ignore case, you could convert both the element and the sublist to lowercase before comparing. To ignore type, you could convert the element and the sublist to a common type (e.g., strings) before comparing.
