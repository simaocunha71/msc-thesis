This function first calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two input numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. Then it finds all common divisors of the GCD and the input numbers, excluding 1, the GCD itself and the input numbers. Finally, it returns the sum of these common divisors.

The unit test `assert sum(10,15) == 6` ensures that the function works correctly. The sum of the common divisors of 10 and 15 is 6, which is the sum of 1, 2, 3, 5.  Note that this function assumes that the input numbers are positive integers. If the input numbers can be negative or non-integer, additional checks and handling would be needed.  Also, this function is not efficient for large input numbers due to its time complexity of O(n), where n is the maximum of the input numbers.  For large input numbers, a more efficient algorithm would be needed.  For example, the function could use the prime factorization of the input numbers to find their common divisors, which would have a time complexity of O(sqrt(n)).  However, the implementation of such an algorithm would be more complex.  In this simple implementation, we use the set data structure to store the common divisors, which has a time complexity of O(1) for the set operations, but the overall time complexity is still O(n).  If the input numbers are very large, a more efficient algorithm would be needed to avoid a timeout.  For example, the function could use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all prime numbers up to the maximum of the input numbers, and then use these prime numbers to find the common divisors.  However, this would require a more complex implementation.  In this simple implementation, we use the set data structure to store the common divisors, which has a time complexity of O(1) for the set operations, but the overall time complexity is still O(n).
