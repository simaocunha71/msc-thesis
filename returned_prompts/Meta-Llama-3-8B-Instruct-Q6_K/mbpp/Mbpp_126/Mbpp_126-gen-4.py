This function takes two numbers as input, calculates the set of common divisors for each number, and then returns the sum of the common divisors. The set operations (&) are used to find the common divisors. The function also ensures that the range of numbers to check for divisors is up to the minimum of the two input numbers. This is to avoid unnecessary calculations. The unit test `assert sum(10,15) == 6` ensures that the function works correctly.
