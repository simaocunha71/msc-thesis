```
def sample_nam(names):
    return sum(len(name) for name in names if name[0].isupper())
```


The problem is asking to write a function that takes a list of names as input and returns the sum of the lengths of the names that start with an uppercase letter. 

The function should iterate over the list of names, check if the name starts with an uppercase letter, and if it does, add the length of the name to the total sum.

The unit test `assert sample_nam(['sally', 'Dylan', 'rebecca', 'Diana', 'Joanne', 'keith'])==16` helps to clarify the problem by providing an example of the expected output.

Here's the solution:
```
def sample_nam(names):
    return sum(len(name) for name in names if name[0].isupper())
```
This function uses a generator expression to iterate over the list of names, and the `isupper()` method to check if the first character of each name is uppercase. If it is, the length of the name is added to the total sum. The `sum()` function is then used to calculate the total sum.
