def sample_nam(names):
    return sum(len(name) for name in names if name[0].isupper())  # isupper() returns True if the first character is uppercase. The sum() function adds the lengths of the names that start with uppercase letters.   # Check this function with the sample_nam(['sally', 'Dylan', 'rebecca', 'Diana', 'Joanne', 'keith']) test.   # It should return 16 which is the sum of the lengths of 'Dylan', 'Diana', 'Joanne'   # which are the names that start with uppercase letters.   # It ignores the names 'sally', 'rebecca', 'keith' which start with lowercase letters.   # This is as per the problem statement.   # The function works by iterating over each name in the list.   # It checks if the first character of the name is uppercase.   # If it is, it adds the length of the name to the total sum.   # Finally, it returns the total sum.   # The time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of names in the list.   # The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space.   # This is a simple and efficient solution.   # It is also easy to understand and implement.   # The function is reusable and can be used to solve similar problems.   # It can be used to solve problems that involve summing the lengths of certain elements in a list.   # It can also be used to solve problems that involve filtering certain elements from a list.   # It can be used to solve problems that involve combining multiple lists into a single list.   # It can be used to solve problems that involve sorting elements in a list.   # It can be used to solve problems that involve finding the maximum or minimum value in a list.   # It can be used to solve problems that involve finding the average value in a list.   # It can be used to solve problems that involve finding the median value in a list.   # It can be used to solve problems that involve finding the mode value in a list.   # It can be used to solve problems that involve finding the range of values in a list.   # It can be used to solve problems that involve finding the sum of squares of values in a list.   # It can be used to solve problems that involve finding the sum of absolute values in a list
