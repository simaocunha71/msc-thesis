```
def sample_nam(names):
    return sum(len(name) for name in names if name[0].isupper())
```
The problem is asking to create a function that takes a list of names as input, removes the names that start with a lowercase letter, and returns the sum of the lengths of the remaining names.

The unit test provided is `assert sample_nam(['sally', 'Dylan', 'rebecca', 'Diana', 'Joanne', 'keith'])==16`, which helps to understand the problem better.

The solution uses a generator expression to iterate over the names, checks if the first character of each name is uppercase using the `isupper` method, and sums up the lengths of the names that meet this condition.

Here's the explanation of the code:
- `names` is the list of names passed as an argument to the function.
- `name[0].isupper()` checks if the first character of each name is uppercase. If it is, the name is included in the sum.
- `len(name)` calculates the length of each name.
- `sum(...)` adds up the lengths of the names that meet the condition.
- The result is returned as the output of the function.
