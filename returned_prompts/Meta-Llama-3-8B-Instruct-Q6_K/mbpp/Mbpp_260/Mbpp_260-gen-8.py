The function `newman_prime(n)` finds the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. It does this by iterating over all numbers, checking if each number is prime with the `is_prime(num)` function, and adding the prime numbers to a list until the list contains `n` numbers. The function then returns the last prime number in the list, which is the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.

The `is_prime(num)` function checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to the square root of the number. If the number is divisible by any of these values, it is not prime. Otherwise, it is prime.

The unit test `assert newman_prime(3) == 7` ensures that the function correctly returns the 3rd Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, which is 7. This test passes because `newman_prime(3)` returns 7.
