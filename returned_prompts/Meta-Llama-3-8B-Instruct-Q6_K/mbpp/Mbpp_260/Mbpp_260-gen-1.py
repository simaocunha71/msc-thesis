The Newman-Shanks-Williams (NSW) prime number is a prime number that can be expressed in the form n^3 + ak, where n and k are integers, a is an integer and k is even. We can use this definition to find the nth NSW prime number.

Here is a Python function that finds the nth NSW prime number:

```
def newman_prime(n):
    def is_nsw_prime(num):
        for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
            if num % i == 0:
                return False
        return True

    count = 0
    num = 2
    while True:
        if is_nsw_prime(num):
            if count == n:
                return num
            count += 1
        num += 1
```

This function uses a helper function `is_nsw_prime` to check if a number is an NSW prime number. It then iterates over all numbers starting from 2, checks if each number is an NSW prime number, and returns the nth one. The `is_nsw_prime` function checks if a number is prime by iterating over all numbers up to the square root of the number and checking if the number is divisible by any of them.

The unit test `assert newman_prime(3) == 7` ensures that the function returns the correct result for the third NSW prime number, which is 7. This test can be used to verify that the function is working correctly.
