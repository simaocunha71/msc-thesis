The function `newman_prime` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the `n`th Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. It does this by iterating over all numbers and checking if they are prime using the `is_prime` function. The `is_prime` function checks if a number is prime by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number and checking if the number is divisible by any of the numbers in that range. If the number is not divisible, it is prime. If the number is divisible, it is not prime. The `newman_prime` function returns the first `n`th prime number it finds. This is done by incrementing a count each time it finds a prime number and returning the number when the count reaches `n`. The function starts by initializing the count to 0 and the number to 2, then enters a loop where it increments the number and checks if it is prime. If it is, it increments the count and checks if the count is equal to `n`. If the count is equal to `n`, it returns the number. Otherwise, it continues to the next iteration. This continues until it finds the `n`th prime number, at which point it returns that number. The function is tested with the assertion `assert newman_prime(3) == 7`, which checks that the function returns the third prime number, which is 7. The function works correctly and passes the test.
