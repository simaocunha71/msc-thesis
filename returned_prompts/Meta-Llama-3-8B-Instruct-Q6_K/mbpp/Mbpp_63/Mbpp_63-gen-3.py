```
def max_difference(tuples):
    return max(b - a for a, b in tuples) - min(a for a, _ in tuples)
```





The problem is asking to find the maximum difference between the available pairs in a given tuple list. Each tuple in the list contains two numbers, and the function should return the maximum difference between these numbers.

The unit test provided, `assert max_difference([(3, 5), (1, 7), (10, 3), (1, 2)]) == 7`, helps to understand the problem better. It shows that the function should return 7, which is the maximum difference between the pairs (1, 7) and (3, 5) in the list.

Here's a Python solution for the problem:

```
def max_difference(tuples):
    return max(b - a for a, b in tuples) - min(a for a, _ in tuples)
```

This function uses a generator expression to find the maximum difference between the pairs in the list. It does this by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value. The `max` function is used to find the maximum value, and the `min` function is used to find the minimum value. The `_` variable is used to ignore the second value in each tuple when finding the minimum value.
