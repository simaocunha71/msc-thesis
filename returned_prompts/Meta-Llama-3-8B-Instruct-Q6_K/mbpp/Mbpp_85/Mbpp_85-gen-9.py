```
import math

def surfacearea_sphere(radius):
    return 4 * math.pi * radius**2
```


The problem is to write a function that calculates the surface area of a sphere given its radius. The surface area of a sphere is calculated using the formula 4 * Ï€ * r^2, where r is the radius of the sphere.

The unit test provided ensures that the function works correctly. It checks if the surface area of a sphere with a radius of 10 is approximately equal to 1256.6370614359173.

Here's a simple Python function that implements this formula:

```
import math

def surfacearea_sphere(radius):
    return 4 * math.pi * radius**2
```

This function takes a radius as input, calculates the surface area using the formula, and returns the result. The math.pi constant is used to get the value of pi. The ** operator is used to raise the radius to the power of 2. The result is then returned by the function.
