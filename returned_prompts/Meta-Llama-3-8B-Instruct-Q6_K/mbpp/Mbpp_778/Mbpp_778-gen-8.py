This function iterates over the list, counting the consecutive duplicates of each element. It appends the count of duplicates as a list to the result list. The test case provided in the problem description is:
```
assert pack_consecutive_duplicates([0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4, 4]) == [[0, 0], [1], [2], [3], [4, 4], [5], [6, 6, 6], [7], [8], [9], [4, 4]]
```
