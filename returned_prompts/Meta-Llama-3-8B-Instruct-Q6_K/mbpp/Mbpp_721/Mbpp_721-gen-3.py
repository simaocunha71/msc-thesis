Test:
```
assert maxAverageOfPath([[1, 2, 3], [6, 5, 4], [7, 3, 9]]) == 5.2

Explanation: 
This problem can be solved by using dynamic programming. First, we create a 2D array `dp` of size N*N to store the maximum cost of reaching each cell. Then, we fill the `dp` array by iterating over the matrix. For each cell, we add the cost of the current cell to the maximum cost of the cell above it or to its left. Finally, we find the maximum cost in the `dp` array and divide it by the total number of cells (N*N) to get the maximum average. The result is rounded to 1 decimal place. 

The unit test `assert maxAverageOfPath([[1, 2, 3], [6, 5, 4], [7, 3, 9]]) == 5.2` ensures that the function returns the correct result. 

The time complexity of this solution is O(N^2) and the space complexity is also O(N^2), where N is the size of the matrix. 





Note: 
The dynamic programming approach is used to solve this problem. The idea is to build up the solution for smaller subproblems and then use those solutions to solve the original problem. The dp[i][j] stores the maximum cost of reaching the cell at position (i, j). The maximum cost of reaching the cell at position (i, j) is the maximum of the cost of reaching the cell above it (
