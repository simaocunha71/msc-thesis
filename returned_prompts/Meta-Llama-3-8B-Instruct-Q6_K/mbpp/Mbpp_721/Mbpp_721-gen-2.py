The problem is to find the maximum average cost of a path from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell in a given square matrix. The path can only move right or down. The average cost is calculated as the total cost divided by the number of cells visited in the path.

The given unit test `assert maxAverageOfPath([[1, 2, 3], [6, 5, 4], [7, 3, 9]]) == 5.2` suggests that the problem is to find the maximum average cost of a path from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell in the given matrix, where each cell contains a specific cost.

The solution to this problem is to use dynamic programming to find the maximum sum of the path, and then divide it by the total number of cells visited in the path to get the maximum average cost.

Here is the Python code for the solution:
```
def maxAverageOfPath(matrix):
    N = len(matrix)
    dp = [[0.0] * N for _ in range(N)]
    dp[0][0] = matrix[0][0]
    for i in range(1, N):
        dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + matrix[i][0]
    for j in range(1, N):
        dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] + matrix[0][j]
    for i in range(1, N):
        for j in range(
