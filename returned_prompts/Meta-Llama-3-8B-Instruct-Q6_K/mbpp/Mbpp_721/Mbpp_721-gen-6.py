The problem is asking us to find a path with the maximum average cost, where a path is defined as a sequence of cells that starts from the top-left cell and moves only right or down to the bottom-right cell. We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem.

We first initialize a 2D array `memo` to store the total cost of each cell. We then fill up the `memo` array by iterating over each cell. For each cell, we add the cost of the current cell to the maximum of the cost of the cell above it and the cell to its left.

We then find the maximum total cost by tracing back from the bottom-right cell to the top-left cell. For each cell, we subtract the cost of the cell above it and the cell to its left to get the total cost of the path that starts from the top-left cell and ends at the current cell.

Finally, we divide the total cost by the length of the path to get the average cost of the path. We keep track of the maximum average cost seen so far and return it as the result.

In the given unit test, `maxAverageOfPath([[1, 2, 3], [6, 5, 4], [7, 3, 9]])` should return `5.2`. This is because the path with the maximum average cost is the path that goes from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell, which has a total cost of `1 + 2 + 3
