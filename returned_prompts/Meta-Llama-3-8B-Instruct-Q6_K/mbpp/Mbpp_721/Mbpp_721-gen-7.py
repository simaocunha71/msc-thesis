Note: This code assumes that the input matrix is a square matrix, i.e., the number of rows is equal to the number of columns. It also assumes that the path starts from the top-left cell and ends at the bottom-right cell. The function `maxAverageOfPath` returns the maximum average of all paths in the matrix. The average is calculated as the total cost of the path divided by the number of cells visited in the path. The function uses dynamic programming to compute the maximum average of all paths. It initializes a 2D array `dp` of size N*N, where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum average of all paths that end at cell `(i, j)`. The function then fills up the `dp` array by iterating over the cells in the matrix, and finally returns the maximum value in the `dp` array, which represents the maximum average of all paths in the matrix. The function uses the `max` function to compute the maximum average, and the `/` operator to compute the division of the total cost by the number of cells visited in the path. The function also uses the `range` function to iterate over the cells in the matrix. The function assumes that the input matrix is a list of lists, where each cell is associated with a specific cost. The function does not check if the input matrix is a square matrix, or if the path starts from the top-left cell and ends at the bottom-right cell. The function also does not check if the input matrix is valid, i.e., if it contains only non-negative integers. The function assumes that the input matrix is a valid input. The function does not handle any exceptions, and it does not return any error messages if the input matrix is invalid. The function is designed to be efficient and scalable, and it can handle large input matrices. The
