```
def remove_length(s, k):
    words = s.split()
    return ' '.join([word for word in words if len(word) != k])
```


The function `remove_length` takes a string `s` and an integer `k` as inputs. It first splits the string into a list of words using the `split` method. Then, it uses a list comprehension to create a new list that includes only the words that have a length different from `k`. Finally, it joins the words in the new list with spaces in between using the `join` method and returns the resulting string.

The unit test `assert remove_length('The person is most value tet', 3) == 'person is most value'` ensures that the function works correctly. It checks that the function removes all the words with a length of 3 from the input string and returns the resulting string.
