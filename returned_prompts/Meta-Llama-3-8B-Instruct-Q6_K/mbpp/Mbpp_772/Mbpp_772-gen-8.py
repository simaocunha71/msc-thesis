```
def remove_length(s, k):
    words = s.split()
    return ' '.join([word for word in words if len(word) != k])
```



The provided unit test suggests that the function should remove all words with a length of k from the given string. This can be achieved by splitting the string into words, filtering out the words with length k, and then joining the remaining words back together with spaces.

Here's a Python function that implements this:

```python
def remove_length(s, k):
    words = s.split()
    return ' '.join([word for word in words if len(word) != k])
```

In this function, `s` is the input string and `k` is the length of the words to be removed. The `split` method is used to split the string into words, and then a list comprehension is used to filter out the words with length `k`. The remaining words are then joined back together with spaces using the `join` method. The resulting string is returned by the function.
