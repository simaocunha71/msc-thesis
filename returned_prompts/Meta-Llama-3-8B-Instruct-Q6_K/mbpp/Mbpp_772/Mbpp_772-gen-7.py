```
def remove_length(s, k):
    words = s.split()
    result = ' '.join([word for word in words if len(word) != k])
    return result
```



This function works by first splitting the input string into a list of words using the `split` method. Then, it uses a list comprehension to create a new list that includes only the words whose length is not equal to `k`. Finally, it uses the `join` method to concatenate the words in the new list into a single string, with spaces in between. The result is returned as the output of the function.

The unit test `assert remove_length('The person is most value tet', 3) == 'person is most value'` helps to clarify the expected behavior of the function. It shows that the function should remove all words with length 3 from the input string, resulting in the output `'person is most value'`. This test can be used to verify that the function is working correctly.
