```
def merge_dictionaries_three(dict1, dict2, dict3):
    merged_dict = {**dict1, **dict2, **dict3}
    return merged_dict
```



The function `merge_dictionaries_three` takes three dictionaries as input and returns a new dictionary that is the result of merging the three input dictionaries. The `**` operator is used to unpack the dictionaries and merge them into a new dictionary. If there are any duplicate keys in the input dictionaries, the values from the latter dictionaries will override the values from the former dictionaries. In this case, the values from `dict2` and `dict3` will override the values from `dict1`.

The provided unit test `assert merge_dictionaries_three({ "R": "Red", "B": "Black", "P": "Pink" }, { "G": "Green", "W": "White" },{ "O": "Orange", "W": "White", "B": "Black" })=={'B': 'Black', 'R': 'Red', 'P': 'Pink', 'G': 'Green', 'W': 'White', 'O': 'Orange'}` demonstrates the expected behavior of the function. It shows that the function correctly merges the three input dictionaries and returns the resulting dictionary.
