    for key in dict1:
        if key not in merged_dict:
            merged_dict[key] = dict1[key]
    for key in dict2:
        if key not in merged_dict:
            merged_dict[key] = dict2[key]

```
The problem is asking to merge three dictionaries into a single dictionary. The function should take three dictionaries as input and return a new dictionary that contains all the key-value pairs from the three input dictionaries. If a key exists in multiple dictionaries, the value from the last dictionary should be used.

Here is a Python solution for the problem:
```
def merge_dictionaries_three(dict1, dict2, dict3):
    merged_dict = {}
    for key in dict1:
        if key not in merged_dict:
            merged_dict[key] = dict1[key]
    for key in dict2:
        if key not in merged_dict:
            merged_dict[key] = dict2[key]
    for key in dict3:
        if key not in merged_dict:
            merged_dict[key] = dict3[key]
    return merged_dict
```
This function iterates over the keys of the three input dictionaries and adds the key-value pairs to the `merged_dict` dictionary. If a key already exists in the `merged_dict`, the value from the last dictionary is used. The function returns the `merged_dict` dictionary.

The unit test `assert merge_dictionaries_three({ "R": "Red", "B": "Black", "P": "Pink" }, { "G": "Green", "W": "White" },{ "O": "Orange", "W": "White", "B": "Black" })=={'B': 'Black', 'R': 'Red', 'P': 'Pink', 'G': 'Green', 'W': 'White', 'O': 'Orange'}` ensures that the function works correctly. It checks that the function merges the three input dictionaries into a single dictionary and returns the expected output.
