def merge_dictionaries_three(dict1, dict2, dict3):

    return merged_dict
```


The function `merge_dictionaries_three` takes three dictionaries as input and returns a new dictionary that is the result of merging the three input dictionaries. The function uses the `copy` method to create a copy of the first dictionary, and then uses the `update` method to add the key-value pairs from the second and third dictionaries to the copy. The resulting dictionary is then returned.

For example, if we call `merge_dictionaries_three({ "R": "Red", "B": "Black", "P": "Pink" }, { "G": "Green", "W": "White" },{ "O": "Orange", "W": "White", "B": "Black" })`, the function will return `{'B': 'Black', 'R': 'Red', 'P': 'Pink', 'G': 'Green', 'W': 'White', 'O': 'Orange'}`. This is because the resulting dictionary contains all the key-value pairs from the three input dictionaries, with no conflicts (since the keys in the three dictionaries do not overlap). If there were conflicts (i.e., the same key appeared in multiple dictionaries with different values), the value from the last dictionary to be updated would take precedence. For example, if the dictionaries were `{ "R": "Red", "B": "Black", "P": "Pink" }, { "B": "Blue" },{ "B": "Black" }`, the resulting dictionary would be `{'R': 'Red', 'B': 'Black', 'P': 'Pink'}`. This is because the value for the key "B" in the third dictionary takes precedence over the value in the second dictionary.
