def merge_dictionaries_three(dict1, dict2, dict3):
    return {**dict1, **dict2, **dict3}
```





The problem is asking to create a function that takes three dictionaries as input and returns a new dictionary that is the combination of the three input dictionaries. 

The unit test provided helps to clarify the expected behavior of the function. It shows that the function should merge the three dictionaries and return a new dictionary with all the key-value pairs from the input dictionaries.

The solution to this problem is to use the dictionary unpacking syntax ({**dict1, **dict2, **dict3}) to merge the dictionaries. This syntax creates a new dictionary that contains all the key-value pairs from the input dictionaries.

Here is the solution:
```
def merge_dictionaries_three(dict1, dict2, dict3):
    return {**dict1, **dict2, **dict3}
```
This function takes three dictionaries as input, and returns a new dictionary that is the combination of the three input dictionaries. The dictionary unpacking syntax ({**dict1, **dict2, **dict3}) is used to merge the dictionaries. This syntax creates a new dictionary that contains all the key-value pairs from the input dictionaries.
