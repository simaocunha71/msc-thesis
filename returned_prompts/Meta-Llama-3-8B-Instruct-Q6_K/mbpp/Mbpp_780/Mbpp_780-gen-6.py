```
def find_combinations(tuple_list):
    combinations = set()
    for i in range(len(tuple_list)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(tuple_list)):
            combinations.add(tuple(sorted([tuple_list[i][0] + tuple_list[j][0], tuple_list[i][1] + tuple_list[j][1]])))
    return list(combinations)
```


This function works by iterating over the list of tuples and for each pair of tuples, it calculates the sums of their elements and adds them to the set of combinations. The `sorted` function is used to ensure that the combinations are added in a consistent order, so that duplicates are not added to the set. The `set` is then converted to a list before being returned. 

The unit test provided, `assert find_combinations([(2, 4), (6, 7), (5, 1), (6, 10)]) == [(8, 11), (7, 5), (8, 14), (11, 8), (12, 17), (11, 11)]`, shows that the function should find all combinations of sums of elements from the input tuples. The combinations are not required to be unique, so the function returns all possible combinations. 





Note: The problem statement is unclear, so I will assume that the question is asking for all combinations of sums of elements from the input tuples. If the question is asking for unique combinations, the function should be modified to remove duplicates.
