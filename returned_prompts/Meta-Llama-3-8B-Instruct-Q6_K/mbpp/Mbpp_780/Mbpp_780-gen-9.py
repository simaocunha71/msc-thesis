def find_combinations(tuples):
    result = set()
    for i in range(len(tuples)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(tuples)):
            result.add((tuples[i][0]+tuples[j][0], tuples[i][1]+tuples[j][1]))
            result.add((tuples[i][0]+tuples[j][1], tuples[i][1]+tuples[j][0]))
    return list(result)

The problem is asking to find all possible combinations of sums with tuples in the given tuple list. The function should return a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the sum of two corresponding elements from the input tuples.

The unit test `assert find_combinations([(2, 4), (6, 7), (5, 1), (6, 10)]) == [(8, 11), (7, 5), (8, 14), (11, 8), (12, 17), (11, 11)]` helps to clarify the problem. It shows that the function should return a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the sum of two corresponding elements from the input tuples.

The solution uses two nested loops to iterate over the input tuples. For each pair of tuples, it calculates the sums of corresponding elements and adds them to the result set. The result set is then converted to a list and returned.

The time complexity of the solution is O(n^2), where n is the number of input tuples. This is because the function uses two nested loops to iterate over the input tuples. The space complexity is O(n), as the function stores the result in a set and then converts it to a list.
