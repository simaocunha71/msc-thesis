def find_combinations(tuples_list):
    combinations = []
    for i in range(len(tuples_list)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(tuples_list)):
            combinations.append((tuples_list[i][0] + tuples_list[j][0], tuples_list[i][1] + tuples_list[j][1]))
    return combinations
```
The function `find_combinations` takes a list of tuples as an input and returns a list of tuples representing the combinations of sums. It iterates over the list using two nested loops and for each pair of tuples, it calculates the sums and appends the result to the `combinations` list. The time complexity is O(n^2) where n is the length of the input list. 

The unit test `assert find_combinations([(2, 4), (6, 7), (5, 1), (6, 10)]) == [(8, 11), (7, 5), (8, 14), (11, 8), (12, 17), (11, 11)]` ensures that the function works correctly. 

This problem is an example of the combination problem, which is a classic problem in computer science. It is a variation of the two-pointer technique, where we use two pointers to traverse the list and calculate the combinations. The time complexity is O(n^2) because we are using two nested loops to iterate over the list. The space complexity is O(n) because we are storing the combinations in a list. 

The function can be optimized by using a set to store the combinations and then converting it to a list. This would reduce the space complexity to O(n) and the time complexity would remain the same. However, the original implementation is more readable and easier to understand. 

The function can also be implemented using the `itertools` module, which provides functions for working with iterators. Specifically, we can use the `combinations` function to generate all possible combinations of the input list. This would be a more efficient solution, but it would also be more complex and harder to understand. 

Here is the optimized implementation using a set:
```
def find_combinations(tuples_list):
    combinations = set()
    for i in range(len(tuples_list)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(tuples_list)):
            combinations.add((tuples_list[i][0] + tuples_list[j][0], tuples_list[i][1] + tuples_list
