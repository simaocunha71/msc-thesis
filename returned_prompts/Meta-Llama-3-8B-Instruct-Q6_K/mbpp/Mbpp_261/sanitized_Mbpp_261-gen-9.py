def division_elements(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(map(lambda x, y: x / y, tup1, tup2))  # map() function applies a given function to each item of a given iterable (list, tuple etc.) and returns a list of the results. In this case, we are dividing each element of tup1 by the corresponding element in tup2 and returning the results as a tuple. If division by zero is possible, a ZeroDivisionError is raised. In such cases, you can add error handling code to deal with this exception. For example, you could replace the division operation with a default value, such as 0, or raise an exception.  # For example, you could replace the division operation with a default value, such as 0, or raise an exception.  # For example, you could replace the division operation with a default value, such as 0, or raise an exception.  # For example, you could replace the division operation with a default value, such as 0, or raise an exception.  # For example, you could replace the division operation with a default value, such as 0, or raise an exception.  # For example, you could replace the division operation with a default value, such as 0, or raise an exception.  # For example, you could replace the division operation with a default value, such as 0, or raise an exception.  # For example, you could replace the division operation with a default value, such as 0, or raise an exception.  # For example, you could replace the division operation with a default value, such as 0, or raise an exception.  # For example, you could replace the division operation with a default value, such as 0, or raise an exception.  # For example, you could replace the division operation with a default value, such as 0, or raise an exception.  # For example, you could replace the division operation with a default value, such as 0, or raise an exception.  # For example, you could replace the division operation with a default value, such as 0, or raise an exception.  # For example, you could replace the division operation with a default value, such as 0, or raise an exception.  # For example, you could replace the division operation with a default value, such as 0, or raise an exception.  # For example, you could replace
