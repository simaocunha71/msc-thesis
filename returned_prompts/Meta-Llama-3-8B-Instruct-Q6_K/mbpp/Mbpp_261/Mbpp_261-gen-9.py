```
def division_elements(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple(i / j for i, j in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
```
The function `division_elements` takes two tuples, `tuple1` and `tuple2`, as input. It uses the built-in Python functions `zip` and `tuple` to iterate over the elements of the two tuples in parallel. For each pair of elements, it performs a division operation and returns a new tuple containing the results of the divisions. The function uses a generator expression to perform the divisions and create the resulting tuple.

The provided unit test `assert division_elements((10, 4, 6, 9),(5, 2, 3, 3)) == (2, 2, 2, 3)` ensures that the function works correctly for the given input. It checks that the output of the function is equal to the expected result `(2, 2, 2, 3)` when the input is `(10, 4, 6, 9)` and `(5, 2, 3, 3)`. If the function is implemented correctly, this test should pass.
