```
def division_elements(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple(i / j for i, j in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
```
This function uses the built-in `zip` function to iterate over the elements of the two tuples in parallel. It then performs the division operation on each pair of elements and returns the results as a new tuple. The `assert` statement provided ensures that the function behaves correctly for the given input. For example, when `tuple1 = (10, 4, 6, 9)` and `tuple2 = (5, 2, 3, 3)`, the function should return `(2, 2, 2, 3)`.
