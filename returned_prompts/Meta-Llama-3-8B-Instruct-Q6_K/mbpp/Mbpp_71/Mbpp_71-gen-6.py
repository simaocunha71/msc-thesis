This code implements the Comb Sort algorithm, which is a hybrid sorting algorithm, derived from the Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort algorithms. The goal is to eliminate the large gaps in the list by repeatedly shrinking the gap until it reaches 1. Then it uses Insertion Sort to sort the remaining list. 

The unit test provided checks if the function correctly sorts the list of integers. The expected output is the same as the input, which means the list is already sorted.
