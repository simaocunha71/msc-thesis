This solution implements the Comb Sort algorithm, which is a variation of the Bubble Sort algorithm. It is designed to minimize the number of comparisons and swaps required to sort a list of elements.

The function takes a list of elements as input and returns the sorted list. It uses two main variables: `gap` and `swapped`. `gap` is initialized to the length of the list, and `swapped` is set to `True` initially.

The algorithm iterates through the list, and for each iteration, it checks if the current `gap` is greater than 1. If it is, it divides the `gap` by 1.3 and sets `swapped` to `False`. This process is repeated until `gap` is less than or equal to 1.

Within each iteration, the algorithm checks if the current element is greater than the next `gap` elements. If it is, it swaps the elements. If any swaps are made during an iteration, `swapped` is set to `True`.

The function returns the sorted list once the `gap` is less than or equal to 1 and no more swaps are made.

The unit test `assert comb_sort([5, 15, 37, 25, 79]) == [5, 15, 25, 37, 79]` ensures that the function sorts the list correctly.
