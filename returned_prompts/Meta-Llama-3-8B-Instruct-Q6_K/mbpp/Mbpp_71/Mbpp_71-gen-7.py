This problem requires you to implement a comb sort algorithm, which is a hybrid sorting algorithm that combines elements of bubble sort and insertion sort. The function takes a list of elements as input and returns the sorted list.

The provided unit test `assert comb_sort([5, 15, 37, 25, 79]) == [5, 15, 25, 37, 79]` helps to clarify the expected output of the function.

The solution uses a helper function `gap_insertion_sort` to perform the insertion sort with a specified gap size. The main function iteratively reduces the gap size until it reaches 1, and then performs the insertion sort with the current gap size until the list is sorted.

The `comb_sort` function returns the sorted list. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input list. However, it is generally faster than bubble sort for most lists and can be more efficient than insertion sort for lists with a large number of elements.
