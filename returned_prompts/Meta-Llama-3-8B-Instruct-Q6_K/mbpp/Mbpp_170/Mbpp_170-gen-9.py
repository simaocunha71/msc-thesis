```
def sum_range_list(lst, start, end):
    return sum(lst[start:end+1])
```
The task is to create a function that calculates the sum of numbers in a list within a specified range defined by two indices. The function should take three parameters: the list of numbers, the start index, and the end index. It should then return the sum of the numbers within the specified range.

The unit test `assert sum_range_list([2,1,5,6,8,3,4,9,10,11,8,12], 8, 10) == 29` helps to clarify the task. It shows that the function should sum the numbers from the 8th index (0-based indexing) to the 10th index (exclusive) in the list `[2,1,5,6,8,3,4,9,10,11,8,12]`, resulting in a sum of 29.

The solution is a simple function that uses the built-in `sum` function and list slicing. It sums the elements of the list from the start index (inclusive) to the end index (exclusive) and returns the result. The list slicing `lst[start:end+1]` is used to get the elements within the specified range. The `end+1` is used to make the end index exclusive, as in the problem statement.  ```python
def sum_range_list(lst, start, end):
    return sum(lst[start:end+1])
