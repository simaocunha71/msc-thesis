```
def sum_range_list(lst, start, end):
    return sum(lst[start:end+1])
```
The function `sum_range_list` takes a list `lst` and two indices `start` and `end` as input. It returns the sum of the elements in the list within the range specified by `start` and `end`. The index `end` is inclusive, meaning that the element at `end` is included in the sum. The `sum` function is used to calculate the sum of the elements in the specified range. The `start:end+1` slice is used to extract the elements in the range from the list. The `assert` statement in the problem ensures that the function works correctly for the given example. For example, the sum of the elements in the list `[2,1,5,6,8,3,4,9,10,11,8,12]` within the range `8` to `10` is `29`, which is the sum of the elements at indices `8`, `9`, and `10`. 

This function assumes that the indices are valid, i.e., `start` and `end` are within the range of the list indices. If the indices are invalid, the function may raise an error or return incorrect results. In a real-world application, you may want to add error handling to ensure that the indices are valid. 

For example, you could add a check to ensure that `start` and `end` are within the range of the list indices:
```
def sum_range_list(lst, start, end):
    if start < 0 or end >= len(lst):
        raise ValueError("Invalid indices")
    return sum(lst[start:end+1])
```  This version of the function raises a `ValueError` if `start` or `end` is outside the range of the list indices. You could also return a default value or handle the error in a different way depending on your requirements.
