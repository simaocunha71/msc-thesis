```
def sum_range_list(lst, start, end):
    return sum(lst[start:end+1])
```





The problem is asking to write a function that takes a list of numbers and two indices as input, and returns the sum of all numbers in the list within the range specified by the two indices.

For example, if the list is [2,1,5,6,8,3,4,9,10,11,8,12] and the indices are 8 and 10, the function should return 29 because the numbers within the range are 8, 9, 10 and 11, and their sum is 29.

The unit test provided helps to clarify the problem by showing that the function should sum the numbers from the start index to the end index (inclusive). This is demonstrated by the test case sum_range_list([2,1,5,6,8,3,4,9,10,11,8,12], 8, 10) == 29.

Here is the solution to the problem:
```
def sum_range_list(lst, start, end):
    return sum(lst[start:end+1])
```
This function uses the built-in sum function in Python to add up all the numbers in the list from the start index to the end index (inclusive). The end index is incremented by 1 because list indices in Python are 0-based, meaning the last element is at index len(lst)-1. Therefore, we need to add 1 to the end index to include the last element in the sum.
