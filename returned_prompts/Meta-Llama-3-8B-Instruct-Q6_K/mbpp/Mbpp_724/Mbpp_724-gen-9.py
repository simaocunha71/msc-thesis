```
The function `power_base_sum` takes two arguments `base` and `power`. It calculates the sum of all digits of the base to the specified power. It does this by using a for loop to calculate the base to the power for each iteration, then converting this value to a string, and finally summing up all the digits in this string. The function then returns the sum.

The unit test `assert power_base_sum(2,100)==115` checks if the function returns the correct result for the base 2 and power 100. This test ensures that the function is working correctly. 

This function is efficient because it uses a for loop to calculate the base to the power for each iteration, and it uses a generator expression to sum up all the digits in the string. This makes the function scalable and efficient for large inputs.
