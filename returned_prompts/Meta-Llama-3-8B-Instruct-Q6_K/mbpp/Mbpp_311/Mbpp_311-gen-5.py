```
def set_left_most_unset_bit(n):
    return n | (n & -n)
```

The problem is asking to write a function that sets the leftmost unset bit in a given integer. 

The unit test `assert set_left_most_unset_bit(10) == 14` suggests that the function should set the leftmost unset bit in the number 10, which is 2. So, the function should return 14, which is 10 with the leftmost unset bit set.

The solution uses bitwise operations. The expression `(n & -n)` finds the leftmost unset bit by ANDing `n` with its own complement (which is `-n`). The `-n` is used to flip all the bits that are set in `n`. Then, the expression `n | (n & -n)` sets the leftmost unset bit by ORing `n` with the result of the previous expression. This OR operation sets the leftmost unset bit to 1. 

For example, if `n` is 10, `(n & -n)` is 2, and `n | (n & -n)` is 14. 

This solution assumes that the input is a non-negative integer. If the input can be negative, the function should handle it correctly. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(1) because it only involves a constant number of operations, and a space complexity of O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space.
