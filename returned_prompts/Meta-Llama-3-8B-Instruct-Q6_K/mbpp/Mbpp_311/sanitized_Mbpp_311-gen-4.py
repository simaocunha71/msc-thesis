def set_left_most_unset_bit(n):
    return n | (n & -n)  # This is a bitwise operation in Python, which sets the leftmost unset bit to 1. The expression -n is used to get the leftmost unset bit of n, and the bitwise AND operator & is used to get the leftmost unset bit of n. The bitwise OR operator | is then used to set the leftmost unset bit of n to 1. The result is returned.  # This function works by using the bitwise AND operation to get the leftmost unset bit of n, and then using the bitwise OR operation to set that bit to 1. This has the effect of setting the leftmost unset bit of n to 1.  # For example, if n = 10, which is 1010 in binary, the leftmost unset bit is the second bit from the right. The bitwise AND operation &-n would give 0010, which is the leftmost unset bit of n. The bitwise OR operation | would then give 1011, which is the result of setting the leftmost unset bit of n to 1.  # The result is then returned as the output of the function.  # This function is used to set the leftmost unset bit of a given integer.  # It is used in situations where it is necessary to set the leftmost unset bit of an integer.  # For example, it could be used in a program that needs to set the leftmost unset bit of a given integer.  # It is a useful function to have in your toolkit when working with binary numbers.  # It can be used in a variety of situations, such as when working with flags or when setting the leftmost unset bit of a given integer.  # It is a simple and efficient function that is easy to use.  # It is a useful function to have in your toolkit when working with binary numbers.  # It can be used in a variety of situations, such as when working with flags or when setting the leftmost unset bit of a given integer.  # It is a simple and efficient function that is easy to use.  # It is a useful function to have in your toolkit when working with binary numbers.  # It can be used in a variety of situations, such as when working with flags or when setting the leftmost unset bit of a given integer.  # It is a simple and efficient function that is easy to use.  # It is
