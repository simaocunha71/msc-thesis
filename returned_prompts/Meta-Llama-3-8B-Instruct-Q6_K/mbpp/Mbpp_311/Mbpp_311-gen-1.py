The problem is asking to write a function that sets the leftmost unset bit in a given integer.

The provided unit test `assert set_left_most_unset_bit(10) == 14` suggests that the function should set the leftmost unset bit in the given integer.

Here is a Python solution for the problem:

```python
def set_left_most_unset_bit(n):
    # Find the position of the leftmost unset bit
    left_most_unset_bit_position = n.bit_length() - 1 - bin(n).count('1')
    
    # Set the leftmost unset bit
    n |= 1 << left_most_unset_bit_position
    
    return n
```

In this solution, we first find the position of the leftmost unset bit by calculating the number of bits in the binary representation of the integer minus one, and then subtracting the number of ones in the binary representation. We then use the left shift operator (`<<`) to shift the binary representation of 1 to the left by the position of the leftmost unset bit, and use the bitwise OR operator (`|=`) to set the leftmost unset bit. Finally, we return the updated integer.
