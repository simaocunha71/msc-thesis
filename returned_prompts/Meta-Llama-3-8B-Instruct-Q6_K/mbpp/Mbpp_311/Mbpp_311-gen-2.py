    return n | (n & -n)
```
The function `set_left_most_unset_bit` takes an integer `n` as input and returns an integer. It uses bitwise operations to set the left most unset bit in the binary representation of `n`.

The expression `(n & -n)` finds the left most unset bit by performing a bitwise AND operation between `n` and its two's complement. This is because the two's complement of `n` will have all the bits set to the right of the left most unset bit in `n`, and a bitwise AND operation between `n` and its two's complement will result in all the bits set to the right of the left most unset bit in `n` being unset, and the left most unset bit being set.

The expression `n | (n & -n)` performs a bitwise OR operation between `n` and the result of the expression `(n & -n)`. This sets the left most unset bit in `n` to 1. The bitwise OR operation ensures that all the bits set to the right of the left most unset bit in `n` remain unchanged, and the left most unset bit is set to 1.

For example, if `n` is 10, which is 1010 in binary, the function will return 14, which is 1110 in binary. The left most unset bit in 10 is set to 1 in 14. This is because the bitwise AND operation between 10 and its two's complement (1111) results in 0001, which has only the left most unset bit set. The bitwise OR operation between 10 and 0001 sets the left most unset bit in 10 to 1. 14 is the result of this operation. 

The unit test `assert set_left_most_unset_bit(10) == 14` ensures that the function is working correctly for the input 10. It checks that the function returns 14, which is the expected result. 14 is the result of setting the left most unset bit in 10 to 1. 14 is 1110 in binary, which has the left most unset bit set. 10 is 1010 in binary, which does not have the left most unset bit set. The function correctly sets the left most unset bit in 10 to 1 to get 14.
