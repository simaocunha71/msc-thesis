The task is to write a Python function that takes an integer as input and returns the same integer with the leftmost unset bit set to 1.

The unit test `assert set_left_most_unset_bit(10) == 14` suggests that the function should set the leftmost unset bit in the binary representation of the input number to 1. For example, the binary representation of 10 is 1010, and the leftmost unset bit is the second bit from the right. Setting this bit to 1 results in the binary representation 1100, which is 12 in decimal. Since we need to add 2 to get 14, we can write the function as follows:

```
def set_left_most_unset_bit(n):
    n |= n >> 1
    return n + 1
```

In this function, `n` is the input number. The expression `n |= n >> 1` sets the leftmost unset bit in the binary representation of `n` to 1. The `n + 1` at the end is necessary because the function is supposed to return the integer with the leftmost unset bit set to 1, not just the integer with that bit set. For example, if the input is 10, the function should return 14, not 12. The `+ 1` ensures that the function returns the correct result.
