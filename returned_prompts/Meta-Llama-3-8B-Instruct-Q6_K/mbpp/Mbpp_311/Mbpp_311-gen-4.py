```
def set_left_most_unset_bit(n):
    return n | (n & -n)
``` 
This function works by using bitwise operations to find the left most unset bit in the number, and then setting it. The expression `n & -n` finds the left most unset bit by doing a bitwise AND operation with `n` and the negation of `n`. The negation of `n` is a number with all bits set to the opposite of `n`, and the bitwise AND operation will give us the left most unset bit. Then, we use the bitwise OR operation to set this bit by adding `n & -n` to `n`. This will result in the number with the left most unset bit set. 

For example, if we call `set_left_most_unset_bit(10)`, it will return `14`, which is `10` with the left most unset bit set. 

The unit test `assert set_left_most_unset_bit(10) == 14` ensures that this function works correctly. 

This function works for all positive integers, and it assumes that the input is a positive integer. If the input can be zero or a negative integer, you should add error checking code to handle these cases.
