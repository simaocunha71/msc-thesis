```
def set_left_most_unset_bit(n):
    return n | (n & -n)
```
Explanation:
The problem is asking to set the leftmost unset bit in a given number. This can be achieved by using bitwise operations in Python.

The expression `n & -n` will give the leftmost unset bit of `n`. The `-n` expression inverts `n` and then subtracts 1 from it, which results in a number with only one bit set in the leftmost unset position of `n`. The `&` operator then performs a bitwise AND operation between `n` and this number, resulting in a number with only the leftmost unset bit of `n` set.

The expression `n | (n & -n)` then sets the leftmost unset bit of `n` by performing a bitwise OR operation between `n` and the result of `n & -n`. This will set the leftmost unset bit of `n` to 1 and leave all other bits unchanged.

The unit test `assert set_left_most_unset_bit(10) == 14` ensures that the function works correctly. When `n` is 10, the leftmost unset bit is set, resulting in 14.  ```python
