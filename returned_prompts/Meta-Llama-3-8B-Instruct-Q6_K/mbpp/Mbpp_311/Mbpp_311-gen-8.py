def set_left_most_unset_bit(n):
    mask = n & -n
    return n | mask
```
Explanation:
The problem is asking to write a function that sets the left most unset bit of a given number. The function should take an integer as input and return the integer with the left most unset bit set to 1.

The provided unit test `assert set_left_most_unset_bit(10) == 14` suggests that the function should work for a 32-bit integer.

The solution uses a bitwise operation to achieve this. The expression `n & -n` finds the left most unset bit by performing a bitwise AND operation between the number `n` and its two's complement. The two's complement of a number is obtained by flipping all its bits and then adding 1.

The expression `n | mask` sets the left most unset bit to 1 by performing a bitwise OR operation between the number `n` and the mask. The mask is the left most unset bit obtained in the previous step.

For example, if the input is 10 (which is 1010 in binary), the function will return 14 (which is 1110 in binary). The left most unset bit is set to 1 in the output.
