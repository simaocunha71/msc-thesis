def set_left_most_unset_bit(n):
    return n | (n & -n)
```

Explanation:
The problem is asking to set the left most unset bit in a given integer. The left most unset bit is the first bit from the left that is not set (1). 

The solution uses bitwise operators. The expression `n & -n` gives the left most unset bit. The expression `n | (n & -n)` sets the left most unset bit. 

The expression `n & -n` works as follows. The `-n` expression is the two's complement of `n`. The two's complement of a binary number is obtained by inverting all the bits and adding 1. The result is a binary number that represents the same integer as the original number, but with the bits reversed. 

The expression `n & -n` gives the left most unset bit because the left most unset bit is the first bit that is not set in the binary representation of `n`. When the left most unset bit is set, the result of `n & -n` is non-zero. When the left most unset bit is unset, the result of `n & -n` is zero. 

The expression `n | (n & -n)` sets the left most unset bit by performing a bitwise OR operation between `n` and the result of `n & -n`. If the result of `n & -n` is non-zero, the left most unset bit is set. If the result of `n & -n` is zero, the left most unset bit remains unset. 

The unit test `assert set_left_most_unset_bit(10) == 14` shows that the function should return 14 when the input is 10. The binary representation of 10 is 1010. The left most unset bit is the second bit from the left, which is 0. The function should return 1010, which is 14 in decimal.
