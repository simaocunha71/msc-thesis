```
def set_left_most_unset_bit(n):
    return n | (n & -n)
```
The problem is asking to create a function that takes an integer as input and returns the same integer but with the leftmost unset bit set to 1. For example, if the input is 10 (which is 1010 in binary), the output should be 14 (which is 1110 in binary).

The unit test provided is `assert set_left_most_unset_bit(10) == 14`, which helps to understand the problem better.

The solution uses bitwise operations. The expression `n & -n` is used to find the leftmost unset bit. The expression `-n` is used to flip all the bits of `n`, so `n & -n` will be equal to the leftmost unset bit. The expression `n | (n & -n)` is used to set the leftmost unset bit to 1. The `|` operator is used for bitwise OR operation, which sets the leftmost unset bit to 1. The `-n` expression is used to flip all the bits of `n`, so `n & -n` will be equal to the leftmost unset bit.

For example, if the input is 10 (which is 1010 in binary), the expression `n & -n` will be equal to 2 (which is 0010 in binary), which is the leftmost unset bit. The expression `n | (n & -n)` will be equal to 14 (which is 1110 in binary), which is the output. 

This solution works for any positive integer input. If the input is 0, the function will return 0. If the input is a negative integer, the function will return a negative integer. 

The time complexity of this solution is O(1), which means it takes constant time to run. The space complexity is also O(1), which means it uses constant space to run.
