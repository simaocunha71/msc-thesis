```
def find_substring(lst, substr):
    for item in lst:
        if substr in item:
            return True
    return False
```



The problem asks you to create a function that checks if a given substring exists in any of the strings in a list. The function should return True if the substring is found, and False otherwise.

Here's a Python solution for this problem:

```
def find_substring(lst, substr):
    for item in lst:
        if substr in item:
            return True
    return False
```

This function iterates over each string in the list and checks if the substring is present in the string. If the substring is found, the function immediately returns True. If the function finishes checking all strings in the list without finding the substring, it returns False.

The unit test `assert find_substring(["red", "black", "white", "green", "orange"],"ack")==True` ensures that the function works correctly. It checks if the substring "ack" is present in any of the strings in the list. The function should return True because "ack" is present in the string "black". If the function returns False, the test will fail. 





Note: The problem statement is a bit unclear, but based on the unit test provided, it seems that the function should return True if the substring is found in any of the strings in the list, and False otherwise. If the problem is intended to be the opposite (i.e., return True if the substring is not found in any of the strings), the unit test would need to be revised.
