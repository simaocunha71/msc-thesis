```
def find_substring(lst, sub):
    return any(sub in s for s in lst)
```
The function `find_substring` takes two parameters: a list of strings `lst` and a string `sub`. It returns `True` if `sub` is found as a substring in any of the strings in `lst`, and `False` otherwise.

The `any` function is used to check if the condition `sub in s` is `True` for at least one string `s` in the list `lst`. The `in` operator checks if `sub` is a substring of `s`. If `sub` is found in any of the strings in `lst`, `any` returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

For example, `find_substring(["red", "black", "white", "green", "orange"], "ack")` returns `True` because "ack" is a substring of "black". Similarly, `find_substring(["red", "black", "white", "green", "orange"], "xyz")` returns `False` because "xyz" is not a substring of any of the strings in the list.
