Explanation:
The function `find_substring` takes two parameters: a list of strings `lst` and a substring `substring`. It iterates over each string in the list. If the substring is found in any of the strings, the function returns `True`. If the substring is not found in any of the strings, the function returns `False`. 

The unit test `assert find_substring(["red", "black", "white", "green", "orange"],"ack")==True` suggests that the function should return `True` if the substring "ack" is present in any of the strings in the list. The function passes this test because the substring "ack" is present in the string "black". 

This function is case-sensitive and does not handle punctuation or special characters. If you want to make it case-insensitive, you can convert both the string and the substring to lower case or upper case before checking if the substring is present. If you want to handle punctuation or special characters, you can remove them from the string and the substring before checking if the substring is present.
