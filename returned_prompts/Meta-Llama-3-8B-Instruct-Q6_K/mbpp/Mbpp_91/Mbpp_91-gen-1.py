        if substr in s:
            return True
    return False

The function `find_substring` takes two parameters, `lst` which is a list of strings and `substr` which is the substring to be searched. It iterates over each string in the list and checks if the substring is present in the string. If the substring is found in any of the strings, the function returns `True`. If the substring is not found in any of the strings, the function returns `False`. 

The unit test `assert find_substring(["red", "black", "white", "green", "orange"],"ack")==True` ensures that the function works correctly. The substring "ack" is present in the string "black", so the function should return `True`. 

This problem is a variation of the problem of finding a substring in a string, but instead of a single string, it involves searching a substring in a list of strings.  The solution is similar, but instead of iterating over the characters of the string, it iterates over the strings in the list.  The time complexity of this solution is O(n*m), where n is the number of strings in the list and m is the length of the longest string in the list.  The space complexity is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space.  This solution is efficient for large lists of strings, but it may not be suitable for very large strings.  In that case, a more efficient solution using a suffix tree or a similar data structure may be needed.  However, for most practical purposes, this solution should be sufficient.  The unit test `assert find_substring(["red", "black", "white", "green", "orange"],"ack")==True` ensures that the function works correctly.  The substring "ack" is present in the string "black", so the function should return `True`.  The unit test `assert find_substring(["red", "black", "white", "green", "orange"],"blue")==False` ensures that the function returns `False` when the substring is not present in any of the strings.  The substring "blue" is not present in any of the strings, so the function should return `False`.  These unit tests ensure that the function works correctly for both cases.  The function can be tested with different inputs to ensure that it works correctly for all possible cases.
