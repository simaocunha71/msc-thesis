def find_substring(lst, substring):
  return any(substring in s for s in lst)  # This function uses the 'any' function to check if the substring is present in any of the strings in the list. If it is, it returns True, otherwise it returns False.  # The 'in' operator checks if a substring is present in a string.  # The 'any' function returns True if at least one element of the iterable (in this case, the generator expression) is True. If all elements are False, it returns False.  # This function is case-sensitive. If you want to make it case-insensitive, you can convert both the string and the substring to lowercase or uppercase before comparing.  # For example, you can use the 'lower' method to convert the string and the substring to lowercase:  # return any(substring.lower() in s.lower() for s in lst)  # This way, the function will return True if the substring is present in the string, regardless of the case.  # For example, it will return True for the input ["red", "black", "white", "green", "orange"], "ack" even if the substring is not present in the string in the same case.  # For example, it will return True for the input ["red", "black", "white", "green", "orange"], "AcK" even if the substring is not present in the string in the same case.  # You can use the 'upper' method to convert the string and the substring to uppercase instead of lowercase.  # For example, you can use the 'upper' method to convert the string and the substring to uppercase:  # return any(substring.upper() in s.upper() for s in lst)  # This way, the function will return True if the substring is present in the string, regardless of the case.  # For example, it will return True for the input ["red", "black", "white", "green", "orange"], "AcK" even if the substring is not present in the string in the same case.  # You can also use the 'casefold' method to convert the string and the substring to a case-insensitive string.  # For example, you can use the 'casefold' method to convert the string and the substring to a case-insensitive string:  # return any(substring.casefold() in s.casefold() for s in lst)  #
