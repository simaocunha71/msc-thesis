```
import math

def circle_circumference(radius):
    return 2 * math.pi * radius
```


The problem is asking to create a function that calculates the circumference of a circle given its radius. The circumference of a circle is calculated using the formula 2 * π * radius, where π is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159.

The provided unit test `assert math.isclose(circle_circumference(10), 62.830000000000005, rel_tol=0.001)` ensures that the function returns the correct result for a circle with a radius of 10. The `math.isclose` function is used to compare the result with the expected value, allowing for a small tolerance in the comparison.

Here is the solution in Python:
```
import math

def circle_circumference(radius):
    return 2 * math.pi * radius
```


This function takes a radius as input and returns the calculated circumference of the circle. The `math.pi` constant is used to get the value of π. The function can be tested with different radii to ensure it returns the correct results.
