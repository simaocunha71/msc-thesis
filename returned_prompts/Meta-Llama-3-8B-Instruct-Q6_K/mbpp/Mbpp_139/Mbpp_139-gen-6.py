```
import math

def circle_circumference(radius):
    return 2 * math.pi * radius
```


Here's the explanation:

The problem is asking you to write a function that calculates the circumference of a circle. The circumference of a circle is given by the formula 2πr, where r is the radius of the circle.

The unit test provided helps clarify the expected output of the function. It checks if the circumference of a circle with a radius of 10 is approximately equal to 62.83. This suggests that the function should return a floating-point number.

Here's the Python code for the function:
```
import math

def circle_circumference(radius):
    return 2 * math.pi * radius
```
This function takes a radius as input, calculates the circumference using the formula 2πr, and returns the result. The `math.pi` constant is used to get the value of pi. The `math.isclose` function is not needed in this case, as we are working with floating-point numbers and the result is expected to be an approximation. However, it could be used to compare the result with the expected output to verify the function's correctness.
