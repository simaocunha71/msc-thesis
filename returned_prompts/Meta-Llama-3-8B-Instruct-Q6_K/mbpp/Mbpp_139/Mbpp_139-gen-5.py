```
Explanation:
The problem is asking to create a function that calculates the circumference of a circle given its radius. The circumference of a circle is given by the formula 2 * pi * radius. 

The unit test provided, `assert math.isclose(circle_circumference(10), 62.830000000000005, rel_tol=0.001)`, ensures that the function is working correctly by comparing the result of the function with the expected result for a radius of 10. 

The `math.isclose` function is used to compare the results with a relative tolerance of 0.001, which means that the difference between the calculated and expected results must be less than 0.001 to be considered equal. This is necessary because of the limitations of floating point precision. 

The function is then defined as `circle_circumference(radius)` which takes the radius of the circle as an argument and returns its circumference calculated using the formula.
