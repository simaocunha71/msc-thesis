```
import math

def circle_circumference(radius):
    return 2 * math.pi * radius
```







Solution:
The problem is asking to create a function that calculates the circumference of a circle given its radius. The formula to calculate the circumference is 2Ï€r, where r is the radius.

The unit test provided is `assert math.isclose(circle_circumference(10), 62.830000000000005, rel_tol=0.001)`, which means the function should return the exact circumference of a circle with a radius of 10. The result should be close to 62.83.

Here is the solution:
```python
import math

def circle_circumference(radius):
    return 2 * math.pi * radius
```
This function takes a radius as input and returns the circumference of the circle. The `math.pi` constant is used to get the value of pi, which is approximately 3.14159. The function then multiplies this value by 2 and the input radius to get the circumference.
