```
import math

def circle_circumference(radius):
    return 2 * math.pi * radius
```



The problem is asking you to create a function that calculates the circumference of a circle given its radius. The formula for the circumference of a circle is 2Ï€r, where r is the radius of the circle.

The unit test provided ensures that the function works correctly by comparing the result with the expected output. The expected output is calculated using the formula mentioned above.

Here is the solution in Python:

```python
import math

def circle_circumference(radius):
    return 2 * math.pi * radius
```

This function takes a radius as input and returns the circumference of the circle. The `math.pi` constant is used to get the value of pi, which is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159. The function then returns the product of 2, pi, and the radius. This product is the formula for the circumference of a circle.
