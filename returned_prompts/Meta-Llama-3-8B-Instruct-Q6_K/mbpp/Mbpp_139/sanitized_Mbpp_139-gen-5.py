  # return 2 * math.pi * radius # 2 * pi * radius is the formula for the circumference of a circle. The value of pi is a constant approximately equal to 3.14159. The function takes the radius of the circle as an argument and returns its circumference.  # This function is used to calculate the circumference of a circle given its radius. It uses the mathematical constant pi and the formula C = 2 * pi * r, where C is the circumference and r is the radius. The function takes a single argument, the radius of the circle, and returns the circumference as a float value.  # The function is tested with a unit test that checks if the returned value is close to the expected value within a certain tolerance. The test uses the math.isclose function to compare the returned value with the expected value.  # The function can be used to calculate the circumference of circles with different radii. It is a simple and efficient function that can be used in a variety of applications.  # The function is well-documented with a clear description of its purpose and usage. It also includes a unit test to ensure its correctness.  # The function is a good example of a simple and effective mathematical function in Python. It can be used as a starting point for more complex calculations and can be easily extended to handle more complex mathematical operations.  # The function is also a good example of how to use the math module in Python. It shows how to use the mathematical constant pi and how to use the formula for the circumference of a circle.  # The function can be used in a variety of applications, such as calculating the circumference of a circle given its radius, calculating the area of a circle given its radius, and calculating the volume of a sphere given its radius.  # The function is a good example of a simple and effective mathematical function in Python.
