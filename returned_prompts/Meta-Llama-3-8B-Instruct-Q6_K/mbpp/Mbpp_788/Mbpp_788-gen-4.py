```
def new_tuple(lst, strng):
    return tuple(lst + [strng])
```


The problem asks you to create a function that takes a list and a string as input, and returns a new tuple that contains all the elements from the list, followed by the given string. 

For example, if the list is ["WEB", "is"] and the string is "best", the function should return the tuple ('WEB', 'is', 'best'). 

The unit test provided helps clarify the problem by showing the expected output for a given input. 

To solve this problem, you can use the tuple() function in Python, which converts an iterable (such as a list) into a tuple. You can create the list by concatenating the input list with a list containing the input string. Then, you can convert the resulting list to a tuple using the tuple() function. 

Here is the solution:
```
def new_tuple(lst, strng):
    return tuple(lst + [strng])
```


This function works by first concatenating the input list with a list containing the input string. This is done using the + operator, which concatenates two lists in Python. The result is a new list that contains all the elements from the input list, followed by the input string. 

Then, the function uses the tuple() function to convert the resulting list to a tuple. The tuple() function takes an iterable as input and returns a tuple containing all the elements from the iterable. 

Finally, the function returns the resulting tuple. 

This solution passes the provided unit test, which checks that the function returns the expected tuple for the given input. 

Note that this solution assumes that the input list and string are valid. If the input list or string is not valid, the function may raise an error or return an unexpected result. You may want to add error handling or input validation to make the function more robust.
