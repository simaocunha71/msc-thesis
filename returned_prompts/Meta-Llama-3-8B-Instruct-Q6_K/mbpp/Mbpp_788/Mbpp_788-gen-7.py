```
def new_tuple(lst, str):
    return tuple(lst + [str])
```



The problem asks to create a function that takes a list and a string as input, and returns a new tuple that includes all elements from the list and the given string. 

The provided unit test `assert new_tuple(["WEB", "is"], "best") == ('WEB', 'is', 'best')` helps to clarify the expected output. 

One way to solve this problem is to concatenate the list with the string and then convert the result to a tuple. This can be done using the `+` operator to concatenate the list and the string, and the `tuple()` function to convert the result to a tuple. 

Here's the Python function that implements this solution:
```
def new_tuple(lst, str):
    return tuple(lst + [str])
```
This function takes a list `lst` and a string `str` as input, concatenates `lst` with a list containing `str`, and then converts the result to a tuple. The resulting tuple is then returned by the function. 

For example, if we call `new_tuple(["WEB", "is"], "best")`, the function will return the tuple `('WEB', 'is', 'best')`, which matches the expected output in the unit test. 





Note: The problem statement seems to be missing some information, as it doesn't specify what to do with the first character of the list. However, based on the provided unit test, it appears that the first character of the list should be included in the resulting tuple. If the problem statement is corrected to specify that the first character of the list should be ignored, the solution would need to be modified accordingly.
