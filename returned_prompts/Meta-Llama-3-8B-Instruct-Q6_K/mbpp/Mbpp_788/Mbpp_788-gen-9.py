```
def new_tuple(lst, str):
    return tuple([*lst, str])
```


The problem is asking to create a new tuple from a given string and list. The list contains strings, and the string is also a string. We need to concatenate these elements into a tuple.

The unit test `assert new_tuple(["WEB", "is"], "best") == ('WEB', 'is', 'best')` helps to understand that we need to concatenate all elements from the list and the string into a tuple.

Here, `[*lst, str]` is used to concatenate the elements of the list and the string into a list, and then `tuple()` is used to convert this list into a tuple. This is a common way to create a tuple from an iterable in Python.
