```
def new_tuple(string, lst):
    if not isinstance(lst, list):
        raise TypeError("Input list is not a list")
    return tuple([string] + lst)
```





The problem asks you to create a function that takes a string and a list as input and returns a new tuple. The new tuple should contain the input string and all the elements from the input list.

The unit test `assert new_tuple(["WEB", "is"], "best") == ('WEB', 'is', 'best')` helps to clarify the expected behavior of the function. It shows that the input list should be converted to a tuple, and the input string should be added to the beginning of the tuple.

Here is the solution:
```
def new_tuple(string, lst):
    if not isinstance(lst, list):
        raise TypeError("Input list is not a list")
    return tuple([string] + lst)
```
This function first checks if the input `lst` is indeed a list. If it's not, it raises a `TypeError`. Then, it uses the `tuple` function to convert the list to a tuple and adds the input string to the beginning of the tuple using the `+` operator. The result is a new tuple containing the input string and all the elements from the input list.
