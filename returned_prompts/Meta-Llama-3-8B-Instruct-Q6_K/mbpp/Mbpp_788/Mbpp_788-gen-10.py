```
def new_tuple(lst, s):
    return tuple([*lst, s])
```



This problem asks you to create a function that takes a list and a string as input, and returns a new tuple containing all the elements from the list and the string.

The unit test `assert new_tuple(["WEB", "is"], "best") == ('WEB', 'is', 'best')` helps clarify the problem by showing that the function should concatenate the list and string and convert the result to a tuple.

Here's a Python function that solves the problem:

```
def new_tuple(lst, s):
    return tuple([*lst, s])
```

This function uses the `*` operator to unpack the list and the string into separate arguments, and then the `tuple` function to convert the resulting list into a tuple. The `assert` statement in the unit test ensures that the function works correctly.
