The function `check_expression` takes a string expression as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the expression is balanced or not. 

It uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets and parentheses. For each character in the expression, it checks if it is an opening bracket or a closing bracket. If it is an opening bracket, it is pushed onto the stack. If it is a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty (which means there is no matching opening bracket) or if the top of the stack does not match the current closing bracket (which means the brackets are not balanced). If either condition is true, it returns `False`. 

At the end, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, it means all brackets were properly matched and the expression is balanced. If the stack is not empty, it means there are unmatched opening brackets and the expression is not balanced. It returns `True` if the expression is balanced and `False` otherwise. 

The unit test `assert check_expression("{()}[{}]") == True` ensures that the function correctly identifies a balanced expression.
