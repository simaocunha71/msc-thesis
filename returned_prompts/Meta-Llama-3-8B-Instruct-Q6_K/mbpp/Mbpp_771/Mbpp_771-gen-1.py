```
def check_expression(expression):
    stack = []
    mapping = {")": "(", "}": "{", "]": "["}
    for char in expression:
        if char in mapping.values():
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in mapping:
            if not stack or mapping[char] != stack.pop():
                return False
    return not stack
```






The problem is asking to create a function that checks if a given expression is balanced or not. An expression is balanced if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket of the same type. For example, "{()}[{}]" is a balanced expression, but "[{}]" is not.

The unit test provided, `assert check_expression("{()}[{}]") == True`, suggests that the function should return `True` for a balanced expression and `False` otherwise.

Here's a Python solution using a stack to keep track of the opening brackets:

```
def check_expression(expression):
    stack = []
    mapping = {")": "(", "}": "{", "]": "["}
    for char in expression:
        if char in mapping.values():
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in mapping:
            if not stack or mapping[char] != stack.pop():
                return False
    return not stack
```

In this solution, we iterate over the expression character by character. If we encounter an opening bracket, we push it onto the stack. If we encounter a closing bracket, we check if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack doesn't match the current closing bracket. If either of these conditions is true, we return `False`. After iterating over the entire expression, we return whether the stack is empty or not. If the stack is empty, it means all opening brackets have been matched with corresponding closing brackets, so we return `True`. If the stack is not empty, it means there are unmatched opening brackets, so we return `False`.
