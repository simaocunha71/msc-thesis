```
def check_expression(expression):
    stack = []
    mapping = {")": "(", "}": "{", "]": "["}
    for char in expression:
        if char in mapping.values():
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in mapping.keys():
            if not stack or mapping[char] != stack.pop():
                return False
    return not stack
```


The problem is asking to create a function that checks if a given expression is balanced or not. 
For example, the expression "{()}[{}]" is balanced, but "[{}]" is not. 

To solve this problem, we can use a stack data structure. We iterate over the characters in the expression. If we encounter an opening bracket, we push it onto the stack. If we encounter a closing bracket, we check if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack doesn't match the current closing bracket. If either of these conditions is true, we return False, indicating that the expression is not balanced.

Finally, after iterating over all characters, we check if the stack is empty. If it is, we return True, indicating that the expression is balanced. If it's not, we return False.

The unit test `assert check_expression("{()}[{}]") == True` helps to clarify the problem by providing an example of a balanced expression. 

This solution assumes that the expression only contains parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets. If the expression can contain other types of brackets or characters, the solution would need to be modified accordingly.
