def check_expression(expression):

    for char in expression:
        if char in mapping.values():
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in mapping:

The problem asks to create a function that checks if a given expression is balanced or not. The expression can contain parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets. The function should return True if the expression is balanced and False if it's not.

The provided unit test `assert check_expression("{()}[{}]") == True` helps to understand the problem better. It shows that the expression "{()}[{}]" is balanced, which means the function should return True for this expression.

The solution uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. When a closing bracket is encountered, the function checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack does not match the current closing bracket. If either condition is true, the function returns False, indicating that the expression is not balanced. If the function finishes iterating over the expression without returning False, it checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, the function returns True, indicating that the expression is balanced. If the stack is not empty, the function returns False, indicating that the expression is not balanced. 

The mapping dictionary is used to map the closing brackets to their corresponding opening brackets. This helps to check if the brackets match correctly. 

The function works by iterating over the expression, pushing the opening brackets onto the stack, and popping them off when a corresponding closing bracket is encountered. If the stack is empty when a closing bracket is encountered, or if the top of the stack does not match the current closing bracket, the function returns False. If the function finishes iterating over the expression without returning False, it checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, the function returns True, indicating that the expression is balanced. If the stack is not empty, the function returns False, indicating that the expression is not balanced. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the expression, and a space complexity of O(n), where n is the maximum depth of the brackets in the expression.
