            stack.append(char)
        elif char in mapping:

The function `check_expression` checks if the given expression is balanced or not. It uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets and checks if the closing brackets match with the opening ones. If the stack is empty at the end, the function returns True, indicating that the expression is balanced. If the stack is not empty, the function returns False, indicating that the expression is not balanced. The unit test `assert check_expression("{()}[{}]") == True` ensures that the function works correctly.   
   
For example, the expression "{()}[{}]" is balanced because the opening and closing brackets match correctly. The function `check_expression` returns True for this expression. On the other hand, the expression "{(}" is not balanced because the closing bracket does not match with the opening bracket. The function `check_expression` returns False for this expression.   
   
The function works by iterating over the characters in the expression. When it encounters an opening bracket, it pushes it onto the stack. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty or the top of the stack does not match with the closing bracket. If either condition is true, it returns False. If the stack is empty at the end, it returns True. If the stack is not empty, it returns False.   
   
This function can be used to check if any type of brackets, such as parentheses, curly braces, or square brackets, are balanced in an expression. It is a common problem in programming and is often used to validate user input or to check the syntax of a programming language.   
   
The unit test `assert check_expression("{()}[{}]") == True` ensures that the function works correctly for a balanced expression. You can add more unit tests to ensure that the function works correctly for other types of expressions, such as unbalanced expressions or expressions with multiple types of brackets.   
   
You can use this function to check if a given expression is balanced or not. For example, you can use it to validate user input or to check the syntax of a programming language. It is a useful function to have in your toolkit when working with strings and brackets.
