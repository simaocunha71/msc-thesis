Explanation:
The function `check_expression` takes a string `s` as an argument and checks if it is a balanced expression. The expression is balanced if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.
The function uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty (which means there is no corresponding opening bracket) or if the top of the stack does not match with the closing bracket (which means the brackets are not balanced).
If the expression is balanced, the stack should be empty at the end. The function returns `True` if the expression is balanced and `False` otherwise. 

The unit test `assert check_expression("{()}[{}]") == True` ensures that the function returns `True` for a balanced expression. 
The unit test `assert check_expression("{[}])") == False` ensures that the function returns `False` for an unbalanced expression.
