The task is to write a function that takes an expression as input and checks if it is balanced or not. 
A balanced expression is one where every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and they are properly nested.

For example, "{()}[{}]" is a balanced expression, while "{[}]" is not.

We can use a stack data structure to solve this problem. We iterate over the expression, and for each opening bracket, we push it onto the stack. For each closing bracket, we pop the stack. If the stack is empty at the end, the expression is balanced.

Here is the Python code for the function:
```
def check_expression(expression):
    stack = []
    mapping = {")": "(", "}": "{", "]": "["}
    for char in expression:
        if char in mapping.values():
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in mapping.keys():
            if not stack or mapping[char] != stack.pop():
                return False
    return not stack
```
This function iterates over the expression, pushing opening brackets onto the stack and popping them when it encounters a closing bracket. If the stack is empty at the end, the expression is balanced. The unit test `assert check_expression("{()}[{}]") == True` passes with this function.
