```
def kth_element(arr, k):
    return arr[k-1]
```
The problem is asking to find the kth element in a given array. The 1-based indexing means that the first element is at index 1, not 0. For example, if the array is [12, 3, 5, 7, 19], the first element is at index 1, the second element is at index 2, and so on.

The unit test `assert kth_element([12,3,5,7,19], 2) == 3` helps to clarify this. It means that the second element (at index 2) in the array [12, 3, 5, 7, 19] is 3.

The solution is simple. We just need to subtract 1 from k to get the correct index, since Python uses 0-based indexing. Then, we return the element at that index. Here's the code:
```
def kth_element(arr, k):
    return arr[k-1]
```
This function takes two arguments: `arr` is the array, and `k` is the index of the element we want to find. It returns the kth element in the array. The unit test `assert kth_element([12,3,5,7,19], 2) == 3` passes with this function.
