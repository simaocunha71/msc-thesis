```
def kth_element(arr, k):
    k -= 1  # Convert 1-based indexing to 0-based indexing
    if k < 0 or k >= len(arr):
        return None
    return arr[k]
```


The problem is asking you to write a function that finds the kth element in a given array, where k is the 1-based index. For example, if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and k is 2, the function should return 2, which is the second element in the array.

The unit test provided, `assert kth_element([12,3,5,7,19], 2) == 3`, helps to clarify the problem. It shows that the function should return the element at index 1 (which is 0-based indexing), which is 3.

Here's a Python solution for the problem:
```
def kth_element(arr, k):
    k -= 1  # Convert 1-based indexing to 0-based indexing
    if k < 0 or k >= len(arr):
        return None
    return arr[k]
```
This function first converts the 1-based index to 0-based indexing by subtracting 1 from k. Then, it checks if k is within the bounds of the array. If it is, the function returns the element at index k. If k is out of bounds, the function returns None.
