```
def overlapping(seq1, seq2):
    for item in seq1:
        if item in seq2:
            return True
    return False
```
This function iterates over each item in `seq1` and checks if it exists in `seq2`. If it finds a match, it immediately returns `True`. If it doesn't find any matches after checking all items in `seq1`, it returns `False`. 

The unit test `assert overlapping([1,2,3,4,5],[6,7,8,9]) == False` ensures that the function correctly returns `False` when no overlapping values are found in the two sequences.  If the function were to incorrectly return `True`, the unit test would fail.  This ensures that the function is working correctly.  The unit test provides a way to verify that the function behaves as expected. 

This function would work for lists, tuples, or any other type of sequence.  It can be used to check for overlapping values in any type of sequence. 

For example, you could use this function to check if any of the numbers in a list of student IDs appear in a list of banned IDs:
```
banned_ids = [123, 456, 789]
student_ids = [123, 234, 345, 456, 567]
if overlapping(student_ids, banned_ids):
    print("Overlapping IDs found")
else:
    print("No overlapping IDs found")
``` 
In this example, the function would print "Overlapping IDs found" because the IDs 123 and 456 are in both lists.  If the lists were disjoint, the function would print "No overlapping IDs found".  This function provides a way to check for overlapping values in any type of sequence.  It's a flexible and reusable solution that can be applied to a wide range of problems.  It's easy to understand and use, making it a good choice for many applications.  It's also efficient, with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the longer sequence.  This means that it can handle large sequences without becoming too slow.  It's a good choice for a wide range of applications, from simple checks to complex data analysis tasks.  It's a versatile and reliable solution that can be trusted to work correctly in a wide range of situations.  It's a good choice for any application where you need to check for overlapping values in a sequence.  It's a simple and
