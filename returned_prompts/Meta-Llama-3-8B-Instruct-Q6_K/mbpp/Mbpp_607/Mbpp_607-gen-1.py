import re

def find_literals(text, pattern):
    match = re.search(pattern, text)
    if match:
        return match.group(), match.start(), match.end()
    else:
        return None
```
This function uses the re module to search for the pattern in the text. The re.search function returns a match object if the pattern is found in the text, and None otherwise. The group method of the match object returns the matching substring, and the start and end methods return the start and end indices of the match. The function returns a tuple containing the matching substring, start index, and end index. If the pattern is not found in the text, the function returns None. 

The unit test `assert find_literals('The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.', 'fox') == ('fox', 16, 19)` ensures that the function returns the correct result for the given input. It checks that the function returns the string 'fox', and the start and end indices 16 and 19, respectively. 

Note that the start and end indices are 0-based, meaning that the first character in the string is at index 0. 

The function can be used to search for a regex pattern in a string, and it returns the matching substring, start index, and end index. It can be used in a variety of applications, such as text processing, data analysis, and data mining. 

For example, you can use this function to extract a specific pattern from a text, such as extracting all the dates from a text. You can also use it to validate the format of a string, such as checking if a string matches a specific pattern. 

The function is case-sensitive, meaning that it will only match the pattern if it is exactly the same in the text. If you want the function to be case-insensitive, you can use the re.IGNORECASE flag when compiling the regex pattern. For example, `re.compile(pattern, re.IGNORECASE)`. 

The function can also be used to search for multiple patterns in a text. You can use the re.finditer function to find all matches of the pattern in the text, and then use the group, start, and end methods to get the matching substring, start index, and end index for each match. 

For example:
```
import re

text = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The dog is very lazy.'
pattern = 'fox|dog'
matches = re.finditer(pattern, text)
