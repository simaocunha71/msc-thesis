import re

def find_literals(text, pattern):
    match = re.search(pattern, text)
    if match:
        return match.group(), match.start(), match.end()
    else:
        return None
```
This function uses the `re.search` function to search the `text` for the `pattern`. If a match is found, it returns the match as a string, the start index of the match, and the end index of the match. If no match is found, it returns `None`. 

The `assert` statement in the problem description checks that the function returns the correct result for the input `'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'` and `'fox'`. This helps to verify that the function is working correctly. 

Note that the `re.search` function returns a `match` object, which has methods for accessing the match and its position. The `group` method returns the matched string, the `start` method returns the start index of the match, and the `end` method returns the end index of the match. 

The `if match:` statement checks if a match was found, and if so, it returns the match as a string, the start index of the match, and the end index of the match. If no match was found, it returns `None`. 

The `re` module is imported at the beginning of the function to use its functions. 

The function is designed to be flexible and can be used to search for any regex pattern in a string. The `pattern` parameter should be a valid regex pattern, and the `text` parameter should be a string to search for the pattern. 

For example, if you want to search for the word "fox" in the string "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", you can call the function like this: `find_literals('The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.', 'fox')`. This will return the string "fox", the start index of the match (16), and the end index of the match (19). 

If you want to search for a more complex pattern, you can modify the `pattern` parameter accordingly. For example, if you want to search for the pattern "fox|dog" in the same string, you can call the function like this: `find_literals('The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.', 'fox|dog')`. This will return the first match it finds, either "fox" or "dog".
