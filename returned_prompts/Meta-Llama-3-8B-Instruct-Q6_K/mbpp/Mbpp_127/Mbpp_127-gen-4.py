def multiply_int(a, b):
    return a*b
```
This function takes two integers as input and returns their product. The unit test provided, `assert multiply_int(10,20)==200`, ensures that the function works correctly. The function itself is straightforward, simply returning the product of the two input integers.  This is the most basic implementation of integer multiplication. If you want to handle more complex cases such as multiplication of large integers or negative integers, you would need to use a more advanced method.  For example, you could use a library like `numpy` or `mpmath` to handle large integers, or you could implement your own method for handling negative integers.  However, for the simple case of multiplying two integers, this function should work fine.
