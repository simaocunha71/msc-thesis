```
def multiply_int(a, b):
    return a * b
```
The problem is asking to write a function that multiplies two integers. 

The unit test provided, `assert multiply_int(10,20)==200`, suggests that the function should return the product of the two integers. 

This can be achieved by using the built-in multiplication operator `*` in Python. The function `multiply_int` takes two integer arguments `a` and `b`, and returns their product. 

For example, `multiply_int(10, 20)` would return `200`, which is the product of `10` and `20`.  This solution passes the provided unit test.  It is also a simple and efficient solution, as it uses the built-in multiplication operator which is optimized by the Python interpreter.
