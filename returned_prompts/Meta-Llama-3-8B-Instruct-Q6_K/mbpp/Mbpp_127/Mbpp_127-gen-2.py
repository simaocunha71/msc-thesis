```
def multiply_int(a, b):
    return a * b
```


The problem is asking to create a function that multiplies two integers. 

The unit test provided, `assert multiply_int(10,20)==200`, suggests that the function should take two integers as input and return their product.

Here's a simple Python function that accomplishes this:

```
def multiply_int(a, b):
    return a * b
```

This function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns their product. The unit test provided confirms that this function works correctly. For example, `multiply_int(10, 20)` returns `200`, which is the product of `10` and `20`.
