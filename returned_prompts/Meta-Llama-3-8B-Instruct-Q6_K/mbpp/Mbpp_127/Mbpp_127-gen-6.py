```
def multiply_int(a, b):
    return a * b
```
The problem is asking to create a function that multiplies two integers. The unit test provided, `assert multiply_int(10,20)==200`, suggests that the function should return the product of the two integers.

The solution is a simple function that takes two integer arguments and returns their product. This can be achieved using the multiplication operator (`*`) in Python. The function is defined as `multiply_int(a, b)` and returns `a * b`. This solution passes the given unit test.
