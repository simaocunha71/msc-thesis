def multiply_int(a, b):
    return a * b
```
This function takes two integers as input and returns their product. The unit test `assert multiply_int(10,20)==200` ensures that the function works correctly. The function uses the built-in multiplication operator `*` to perform the multiplication.  This is a very basic function and can be improved in terms of performance and usability, but it meets the requirements of the problem. 

Note: The unit test `assert multiply_int(10,20)==200` checks if the function returns the correct result for the input values 10 and 20. If the function returns 200 for these inputs, the test passes; otherwise, it fails. This helps to ensure that the function works correctly.  You can add more unit tests to cover different scenarios and ensure the function works correctly for all cases.  For example, you could add tests for different types of inputs (e.g., negative numbers, zero, large numbers), different operations (e.g., addition, subtraction), and edge cases (e.g., division by zero).  This can help to catch errors and improve the reliability of the function.  However, in this case, the function is very simple and just performs a basic multiplication, so there is not much room for improvement or additional testing.  If you were to extend this function to handle more complex operations or edge cases, you would need to add more tests to ensure it works correctly.  For example, you could add a test for dividing by zero, or for multiplying large numbers.  This would help to catch any errors or unexpected behavior and ensure the function works correctly in all scenarios.  However, for this specific function, the unit test provided is sufficient to ensure it works correctly.  You can run the test by calling `assert multiply_int(10,20)==200` and if the result is 200, the test passes.  If the result is not 200, the test fails.  This helps to ensure that the function works correctly.  You can add more tests to cover different scenarios and ensure the function works correctly for all cases.
