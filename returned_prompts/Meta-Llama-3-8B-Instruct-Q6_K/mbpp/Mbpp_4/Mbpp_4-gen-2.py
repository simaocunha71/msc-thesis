import heapq

def heap_queue_largest(lst, n):
    return heapq.nlargest(n, lst)
```


This function uses the `nlargest` function from the `heapq` module, which returns the n largest elements from the iterable specified. The iterable in this case is the input list `lst`. The function returns the n largest elements in descending order. The unit test provided in the question confirms that the function works correctly. For example, the test `assert heap_queue_largest( [25, 35, 22, 85, 14, 65, 75, 22, 58],3)==[85, 75, 65]` checks that the function returns the 3 largest integers from the given list in descending order, which is `[85, 75, 65]`. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(n log k), where n is the number of elements in the input list and k is the number of largest elements to be returned. The `nlargest` function uses a heap data structure to store the n largest elements, and the heap operations (insertion and extraction of the maximum element) take O(log k) time each. Therefore, the total time complexity is O(n log k). 

The space complexity is O(k), as the function needs to store the k largest elements in the heap. In the worst case, the heap can store all n elements, so the space complexity is O(n). However, in practice, the heap will typically store fewer than n elements, so the space complexity is often O(k). 

In summary, this function is efficient and easy to use, and it is suitable for finding the n largest integers from a large list of numbers. 

Here's how you could use this function:
```
numbers = [25, 35, 22, 85, 14, 65, 75, 22, 58]
n = 3
result = heap_queue_largest(numbers, n)
print(result)  # Output: [85, 75, 65]
``` 
This code would find the 3 largest integers from the list `numbers` and print the result. The output would be `[85, 75, 65]`, which are the 3 largest integers from the list in descending order.
