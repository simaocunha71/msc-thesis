```
import heapq

def heap_queue_largest(nums, n):
    return heapq.nlargest(n, nums)
```


The problem is asking for a function that takes a list of numbers and an integer n as input, and returns the n largest integers from the list in descending order.

The provided unit test suggests that the function should return the top n largest integers, which is a common interpretation of the problem.

The solution uses the `heapq.nlargest` function, which returns the n largest elements from the iterable specified by the input list. The `nlargest` function uses a heap data structure to efficiently find the n largest elements, making it a suitable choice for this problem.

Here's the solution:
```
import heapq

def heap_queue_largest(nums, n):
    return heapq.nlargest(n, nums)
```
This function takes two inputs: `nums` (the list of numbers) and `n` (the number of largest integers to return). It returns a list of the n largest integers from `nums`, in descending order. The `heapq.nlargest` function does the heavy lifting, using a heap to efficiently find the n largest elements. The result is a list of the top n largest integers from the input list.
