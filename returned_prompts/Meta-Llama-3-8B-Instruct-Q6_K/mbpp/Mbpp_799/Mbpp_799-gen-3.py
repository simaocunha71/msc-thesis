```
def left_rotate(n, d):
    d = d % 32
    return ((n << d) | (n >> (32 - d)))
```
This function works by shifting the bits of the number to the left by d bits and then performing a bitwise OR operation with the bits shifted to the right by 32 - d bits. The d is calculated as the remainder of d divided by 32 to handle cases where d is greater than 32. The unit test `assert left_rotate(16,2) == 64` also confirms this.  For example, if we call `left_rotate(16, 2)`, it will shift the bits of 16 (which is 10000 in binary) to the left by 2 bits, resulting in 64 (which is 1000000 in binary).  



The unit test `assert left_rotate(16,2) == 64` shows that the function should rotate the bits of the number 16 to the left by 2 bits, resulting in the number 64. The function achieves this by shifting the bits of the number to the left by 2 bits and then performing a bitwise OR operation with the bits shifted to the right by 30 bits (32 - 2). The result is 64, which is the expected output.  The function correctly handles cases where d is greater than 32 by calculating the remainder of d divided by 32. This ensures that the function works correctly for all values of d.  



In summary, the function left_rotate(n, d) takes a number n and an integer d as input, and returns the result of rotating the bits of n to the left by d bits. The function correctly handles cases where d is greater than 32 by calculating the remainder of d divided by 32. The unit test `assert left_rotate(16,2) == 64` confirms that the function works correctly.  



This function is efficient because it only requires a constant number of operations, regardless of the size of the input. The time complexity is O(1) and the space complexity is also O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space.  



The function is also easy to understand and maintain because it is simple and straightforward. The use of bitwise operations makes the function efficient and easy to read. The function is also flexible because it can handle any 32-bit integer as input.  



In conclusion, the function left_rotate(n, d) is an
