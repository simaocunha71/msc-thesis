```
def left_rotate(n, d):
    return ((n << d) | (n >> (32 - d)))
```
The problem is asking to write a function that rotates the bits of a given number to the left by a certain number of positions. The number is assumed to be 32 bits long. 

The unit test `assert left_rotate(16,2) == 64` helps in understanding the problem. It means that if the number is 16 and the number of positions to rotate is 2, the output should be 64.

The function `left_rotate` uses bitwise operators to solve this problem. The left shift operator `<<` is used to shift the bits of the number to the left by the given number of positions. The right shift operator `>>` is used to shift the bits of the number to the right by the number of positions that would be left out after the left shift. The `|` operator is used to combine the two parts of the number after the left and right shifts.

For example, if the number is 16 and the number of positions to rotate is 2, the function would shift the bits of 16 to the left by 2 positions, resulting in 64, and then combine the two parts of the number using the `|` operator. The result would be 64.
