```
def left_rotate(n, d):
    d = d % 32
    mask = (1 << d) - 1
    return ((n << d) | (n >> (32 - d))) & ~mask
```


This function works by first calculating the number of bits to shift (d) and creating a mask to clear the bits that should be shifted out. It then uses bitwise operations to left shift the bits of the number by d bits and right shift the bits that fell off the left end back in. The mask is then used to clear the bits that should be shifted out. The result is the number with its bits rotated to the left by d bits.

The unit test `assert left_rotate(16,2) == 64` is used to test the function with the number 16 and the number of bits to shift (2). The expected result is 64, which is the result of rotating the bits of 16 to the left by 2 bits. 





This problem is about creating a function that takes an integer and a number of bits as input and returns the result of rotating the integer's bits to the left by that many bits. The rotation is circular, meaning that the bits that fall off the left end are moved to the right end.

The unit test `assert left_rotate(16,2) == 64` is used to test the function with the number 16 and the number of bits to shift (2). The expected result is 64, which is the result of rotating the bits of 16 to the left by 2 bits. 

The function `left_rotate` takes two parameters: `n` (the number to rotate) and `d` (the number of bits to shift). It first calculates the remainder of `d` divided by 32, because there are only 32 bits in an integer. It then creates a mask to clear the bits that should be shifted out. The mask is calculated by creating a number with `d` bits set to 1 and the rest set to 0.

The function then uses bitwise operations to left shift the bits of the number by `d` bits and right shift the bits that fell off the left end back in. The mask is then used to clear the bits that should be shifted out. The result is the number with its bits rotated to the left by `d` bits. 

The function is then tested with the unit test `assert left_rotate(16,2) == 64
