def reverse_words(s):
    words = s.split()
    words = words[::-1]
    return ' '.join(words)
assert reverse_words("python program") == "program python"  # test case
print(reverse_words("python program"))  # output: "program python"  # test output

Explanation:
The problem asks you to create a function that takes a string as an input and returns the string with its words reversed. For example, if the input is "hello world", the output should be "world hello".

The unit test provided helps to understand the problem better. It shows that the function should reverse the order of the words in the string, not the words themselves.

Here is the solution in Python:
```
def reverse_words(s):
    words = s.split()
    words = words[::-1]
    return ' '.join(words)
```
This function works by first splitting the input string into a list of words using the `split` method. Then, it reverses the order of the words in the list using slicing (`words[::-1]`). Finally, it joins the reversed list of words back into a string using the `join` method. The result is the input string with its words in reverse order.  # test output

When you run the function with the input "python program", it returns "program python", which is the expected output.  # test case

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of words in the input string, because it needs to iterate over the words to reverse their order. The space complexity is also O(n), because it needs to store the list of words in memory.  # test output
