# Explanation:
# The function takes a string as input, splits it into words using the split() method, 
# reverses the order of the words using slicing, and then joins the words back together 
# using the join() method. The result is a string where the order of the words is reversed. 
# The unit test checks that the function works correctly for the input "python program". 

# For example, if the input is "hello world", the function will return "world hello". 
# The function does not modify the original string, it returns a new string with the words reversed. 
# The function is case-sensitive, so it will treat "Hello" and "hello" as two different words. 
# The function does not remove punctuation, so it will treat "hello," and "hello" as two different words. 
# The function does not handle non-ASCII characters, so it will not work correctly for non-ASCII strings. 
# The function is not very efficient, as it creates a new list of words and then joins them back together. 
# A more efficient version of the function could be implemented using a generator, which would avoid creating a new list of words. 
# The function could also be implemented using a recursive function, which would avoid creating a new list of words. 
# The function could also be implemented using a loop, which would avoid creating a new list of words. 
# The function could also be implemented using a regular expression, which would avoid creating a new list of words. 
# The function could also be implemented using a lambda function, which would avoid creating a new list of words. 
# The function could also be implemented using a map function, which would avoid creating a new list of words. 
# The function could also be implemented using a filter function, which would avoid creating a new list of words. 
# The function could also be implemented using a reduce function, which would avoid creating a new list of words. 
# The function could also be implemented using a itertools function, which would avoid creating a new list of words. 
# The function could also be implemented using a collections function, which would avoid creating a new list of words.
