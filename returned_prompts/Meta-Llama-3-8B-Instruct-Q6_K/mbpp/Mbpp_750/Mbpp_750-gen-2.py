def add_tuple(lst, tup):
    return lst + list(tup)
```
This function takes a list and a tuple as input, and returns a new list that is the concatenation of the input list and the input tuple. The unit test `assert add_tuple([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) == [5, 6, 7, 9, 10]` ensures that the function works correctly. The function uses the `+` operator to concatenate the list and the tuple, which converts the tuple to a list. This is necessary because the `+` operator cannot directly concatenate a list and a tuple. 

For example, if you call `add_tuple([5, 6, 7], (9, 10))`, the function will return the list `[5, 6, 7, 9, 10]`. 

This function is useful when you need to add a tuple to a list, such as when you have a list of numbers and a tuple of numbers that you want to combine. It is also useful when you have a list of values and a tuple of values that you want to add to the list. 

This function is efficient because it uses the `+` operator to concatenate the list and the tuple, which is a built-in operation in Python. This means that the function does not have to iterate over the list and the tuple, which would make it less efficient. 

This function is also easy to use because it takes a list and a tuple as input, and returns a new list that is the concatenation of the input list and the input tuple. This makes it easy to use the function to add a tuple to a list, without having to write a lot of code. 

This function is also flexible because it can be used with any type of list and any type of tuple. This means that you can use the function to add a tuple of strings to a list of strings, or a tuple of integers to a list of integers. 

Overall, this function is a simple and efficient way to add a tuple to a list in Python. It is easy to use and flexible, making it a useful tool for working with lists and tuples. 

Here is the unit test:
```
assert add_tuple([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) == [5, 6, 7, 9, 10]
``` 
This unit test checks that the function works correctly by
