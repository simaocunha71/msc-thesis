```
def add_tuple(lst, tup):
    return lst + list(tup)
```
This function takes a list and a tuple as input, and returns a new list that contains all the elements of the input list and tuple. The `list()` function is used to convert the tuple to a list, which can then be concatenated with the input list using the `+` operator. 

The unit test `assert add_tuple([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) == [5, 6, 7, 9, 10]` confirms that the function works as expected. It checks that when the function is called with the list `[5, 6, 7]` and the tuple `(9, 10)`, it returns the list `[5, 6, 7, 9, 10]`. 

Note that the `+` operator for lists in Python concatenates the lists, rather than adding the elements. This is why the function works as expected, even though it doesn't actually "add" the tuple to the list in the mathematical sense. Instead, it combines the two lists into a new list.
