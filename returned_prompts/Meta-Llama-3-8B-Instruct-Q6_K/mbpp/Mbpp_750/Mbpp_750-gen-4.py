```
def add_tuple(lst, tup):
    lst.extend(tup)
    return lst
```


The problem is asking to write a function that takes a list and a tuple as input, and returns the list with the tuple's elements added to it.

The given unit test `assert add_tuple([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) == [5, 6, 7, 9, 10]` helps to clarify the problem.

The solution is to use the `extend` method of the list, which adds all the elements of the tuple to the list. Here is the implementation:
```
def add_tuple(lst, tup):
    lst.extend(tup)
    return lst
```
This function takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tup` as input, adds the elements of `tup` to `lst` using the `extend` method, and returns the updated list. The `extend` method modifies the list in place, so the function does not need to return the modified list explicitly. However, the unit test `assert add_tuple([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) == [5, 6, 7, 9, 10]` requires the function to return the modified list. Therefore, the function returns the modified list.
