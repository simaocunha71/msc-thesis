```
def add_tuple(lst, t):
    return lst + t
```
The problem is asking to write a function that adds a tuple to a given list. The function should return the resulting list.

The unit test `assert add_tuple([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) == [5, 6, 7, 9, 10]` helps to clarify the problem by providing an example of the expected output.

The solution is to use the concatenation operator `+` to combine the list and the tuple. This is a built-in operation in Python that returns a new list containing all elements from the original lists and tuples. The resulting list is then returned by the function.

Note that the function does not modify the original list, but returns a new list with the tuple added to it. This is important because lists are mutable, and modifying them in place could have unintended consequences. By returning a new list, the function ensures that the original list remains unchanged.
