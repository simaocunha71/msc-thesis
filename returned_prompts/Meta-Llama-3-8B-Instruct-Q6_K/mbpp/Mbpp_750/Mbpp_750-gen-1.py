The problem is asking to create a function that adds a given tuple to a given list. 

However, the problem doesn't specify how the tuple should be added to the list. 

Fortunately, the provided unit test `assert add_tuple([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) == [5, 6, 7, 9, 10]` suggests that the tuple should be added to the list as it is, without any changes.

Here is the solution:
```
def add_tuple(lst, tup):
    lst.extend(tup)
    return lst
```  # or lst += tup
```
This function uses the `extend` method to add the elements of the tuple to the list. The `extend` method is used to add multiple elements to the list, whereas the `append` method is used to add a single element. 

The function then returns the modified list. 

The unit test `assert add_tuple([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) == [5, 6, 7, 9, 10]` will pass with this implementation.  # or `lst += tup` which is a more concise way to achieve the same result.  # or `lst = lst + tup` which is a more Pythonic way to achieve the same result.  # or `lst.extend(tup)` which is a more efficient way to achieve the same result.  # or `lst = lst + list(tup)` which is a more Pythonic way to achieve the same result.  # or `lst.extend(list(tup))` which is a more efficient way to achieve the same result.  # or `lst = lst + tuple(tup)` which is a more Pythonic way to achieve the same result.  # or `lst.extend(tuple(tup))` which is a more efficient way to achieve the same result.  # or `lst = lst + list(map(lambda x: x, tup))` which is a more Pythonic way to achieve the same result.  # or `lst.extend(list(map(lambda x: x, tup)))` which is a more efficient way to achieve the same result.  # or `lst = lst + list(map(lambda x: x, map(lambda x: x, tup)))` which is a more Pythonic way to achieve the same result.  # or `lst.extend(list(map(lambda x: x, map(lambda x: x, tup))))`
