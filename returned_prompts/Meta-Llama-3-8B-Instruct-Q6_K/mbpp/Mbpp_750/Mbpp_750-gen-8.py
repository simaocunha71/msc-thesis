```
def add_tuple(lst, tup):
    lst.extend(tup)
    return lst
```


In this function, we use the extend method of the list, which adds all elements from the tuple to the end of the list. This method modifies the original list. If you don't want to modify the original list, you can return the result of the extend method or use list concatenation: `return lst + list(tup)`.

The unit test `assert add_tuple([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) == [5, 6, 7, 9, 10]` ensures that the function adds the elements of the tuple to the end of the list. The test passes because the output of the function matches the expected output. 





```
def add_tuple(lst, tup):
    return lst + list(tup)
```


This function takes a list and a tuple as input, converts the tuple to a list, and then concatenates the two lists using the + operator. The result is a new list that contains all elements from the original list and the tuple. This function does not modify the original list. 





```
def add_tuple(lst, tup):
    lst += list(tup)
    return lst
```


This function takes a list and a tuple as input, converts the tuple to a list, and then adds all elements from the tuple to the end of the list using the += operator. The result is the original list with the elements from the tuple appended to it. This function modifies the original list. 





```
def add_tuple(lst, tup):
    return lst[:]+list(tup)
```


This function takes a list and a tuple as input, converts the tuple to a list, and then concatenates the original list and the tuple using the + operator. The result is a new list that contains all elements from the original list and the tuple. This function does not modify the original list. 





```
def add_tuple(lst, tup):
    new_lst = lst[:]
    new_lst.extend(list(tup))
    return new_lst
```


This function takes a list and a tuple as input, makes a copy of the original list, converts the tuple to a list, and then adds all elements from the tuple to the end of the copied list using the extend method. The result is a new list that contains all elements from the original list and the tuple. This function does not modify the original list.
