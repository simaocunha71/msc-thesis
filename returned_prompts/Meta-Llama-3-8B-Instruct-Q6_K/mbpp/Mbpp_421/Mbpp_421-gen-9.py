```
def concatenate_tuple(t):
    return '-'.join(map(str, t))
```
The problem is asking to write a function that takes a tuple as an input and returns a string where each element of the tuple is concatenated with a delimiter. 

For example, if the input tuple is ("ID", "is", 4, "UTS"), the output should be 'ID-is-4-UTS'.

The unit test `assert concatenate_tuple(("ID", "is", 4, "UTS") ) == 'ID-is-4-UTS'` helps to clarify that the default delimiter should be '-'.

Here's a Python solution using the `join` function and `map` function:

```python
def concatenate_tuple(t):
    return '-'.join(map(str, t))
```

This function works by first converting each element of the tuple to a string using `map(str, t)`. Then, it joins these strings together with a '-' delimiter using `join`. The result is a string where each element of the tuple is concatenated with a '-' delimiter.
