```
def concatenate_tuple(tup, sep='-'):
    return sep.join(map(str, tup))
```


The unit test `assert concatenate_tuple(("ID", "is", 4, "UTS") ) == 'ID-is-4-UTS'` suggests that we should concatenate each element of the tuple by the delimiter. The default delimiter is a hyphen. 

The function `concatenate_tuple` takes a tuple and an optional delimiter as input. It uses the `join` method of the delimiter to concatenate each element of the tuple. The `map` function is used to convert each element to a string before concatenation. This way, the function can handle tuples containing elements of different types, including strings, integers, and floats. The `sep` parameter is optional and defaults to a hyphen. 

For example, `concatenate_tuple(("ID", "is", 4, "UTS"))` would return `'ID-is-4-UTS'`. 

Please note that the original problem statement seems to be missing a detail about handling non-string elements. However, the provided unit test suggests that non-string elements should be converted to strings before concatenation. This is why the `map` function is used to convert each element to a string.  If you want to handle non-string elements differently, you would need to adjust the function accordingly.  For example, you might want to raise an error if a non-string element is encountered, or you might want to replace non-string elements with a specific value, such as an empty string.  The `map` function provides a way to apply a transformation to each element in the tuple before concatenation, which can be useful in these cases.  However, the exact behavior would depend on the specific requirements of your problem.  In this case, the `map` function is used to convert each element to a string, which is a common approach when concatenating elements of different types.  This ensures that all elements are treated as strings, which can be useful when working with strings and other data types.  For example, if you have a tuple containing a string, an integer, and a float, the `map` function would convert each element to a string before concatenation.  This would result in a single string that contains the original elements, with each element separated by the delimiter.  This can be useful when working with data that includes different types of elements.  In summary, the `map` function provides a way to apply a transformation to
