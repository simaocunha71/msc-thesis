```
def concatenate_tuple(t):
    return '-'.join(map(str, t))
```



The unit test provided ensures that the function should concatenate each element of the tuple by the delimiter and return the result as a string. The unit test `assert concatenate_tuple(("ID", "is", 4, "UTS") ) == 'ID-is-4-UTS'` demonstrates this by checking that the output of the function is `'ID-is-4-UTS'`.

Here is a Python function that solves the problem. It uses the `join` method to concatenate each element of the tuple with the delimiter `-`. The `map` function is used to convert each element to a string before joining. This ensures that the function works correctly even if the tuple contains non-string elements. 

Here is the Python function:

```
def concatenate_tuple(t):
    return '-'.join(map(str, t))
```



This function takes a tuple `t` as input and returns a string where each element of the tuple is concatenated by the delimiter `-`. The `map` function is used to convert each element to a string before joining, and the `join` method is used to concatenate the elements with the delimiter. The function works correctly even if the tuple contains non-string elements, as it converts them to strings before joining. The unit test `assert concatenate_tuple(("ID", "is", 4, "UTS") ) == 'ID-is-4-UTS'` demonstrates that the function works correctly. 





This solution is efficient and easy to understand. It uses the built-in Python functions `join` and `map` to concatenate the elements of the tuple in a single line of code. This makes the solution concise and easy to read. The function works correctly even if the tuple contains non-string elements, as it converts them to strings before joining. The unit test demonstrates that the function works correctly and ensures that the solution is correct.
