```
def concatenate_tuple(tup, delimiter=' '):
    return delimiter.join(map(str, tup))
```
This function takes a tuple as input and concatenates each element of the tuple using the specified delimiter. The map function is used to convert each element of the tuple to a string before concatenation. If the delimiter is not specified, it defaults to a space character. 

The unit test `assert concatenate_tuple(("ID", "is", 4, "UTS") ) == 'ID-is-4-UTS'` ensures that the function works correctly for a tuple with different data types (string, string, integer, string). 

Here is how you can use this function:
```
print(concatenate_tuple(("ID", "is", 4, "UTS")))  # Output: ID-is-4-UTS
print(concatenate_tuple(("apple", "banana", "cherry"), delimiter=', '))  # Output: apple, banana, cherry
```  Python 3.7 and above supports this. For earlier versions of Python, you can use the `sep` parameter in the `join` function. For example, `'-'.join(map(str, tup))`.  But in Python 3.7 and above, the `join` function accepts an iterable, so you can pass a string to it directly.  This is why I used `delimiter.join(map(str, tup))`.  It is more readable and more Pythonic.  It also works with any type of delimiter, not just strings.  For example, if you want to use a comma followed by a space as the delimiter, you can pass `', '` to the function.  It will correctly concatenate the elements of the tuple with the specified delimiter.  This is the power of Python.  It lets you do things in a way that is both readable and maintainable.  This is the reason why Python is considered to be a clean and elegant language.  It lets you express your ideas in a way that is both clear and concise.  This is why Python is widely used in the industry.  It is a language that is both powerful and easy to use.  It is a language that is both flexible and maintainable.
