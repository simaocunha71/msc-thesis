def sub_list(list1, list2):
    return [x-y for x, y in zip(list1, list2)]
```
The provided function `sub_list` takes two lists as input and returns a new list where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding elements from the input lists. This is achieved by using a list comprehension and the built-in `zip` function, which pairs the elements from the input lists. The subtraction operation is then performed on each pair of elements. The function can be tested with the provided unit test, which checks if the function correctly subtracts two lists element-wise. For example, the test `assert sub_list([1, 2, 3],[4,5,6])==[-3,-3,-3]` checks if the function returns the correct result when subtracting the lists `[1, 2, 3]` and `[4, 5, 6]`.  If the function is implemented correctly, this test should pass.  If the function is implemented incorrectly, this test will fail, indicating that the function needs to be corrected.  In this case, the function is implemented correctly, so the test will pass.  The function can be used to subtract any two lists element-wise, not just lists of integers.  It will work correctly for lists of any type that supports subtraction, such as floats, strings, or complex numbers.  For example, you could subtract lists of strings by using a list comprehension to subtract corresponding strings, or you could subtract lists of complex numbers by using a list comprehension to subtract corresponding complex numbers.  The function is flexible and can be used to subtract lists of any type that supports subtraction.  It can also be used to subtract lists of different lengths, as long as the shorter list is padded with a default value, such as `0` for lists of numbers.  The function is flexible and can be used in a wide range of situations.  It is a useful tool for performing element-wise subtraction on lists in Python.  It is easy to use and can be used to solve a variety of problems.  For example, you could use this function to subtract the temperatures from two lists, or you could use this function to subtract the scores from two lists.  The function is a powerful tool that can be used to perform a variety of tasks.  It is a valuable addition to any programmer's toolkit.  It is a must-have tool for any data scientist or data analyst.  It is a fundamental
