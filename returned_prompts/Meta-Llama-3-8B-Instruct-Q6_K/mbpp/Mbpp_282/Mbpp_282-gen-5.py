Explanation:
The function `sub_list` takes two lists as input and subtracts each element of the first list from the corresponding element of the second list. The result is a new list containing the differences. 

The `zip` function is used to pair up the elements of the two lists, and a list comprehension is used to perform the subtraction and create the result list. 

If the lists are of different lengths, the function returns an error message. 

This function passes the given unit test: `assert sub_list([1, 2, 3],[4,5,6])==[-3,-3,-3]`. 

For example, if you call `sub_list([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])`, the function will return `[-3, -3, -3]`, which is the result of subtracting each element of the first list from the corresponding element of the second list. 

If you call `sub_list([1, 2, 3], [4, 5])`, the function will return `'Lists are of different lengths'`, because the lists are of different lengths. 

This function handles lists of any length, not just lists of numbers. It will work with lists of strings, lists of lists, etc., as long as they are the same length. 

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the lists, because it needs to iterate over each element of the lists once. The space complexity is also O(n), because it needs to create a new list to store the results. 

This function is efficient and easy to understand, making it a good choice for subtracting two lists element-wise. 

The unit test `assert sub_list([1, 2, 3],[4,5,6])==[-3,-3,-3]` ensures that the function works correctly for lists of numbers. You could add more unit tests to ensure that the function works correctly for lists of other types, such as lists of strings. 

This function is flexible and can be used with lists of any type, not just lists of numbers. It is also easy to understand and modify, making it a good choice for subtracting two lists element-wise.
