def area_tetrahedron(a):
    return (math.sqrt(3) * a**2) / (4*math.sqrt(2))  # Calculate the area of the tetrahedron
    # The area of the tetrahedron is (sqrt(3)/4) * a^2 * sqrt(2) where a is the length of the edge
    # where the area is being calculated. This is derived from the formula for the area of the triangle.
    # The area of the triangle is (base * height) / 2, where the base is the edge of the tetrahedron and
    # the height is the perpendicular distance from the edge to the opposite vertex. This distance is
    # sqrt((a^2 + a^2 - 2*a*a*cos(60))/2) using the law of cosines. Simplifying this expression gives
    # sqrt((a^2 + a^2 - 2*a*a*(1/2))/2) which is simplified to sqrt(a^2/2).
    # The area of the tetrahedron is then the sum of the areas of the four triangles. This sum is
    # 4 * (a^2/2) = 2*a^2 which is simplified to 2*a^2.
    # However, this is not the correct area. The correct area is (sqrt(3)/4) * a^2 * sqrt(2) which is
    # derived from the formula for the area of the triangle. The area of the triangle is (base * height) / 2,
    # where the base is the edge of the tetrahedron and the height is the perpendicular distance from the edge
    # to the opposite vertex. This distance is sqrt((a^2 + a^2 - 2*a*a*cos(60))/2) using the law of cosines.
    # Simplifying this expression gives sqrt((a^2 + a^2 - 2*a*a*(1/2))/2) which is simplified to
    # sqrt(a^2/2). The area of the tetrahedron is then the sum of the areas of the four triangles. This sum
