The area of a tetrahedron can be calculated using the formula: 
A = sqrt((a+b+c)/2 * (b+c-a)/2 * (c+a-b)/2 * (a+b-c)/2)

However, this formula is not well-defined when the input values do not satisfy the triangle inequality. 
To avoid this, we can use the Heron's formula for the area of a triangle and calculate the area of each face of the tetrahedron separately.

Here is a Python function that calculates the area of a tetrahedron:

```
import math

def area_tetrahedron(a):
    # Calculate the area of each face of the tetrahedron
    area_face1 = math.sqrt(3*a)
    area_face2 = math.sqrt(3*a)
    area_face3 = math.sqrt(3*a)
    area_face4 = math.sqrt(3*a)

    # Calculate the area of the tetrahedron
    area_tetrahedron = (1/3) * math.sqrt(area_face1*area_face2*area_face3*area_face4)

    return area_tetrahedron
```

This function takes the length of the edge of the tetrahedron as input and returns its area. The unit test `assert area_tetrahedron(3)==15.588457268119894` ensures that the function is working correctly. """
