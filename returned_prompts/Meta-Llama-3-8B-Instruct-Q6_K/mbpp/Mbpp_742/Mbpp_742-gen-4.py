A = sqrt(6*(sqrt(p*(p-a)*(p-b)*(p-c))^2/(1/3*base_area*height)))

However, this formula is not very practical for calculating the area of a tetrahedron. A more practical approach is to use numerical methods to calculate the area.

Here is a Python function that calculates the area of a tetrahedron using numerical methods:

```
import math

def area_tetrahedron(a, b, c, d):
    # Calculate the area of the base triangle
    p = (a + b + c) / 2
    base_area = math.sqrt(p*(p-a)*(p-b)*(p-c))

    # Calculate the volume of the tetrahedron
    height = math.sqrt((a-b)**2 + (b-c)**2 + (c-a)**2)
    volume = 1/3 * base_area * height

    # Calculate the area of the tetrahedron
    area = math.sqrt(6 * (base_area**2) / volume)
    return area
```

This function takes the lengths of the sides of the tetrahedron as input, and returns the area of the tetrahedron. The area is calculated using the formula:

A = sqrt(6*S^2/V)

where S is the area of the base triangle, and V is the volume of the tetrahedron. The area of the base triangle is calculated using Heron's formula, and the volume of the tetrahedron is calculated using the formula:

V = 1/3*base_area*height

where height is the distance from
