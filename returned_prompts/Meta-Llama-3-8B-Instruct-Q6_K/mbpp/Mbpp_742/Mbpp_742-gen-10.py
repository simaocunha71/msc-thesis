The area of a tetrahedron is given by the formula (1/3) * sqrt(p*(p-a)*(p-b)*(p-c)), where p is the perimeter of the tetrahedron, and a, b, c are the lengths of the sides of the tetrahedron.

Here is the Python function to calculate the area of a tetrahedron:

```
import math

def area_tetrahedron(a):
    p = a + a + a + 1
    return (1/3) * math.sqrt(p*(p-a)*(p-a)*(p-a))
```

This function takes one argument, the length of one side of the tetrahedron. The perimeter of the tetrahedron is calculated as the sum of the lengths of the sides, and then the area is calculated using the formula. The result is returned as a float. 

For example, if the length of one side of the tetrahedron is 3, the area of the tetrahedron is 15.588457268119894. This is verified by the unit test:

```
assert area_tetrahedron(3)==15.588457268119894
```  # This test will pass.
```



```
