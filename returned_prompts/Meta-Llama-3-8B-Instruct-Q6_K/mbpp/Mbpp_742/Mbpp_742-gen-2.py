The area of a tetrahedron can be calculated using the formula: sqrt(6*V^2*a^2*b^2*c^2) where V is the volume and a, b, c are the lengths of the edges of the tetrahedron. 

However, we are given a new problem where the volume of the tetrahedron is given as input and we need to calculate the area. 

From the given unit test, we can see that the input is a single number which represents the volume of the tetrahedron. 

The formula to calculate the volume of a tetrahedron is V = sqrt(6*p^2*a^2*b^2*c^2) where p is the height and a, b, c are the lengths of the edges of the tetrahedron.

So, we can use this formula to calculate the area of the tetrahedron. 

Here is the Python function to calculate the area of a tetrahedron:

```
import math

def area_tetrahedron(p):
    a = 1  # Assuming a, b, c are the lengths of the edges of the tetrahedron
    b = 1
    c = 1
    V = p
    area = math.sqrt(6*V**2*a**2*b**2*c**2)
    return area
```
