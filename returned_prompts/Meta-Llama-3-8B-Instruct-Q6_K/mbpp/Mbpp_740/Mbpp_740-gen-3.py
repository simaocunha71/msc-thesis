def tuple_to_dict(t):
    return {t[i]: t[i+1] for i in range(0, len(t), 2)}
```
The function `tuple_to_dict` takes a tuple `t` as input and returns a dictionary where each key is an element from the tuple and its corresponding value is the next element in the tuple. 

The unit test `assert tuple_to_dict((1, 5, 7, 10, 13, 5)) == {1: 5, 7: 10, 13: 5}` ensures that the function works correctly. 

The function uses dictionary comprehension to create the dictionary. It iterates over the tuple using `range(0, len(t), 2)` which starts from the first element and steps by 2. For each iteration, it uses the current element as the key and the next element as the value in the dictionary. 
```
print(tuple_to_dict((1, 5, 7, 10, 13, 5)))
# Output: {1: 5, 7: 10, 13: 5}
