```
def tuple_to_dict(t):
    if len(t) % 2 != 0:
        raise ValueError("Tuple must have an even number of elements")
    result = {}
    for i in range(0, len(t), 2):
        result[t[i]] = t[i+1]
    return result
```


The provided unit test `assert tuple_to_dict((1, 5, 7, 10, 13, 5)) == {1: 5, 7: 10, 13: 5}` helps to clarify the expected behavior of the function. It indicates that the function should convert the given tuple to a dictionary where the first element of each pair is the key and the second element is the value.

Here's a Python function that accomplishes this:

```python
def tuple_to_dict(t):
    if len(t) % 2 != 0:
        raise ValueError("Tuple must have an even number of elements")
    result = {}
    for i in range(0, len(t), 2):
        result[t[i]] = t[i+1]
    return result
```

This function first checks if the length of the tuple is even. If it's not, it raises a ValueError. Then, it initializes an empty dictionary `result`. It iterates over the tuple in steps of 2 using the `range` function, and for each iteration, it adds a key-value pair to the `result` dictionary. The key is the element at the current index `i`, and the value is the element at the next index `i+1`. Finally, it returns the `result` dictionary.
