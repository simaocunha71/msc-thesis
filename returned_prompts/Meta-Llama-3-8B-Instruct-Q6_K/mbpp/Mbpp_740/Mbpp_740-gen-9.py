def tuple_to_dict(t):
    return {t[i]: t[i+1] for i in range(0, len(t)-1, 2)}
```


The unit test `assert tuple_to_dict((1, 5, 7, 10, 13, 5)) == {1: 5, 7: 10, 13: 5}` ensures the function works correctly. It checks if the output of the function with the given tuple as input is equal to the expected output. If the output is not as expected, the function fails. This helps in testing the function and ensures it works as intended.

The function takes a tuple as input and returns a dictionary. It uses a dictionary comprehension to create the dictionary. The comprehension iterates over the tuple with a step of 2, using the current element as the key and the next element as the value. This way, the adjacent elements in the tuple are used to create the key-value pairs in the dictionary. The function correctly handles tuples with an odd number of elements by ignoring the last element. For example, if the input tuple is `(1, 5, 7, 10, 13, 5)`, the function will create the dictionary `{1: 5, 7: 10, 13: 5}`. 

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the tuple. This is because the function iterates over the tuple once. The space complexity is also O(n), as the function creates a dictionary with n/2 key-value pairs, assuming the tuple has an even number of elements. If the tuple has an odd number of elements, the function creates a dictionary with (n-1)/2 key-value pairs.
