The task is to write a function that takes a tuple of elements and returns a dictionary where each element in the tuple is a key and its adjacent element is the corresponding value. For example, if the input tuple is (1, 5, 7, 10, 13, 5), the output dictionary should be {1: 5, 7: 10, 13: 5}.

Here is a Python function that accomplishes this task:

```python
def tuple_to_dict(t):
    if len(t) % 2 != 0:
        raise ValueError("Tuple must have an even number of elements")
    return {t[i]: t[i+1] for i in range(0, len(t), 2)}
```

This function uses dictionary comprehension to create a dictionary where each key-value pair is formed by an element and its adjacent element in the tuple. If the tuple has an odd number of elements, the function raises a ValueError because it's impossible to create a dictionary with an odd number of elements. The unit test `assert tuple_to_dict((1, 5, 7, 10, 13, 5)) == {1: 5, 7: 10, 13: 5}` ensures that the function works correctly.
