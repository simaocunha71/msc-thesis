You can use a dictionary comprehension to create a key-value dictionary from the given tuple. The adjacent elements in the tuple will be treated as key-value pairs.

Here is the Python function that achieves this:

```Python
def tuple_to_dict(t):
    return {t[i]: t[i+1] for i in range(0, len(t), 2)}
```

This function works by iterating over the tuple in steps of 2, using each element as a key and the next element as its corresponding value in the dictionary. The unit test `assert tuple_to_dict((1, 5, 7, 10, 13, 5)) == {1: 5, 7: 10, 13: 5}` ensures that the function works correctly. 

For example, when you call `tuple_to_dict((1, 5, 7, 10, 13, 5))`, it returns `{1: 5, 7: 10, 13: 5}`, which is the expected output.  This function assumes that the tuple has an even number of elements and that the elements are of a type that can be used as dictionary keys. If these assumptions are not met, the function may not work correctly.  In a real-world application, you would need to add error checking code to handle these situations.  For example, you could check that the tuple has an even number of elements and that the elements are of a type that can be used as dictionary keys.  You could also handle the case where the tuple has an odd number of elements by ignoring the last element.  Here is an example of how you could do this:

```Python
def tuple_to_dict(t):
    if len(t) % 2 != 0:
        t = t[:-1]
    return {t[i]: t[i+1] for i in range(0, len(t), 2)}
```

This version of the function will ignore the last element of the tuple if it has an odd number of elements.  It will also raise a KeyError if the tuple has less than two elements or if any element is not hashable.  You could add additional error checking code to handle these situations as needed.  For example, you could use a try-except block to catch the KeyError and return a default value instead of raising an exception.  Here is an example of how you could do this:

```Python
def tuple_to_dict(t):
    if len(t)
