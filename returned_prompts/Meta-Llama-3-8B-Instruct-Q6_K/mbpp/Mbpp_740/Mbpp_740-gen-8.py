```
def tuple_to_dict(t):
    if len(t) % 2 != 0:
        raise ValueError("Tuple length must be even")
    return {t[i]: t[i+1] for i in range(0, len(t), 2)}
```


The function `tuple_to_dict` takes a tuple `t` as input and returns a dictionary where each key is an element from the tuple, and its corresponding value is the next element in the tuple. If the tuple's length is odd, it raises a `ValueError` because the tuple length must be even for this conversion to work.

The unit test `assert tuple_to_dict((1, 5, 7, 10, 13, 5)) == {1: 5, 7: 10, 13: 5}` ensures that the function works correctly. It checks that the function converts the given tuple to the expected dictionary. If the function fails to produce the expected output, it raises an `AssertionError`. 

The function uses a dictionary comprehension to create the key-value pairs from the tuple. It iterates over the tuple in steps of 2 using the `range` function, and for each iteration, it uses the current element as the key and the next element as the value. If the tuple's length is odd, the last element is not used, and the function raises a `ValueError` to indicate that the input is invalid. 

This function assumes that the tuple contains at least two elements. If the tuple is empty, it will raise a `TypeError` when trying to iterate over it. If you want to handle an empty tuple, you can add a check at the beginning of the function to return an empty dictionary in this case. 

For example:
```
def tuple_to_dict(t):
    if len(t) == 0:
        return {}
    if len(t) % 2 != 0:
        raise ValueError("Tuple length must be even")
    return {t[i]: t[i+1] for i in range(0, len(t), 2)}
```


This version of the function returns an empty dictionary if the input tuple is empty, and raises a `ValueError` if the tuple's length is odd. It still uses the same dictionary comprehension to create the key-value pairs from the tuple. 

You can test this function with different inputs, such as an empty tuple, an odd-length tuple, and a tuple with an even number of elements. This will help
