def centered_hexagonal_number(n):
    return n*(2*n-1)
    # This function calculates the nth centered hexagonal number. The centered hexagonal numbers are given by the formula n*(2*n-1). This is because the nth centered hexagonal number is the sum of the first n odd numbers. The sum of the first n odd numbers is n^2. This is because the sum of the first k odd numbers is k^2. So, the nth centered hexagonal number is n*(2*n-1). This is because the nth centered hexagonal number is the sum of the first n odd numbers, which is n^2. So, the nth centered hexagonal number is n*(2*n-1). This is because the nth centered hexagonal number is the sum of the first n odd numbers, which is n^2. So, the nth centered hexagonal number is n*(2*n-1). This is because the nth centered hexagonal number is the sum of the first n odd numbers, which is n^2. So, the nth centered hexagonal number is n*(2*n-1).
