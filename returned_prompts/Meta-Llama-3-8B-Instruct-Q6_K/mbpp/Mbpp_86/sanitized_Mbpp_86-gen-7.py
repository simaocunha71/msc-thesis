def centered_hexagonal_number(n):
    return n*(2*n - 1)
    # The nth centered hexagonal number is n*(2*n - 1) in mathematics. This function calculates the nth centered hexagonal number. It takes the input n as an integer and returns the result as an integer. The function does not require any additional libraries because the formula is simple and does not involve any complex mathematical operations. The function works by directly applying the formula to the input and returning the result. It does not have any error handling because the formula is mathematically correct and the input is expected to be a positive integer. The function is efficient because it only requires a single operation to calculate the result, which is a simple multiplication and subtraction. Therefore, the time complexity of the function is O(1), which means it runs in constant time. The space complexity is also O(1) because it only requires a single variable to store the result. Therefore, the function is efficient and can handle large inputs.  # The nth centered hexagonal number is n*(2*n - 1) in mathematics. This function calculates the nth centered hexagonal number.
