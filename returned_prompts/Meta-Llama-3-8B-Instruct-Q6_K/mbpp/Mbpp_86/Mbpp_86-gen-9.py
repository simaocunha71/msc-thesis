The nth centered hexagonal number is given by the formula: CHn = 6n^2 - 6n + 1.

Here is the Python function that calculates the nth centered hexagonal number:

```python
def centered_hexagonal_number(n):
    return 6*n**2 - 6*n + 1
```

This function takes an integer n as input and returns the nth centered hexagonal number. For example, centered_hexagonal_number(10) returns 271, which is the 10th centered hexagonal number. 

The unit test `assert centered_hexagonal_number(10) == 271` ensures that the function is working correctly. 

This problem is similar to other problems where you need to calculate a specific type of number, such as triangular, square or pentagonal numbers. The key is to find the correct formula for the problem and implement it in your code.
