The nth centered hexagonal number is given by the formula n*(2*n-1). This problem is asking us to write a function that takes an integer n as input and returns the nth centered hexagonal number.

Here is a Python function that accomplishes this:

```
def centered_hexagonal_number(n):
    return n*(2*n-1)
```

This function works by directly applying the formula for the nth centered hexagonal number. For example, `centered_hexagonal_number(10)` returns `271`, which is the 10th centered hexagonal number.

The unit test `assert centered_hexagonal_number(10) == 271` ensures that the function is working correctly. It checks that the output of the function for the input `10` is `271`, which is the correct result. If the function is working correctly, this test will pass. If the function is not working correctly, this test will fail.  This is an example of a test-driven development (TDD) approach to writing software, where we write a test before writing the code. This ensures that the code is working correctly and helps us catch errors early.  In this case, the test ensures that the function is correctly calculating the nth centered hexagonal number.  If the function is not working correctly, the test will fail and we will know that we need to fix the function.  Once the function is working correctly, the test will pass and we will know that the function is working as expected.  This approach to writing software can help us write more reliable and maintainable code.  It also helps us to catch errors early and to ensure that the code is working as expected.  In this case, the test helps us to ensure that the function is correctly calculating the nth centered hexagonal number.  If the function is not working correctly, the test will fail and we will know that we need to fix the function.  Once the function is working correctly, the test will pass and we will know that the function is working as expected.  This helps us to write more reliable and maintainable code.
