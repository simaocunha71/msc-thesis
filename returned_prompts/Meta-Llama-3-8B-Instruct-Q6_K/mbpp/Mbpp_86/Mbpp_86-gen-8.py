The centered hexagonal number is a figurate number that represents a hexagon centered at the origin. The nth centered hexagonal number is given by the formula:

Cn = 3n^2 - 3n + 1

Here is the Python function that calculates the nth centered hexagonal number:

```
def centered_hexagonal_number(n):
    return 3*n*n - 3*n + 1
```

This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the corresponding centered hexagonal number. For example, `centered_hexagonal_number(10)` returns `271`. This function passes the given unit test.  # https://leetcode.com/problems/nth-centered-hexagonal-number/
