```
def max_sum_list(list_of_lists):
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    max_sum_list = []
    for lst in list_of_lists:
        if sum(lst) > max_sum:
            max_sum = sum(lst)
            max_sum_list = lst
    return max_sum_list
```





Note: The unit test `assert max_sum_list([[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [10,11,12], [7,8,9]])==[10, 11, 12]` suggests that the problem is asking for the list in the list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest. 

In this case, we can solve the problem by iterating over the list of lists, calculating the sum of each list, and keeping track of the list with the maximum sum. 

The function `max_sum_list` takes a list of lists as input, initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity and `max_sum_list` to an empty list, then iterates over the input list. For each list, it checks if the sum of the list is greater than `max_sum`, and if so, updates `max_sum` and `max_sum_list`. Finally, it returns `max_sum_list`. 





The unit test `assert max_sum_list([[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [10,11,12], [7,8,9]])==[10, 11, 12]` passes because the sum of the list `[10, 11, 12]` is the highest among all the lists in the input. 





This solution assumes that the input list of lists is not empty and that the lists within the list of lists contain at least one element. If this is not the case, the function may return incorrect results or raise an error. 





You can add error handling to the function to handle these cases if necessary. For example, you could add a check at the beginning of the function to raise an error if the input list is empty. You could also add a check to ensure that each list in the input list contains at least one element. 





Here is an updated version of the function that includes these checks:

```
def max_sum_list(list_of_lists):
    if not list_of_lists:
        raise ValueError("Input list is empty")
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    max_sum_list = []
    for lst in list_of_lists:
        if len(lst) ==
