Python code to check whether a given number can be represented as the difference of two squares or not.

The function dif_Square(n) takes an integer n as input and returns True if n can be represented as the difference of two squares, and False otherwise.

The function iterates over all possible values of i from 1 to the square root of n (inclusive). For each i, it checks if the square of i minus the square root of n minus the square of i is equal to the square of the integer part of the square root of n minus the square of i. If this condition is met, it returns True, indicating that n can be represented as the difference of two squares.

If the function iterates over all possible values of i without finding a match, it returns False, indicating that n cannot be represented as the difference of two squares.

The unit test dif_Square(5) == True confirms that the function works correctly for the input 5, which can be represented as the difference of two squares (25 - 16 = 9).
