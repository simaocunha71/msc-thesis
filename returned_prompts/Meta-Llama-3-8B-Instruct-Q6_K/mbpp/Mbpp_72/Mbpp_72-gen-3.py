This function checks whether the given number can be represented as the difference of two squares or not. It uses two nested loops to iterate through all possible pairs of squares whose difference is equal to the given number. If such a pair is found, the function returns True, indicating that the number can be represented as the difference of two squares. If no such pair is found after checking all possible pairs, the function returns False, indicating that the number cannot be represented as the difference of two squares.

The unit test `assert dif_Square(5) == True` suggests that the function should return True for the input 5, as 5 can be represented as the difference of two squares: 3^2 - 2^2 = 5. The function is designed to work for all positive integers. If the input is not a positive integer, the function may not work correctly.

The time complexity of this function is O(n^(3/2)), where n is the input number. This is because the function uses two nested loops, each of which runs up to the square root of the input number. The space complexity is O(1), as the function uses a constant amount of space to store the loop variables and the result.
