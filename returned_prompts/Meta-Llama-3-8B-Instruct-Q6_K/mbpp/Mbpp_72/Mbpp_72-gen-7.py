This function takes an integer n as input and checks whether it can be represented as the difference of two squares. It iterates through all possible pairs of squares and checks if their difference is equal to the given number. If it finds such a pair, it returns True. If no such pair is found after checking all possibilities, it returns False. The unit test `assert dif_Square(5) == True` suggests that the function should return True for the input 5, which is indeed the difference of two squares (1^2 - 2^2 = 5). 

However, this function is not efficient as it has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested loops. For large inputs, this function may take a long time to complete. A more efficient solution could be to use mathematical properties to reduce the number of iterations, but this would make the function more complex and harder to understand. 

For example, we could use the fact that a perfect square can be expressed as the difference of two squares if and only if it is of the form 4k + 1, where k is a non-negative integer. This would allow us to reduce the number of iterations to O(sqrt(n)), but the function would be more complex and harder to understand. 

Here is the modified function based on the above idea:

```
def dif_Square(n):
    if n < 0:
        return False
    for i in range(int((n + 1) ** 0.5)):
        if (i * i - (n - i * i)) % 4 == 1:
            return True
    return False
```

This function is more efficient than the previous one but still not very efficient for large inputs. A more efficient solution would require a deeper understanding of number theory and algebraic properties of squares. 

For example, we could use the fact that a number can be expressed as the difference of two squares if and only if it is of the form 4k + 1 or 4k + 3, where k is a non-negative integer. This would allow us to reduce the number of iterations to O(sqrt(n)), but the function would be more complex and harder to understand.
