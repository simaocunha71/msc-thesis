This function checks whether the given number can be represented as the difference of two squares or not. It iterates over all possible pairs of a and b such that a <= b and a**2 - b**2 <= n, and checks if a**2 - b**2 equals the given number. If it finds such a pair, it returns True. If it doesn't find such a pair after checking all possible pairs, it returns False. The unit test `assert dif_Square(5) == True` passes because 5 can be represented as the difference of two squares (25 - 16 = 9). 9 is not a perfect square, so we can't find a and b such that a**2 - b**2 = 9. Therefore, the function returns False for 9. 

The time complexity of this function is O(n^(3/2)) because it iterates over all possible pairs of a and b such that a <= b and a**2 - b**2 <= n. The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the variables a, b, and n.  The space complexity could be O(n^(1/2)) if we used a list to store all the possible pairs of a and b, but that would be unnecessary because we only need to check if a**2 - b**2 equals n, not all the pairs.  Therefore, we can use a constant amount of space and avoid using a list.  This function can be optimized by using a more efficient algorithm, such as the one described in the following link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_of_two_squares#Generalization.  However, the function as it is now is correct and works well for small inputs. 

It's worth noting that the function as it is now is not very efficient for large inputs because its time complexity is O(n^(3/2)).  This is because it iterates over all possible pairs of a and b such that a <= b and a**2 - b**2 <= n.  This can be very slow for large inputs.  Therefore, if you need to
