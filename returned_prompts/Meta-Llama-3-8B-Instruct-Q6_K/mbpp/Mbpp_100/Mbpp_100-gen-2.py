```    
    The function `next_smallest_palindrome` adds 1 to the input number `n` and then checks if the resulting number is a palindrome. If it's not, it adds 1 again and checks again, repeating this process until a palindrome is found. The function then returns this palindrome. The helper function `is_palindrome` checks if a given string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse.    
    The unit test `assert next_smallest_palindrome(99)==101` ensures that the function works correctly by checking that the next smallest palindrome of 99 is indeed 101.    
    This solution has a time complexity of O(log n) because it checks palindromes of length log n, and a space complexity of O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space.    
    It should be noted that this solution may not work correctly for very large inputs, as it uses a string to check for palindromes. A more efficient solution for large inputs would be to implement a palindrome check using integer arithmetic.    
    However, the given unit test suggests that the input numbers are relatively small, so the given solution should be sufficient.    
    The solution is also not very efficient for small inputs, as it checks a lot of non-palindromes before finding the next palindrome. A more efficient solution would be to keep track of the last palindrome checked and add 1 to it until a palindrome is found.    
    However, the given solution is simple and easy to understand, and it should be sufficient for the given unit test.    
    It's also worth noting that the function `next_smallest_palindrome` does not check if the input `n` is a palindrome, it will always add 1 to the input and then find the next palindrome. If you want to find the next smallest palindrome of a given palindrome, you should modify the function accordingly.    
    The function `next_smallest_palindrome` also does not handle the case where the input `n` is negative, it will add 1 to the input and then find the next palindrome. If you want to handle the case where the input `n` is negative, you should modify the function accordingly.
