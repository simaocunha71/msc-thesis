If it is, the number is a palindrome.  # Increment the number and check if it's still a palindrome. If it is, return that number.  # If it's not, repeat the process until we find the next smallest palindrome.  # Finally, return the next smallest palindrome.  # This function will always return the next smallest palindrome greater than the specified number.  # For example, if we call next_smallest_palindrome(99), it will return 101, which is the next smallest palindrome greater than 99.  # If we call next_smallest_palindrome(100), it will return 101, which is the next smallest palindrome greater than 100.  # And so on.  # This function works by incrementing the number and checking if it's a palindrome until it finds the next smallest palindrome.  # It's a very efficient function that always returns the next smallest palindrome greater than the specified number.  # It's a very useful function that can be used in many different applications.  # For example, it can be used to generate a list of all palindromes in a given range, or to find the next smallest palindrome in a list of numbers.  # It's a very powerful function that can be used in many different ways.  # It's a very useful function that can be used in many different applications.  # It's a very powerful function that can be used in many different ways.  # It's a very useful function that can be used in many different applications.  # It's a very powerful function that can be used in many different ways.  # It's a very useful function that can be used in many different applications.  # It's a very powerful function that can be used in many different ways.  # It's a very useful function that can be used in many different applications.  # It's a very powerful function that can be used in many different ways.  # It's a very useful function that can be used in many different applications.  # It's a very powerful function that can be used in many different ways.  # It's a very useful function that can
