Explanation:
The problem is asking to find the next smallest palindrome number given a specified integer. For example, the next smallest palindrome of 99 is 101.

We can solve this problem by incrementing the given number by 1 and checking if the incremented number is a palindrome. If it is not a palindrome, we keep incrementing until we find a palindrome.

The `next_smallest_palindrome` function increments the given number by 1 and then checks if the incremented number is a palindrome using the `is_palindrome` function. The `is_palindrome` function checks if the string representation of the number is equal to its reverse.

The unit test `assert next_smallest_palindrome(99)==101` ensures that the function returns the correct result for the input 99. 

This solution assumes that the input is a non-negative integer. If the input can be negative, we need to handle that case separately. Also, if the input is a non-integer, we need to handle that case as well. 

The time complexity of this solution is O(1) because we are not using any complex algorithms or data structures. The space complexity is also O(1) because we are not using any additional space that scales with the input size. 
```python
def next_smallest_palindrome(n):
    n += 1
    while not is_palindrome(str(n)):
        n += 1
    return n

def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]
```    
```
This solution works for the given unit test and should work for most inputs. However, it's worth noting that this solution is not efficient for very large inputs because it increments the number until it finds a palindrome, which can take a long time for large inputs. A more efficient solution would be to generate all palindromes and find the smallest one that is greater than the input. However, this would require a more complex algorithm and data structure. 
```python
def next_smallest_palindrome(n):
    n += 1
    while True:
        if is_palindrome(str(n)):
            return n
        n += 1
```    
```
This solution is more efficient than the previous one because it uses a while loop to increment the
