def tup_string(tup):
    return ''.join(tup).replace('e', '')
```


This function takes a tuple as an argument and returns a string. It uses the `join` method to concatenate all the elements of the tuple into a single string, and then the `replace` method to remove all occurrences of 'e' from the string. 

The unit test `assert tup_string(('e', 'x', 'e', 'r', 'c', 'i', 's', 'e', 's'))==("exercises")` suggests that the function should remove all 'e's from the tuple, so the function is designed accordingly. 

For example, if the input tuple is `('e', 'x', 'e', 'r', 'c', 'i', 's', 'e', 's')`, the function will return the string `"xrsis"`. If the input tuple is `('a', 'b', 'c')`, the function will return the string `"abc"`. If the input tuple is `('e', 'e', 'e')`, the function will return the string `""`. 

The function will work with any tuple, not just those that contain the letter 'e'. It will remove all occurrences of 'e' from the string, regardless of where they appear in the tuple. 

This solution assumes that the tuple contains only strings. If the tuple can contain other types of elements, the function may need to be modified to handle these elements correctly. For example, if the tuple can contain integers, the function may need to convert these integers to strings before concatenating them. 

The function is case-sensitive, so it will treat 'E' and 'e' as different characters. If you want the function to treat 'E' and 'e' as the same character, you can modify the function to convert the string to lowercase or uppercase before removing the 'e's. For example, you could add the line `return ''.join(tup).replace('e', '').lower()` to convert the string to lowercase after removing the 'e's. 

The function does not handle the case where the input tuple is empty. If the input tuple is empty, the function will return an empty string. If you want the function to handle this case differently, you could add a special case to the function. For example, you could add the line `return '' if not tup else ''.join(tup).replace('e', '')` to return
