```
def tup_string(tup):
    return ''.join(tup).replace(' ', '')
```


The provided unit test suggests that the input tuple contains strings and we need to convert it to a single string without any spaces. The function `tup_string` uses the `join` method to concatenate all elements in the tuple into a single string, and then the `replace` method to remove any spaces from the resulting string. 

Here's the breakdown of the function:
- `''.join(tup)` : This line joins all the elements in the tuple into a single string, using an empty string as the separator. This effectively concatenates the elements without adding any characters in between.
- `.replace(' ', '')` : This line removes any spaces from the resulting string. This is because the problem statement says we don't want any spaces in the final string. 

The function `tup_string` returns the resulting string after removing spaces. This is demonstrated in the provided unit test, where the input tuple `('e', 'x', 'e', 'r', 'c', 'i', 's', 'e', 's')` is converted to the string `"exercises"`.
