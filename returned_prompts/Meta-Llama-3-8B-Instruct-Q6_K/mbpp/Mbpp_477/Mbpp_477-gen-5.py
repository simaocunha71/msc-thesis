```
def is_lower(s):
    return s.lower()
```
This problem is asking you to create a function that takes a string as input and returns the same string but in lowercase. 

The unit test provided, `assert is_lower("InValid") == "invalid"`, suggests that the function should be able to convert a string to lowercase. 

The `lower()` method in Python is used to convert a string to lowercase. So, the solution is to simply call the `lower()` method on the input string. 

Here's how you can do it:
```
def is_lower(s):
    return s.lower()
```
This function takes a string `s` as input, and returns the same string but in lowercase. The `lower()` method is a built-in method in Python that converts a string to lowercase. 

For example, if you call `is_lower("InValid")`, it will return `"invalid"`.
