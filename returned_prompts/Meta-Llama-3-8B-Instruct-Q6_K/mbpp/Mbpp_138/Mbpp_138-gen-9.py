This function works by first generating all the powers of 2 that are less than or equal to the given number. Then it checks whether the given number can be represented as the sum of these powers of 2. If it can, it returns True, otherwise False. 

The unit test `assert is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(10) == True` is passed because 10 can be represented as the sum of powers of 2 (2 + 8). 

However, the function does not handle the case where the input number is 0. According to the problem statement, the function should return False for 0 because 0 cannot be represented as the sum of non-zero powers of 2. The function is currently returning True for 0 because the while loop is not terminated when n becomes 0. This can be fixed by adding a condition to return False when n becomes 0. 

The function also does not handle the case where the input number is negative. According to the problem statement, the function should return False for negative numbers because negative numbers cannot be represented as the sum of non-zero powers of 2. The function is currently not handling negative numbers correctly. This can be fixed by adding a condition to return False when the input number is negative. 

The function can be further optimized by using a more efficient algorithm to check whether the given number can be represented as the sum of non-zero powers of 2. For example, the function can use a loop to generate the powers of 2 and then use a loop to check whether the given number can be represented as the sum of these powers of 2. This can reduce the time complexity of the function from O(n) to O(log n). 

Here is the optimized function:

```
def is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return False
    i = 0
