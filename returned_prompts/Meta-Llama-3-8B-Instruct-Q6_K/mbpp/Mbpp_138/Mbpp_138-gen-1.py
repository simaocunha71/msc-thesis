The unit test `assert is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(10) == True` suggests that the function should return True for the input 10, which can be represented as the sum of non-zero powers of 2 (10 = 8 + 2). 

The function `is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two` checks whether the given number `n` can be represented as the sum of non-zero powers of 2. It uses a list comprehension to generate all powers of 2 from the largest power to the smallest, then iterates over these powers to see if `n` can be represented as their sum. If `n` becomes 0 at any point during this iteration, the function returns True, indicating that `n` can be represented as the sum of non-zero powers of 2. If `n` never becomes 0, the function returns False, indicating that `n` cannot be represented as the sum of non-zero powers of 2.

Note that the function returns False for inputs less than or equal to 0, as these cannot be represented as the sum of non-zero powers of 2. This is consistent with the unit test, which does not check the function's behavior for these inputs. 

The time complexity of this function is O(log n), as it iterates over the powers of 2 up to the bit length of `n`. The space complexity is O(log n), as it stores these powers in a list.
