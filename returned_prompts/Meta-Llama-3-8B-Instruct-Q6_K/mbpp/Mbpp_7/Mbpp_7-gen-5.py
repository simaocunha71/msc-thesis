def find_char_long(s):
    words = s.split()
    return [word for word in words if len(word) >= 4]
```


The function `find_char_long` takes a string `s` as input, splits it into words using the `split` method, and then uses a list comprehension to create a list of words that have a length of at least 4 characters. The `set` function is used to convert the list to a set, which removes duplicates. The `assert` statement checks that the set of words found by the function matches the expected result. 

For example, if the input string is `'Please move back to stream'`, the function would return the set `{'Please', 'move', 'back', 'stream'}`. 

The unit test `assert set(find_char_long('Please move back to stream')) == set(['Please', 'move', 'back', 'stream'])` checks that the function returns the correct set of words. 

Note that the `split` method splits the string into words based on whitespace characters, so words separated by commas, semicolons, etc. are treated as separate words. If you want to split the string based on a different character, you can pass that character to the `split` method. For example, `s.split(',')` would split the string into words based on commas.  If you want to split the string based on multiple characters, you can pass a tuple of characters to the `split` method. For example, `s.split((',', '.'))` would split the string into words based on commas and periods.  If you want to split the string based on a regular expression, you can use the `re` module. For example, `import re; s.split(re.compile(',|.'))` would split the string into words based on commas and periods.  If you want to split the string based on a pattern, you can use the `re` module and the `split` method. For example, `import re; s.split(re.compile(r'[,|.]'))` would split the string into words based on commas and periods.  If you want to split the string based on a pattern, you can use the `re` module and the `findall` method. For example, `import re; re.findall(r'[\w\s]+', s)` would split the string into words based on whitespace characters.  If you want to split the string based on a pattern, you
