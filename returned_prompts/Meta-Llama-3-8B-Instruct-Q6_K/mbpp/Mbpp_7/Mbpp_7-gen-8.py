def find_char_long(s):
    return set(word for word in s.split() if len(word) >= 4)
```


Explanation:
The problem is asking to write a function that finds all words in a given string that are at least 4 characters long. The function should return these words as a set.

The unit test provided, `assert set(find_char_long('Please move back to stream')) == set(['Please', 'move', 'back', 'stream'])`, helps in understanding the problem. It shows that the function should return a set of all words in the string that have at least 4 characters.

The solution uses a generator expression within a set comprehension to iterate over the words in the string. It splits the string into words using the `split` method, then filters the words based on their length using the `if` condition `len(word) >= 4`. The resulting set of words is then returned. 

The `assert` statement in the unit test checks if the returned set is equal to the expected set of words. This ensures that the function is working correctly. 

Note: The `split` method without any arguments splits the string into words based on whitespace characters. This is sufficient for most use cases, but it may not work correctly if the string contains non-breaking spaces or other non-whitespace characters that should be treated as word separators. In such cases, a more sophisticated method of word separation may be needed.
