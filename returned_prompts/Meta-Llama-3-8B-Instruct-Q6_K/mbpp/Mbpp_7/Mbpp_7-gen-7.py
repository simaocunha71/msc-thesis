def find_char_long(s):
    words = s.split()
    return [word for word in words if len(word) >= 4]
```
The provided unit test suggests that we need to find all words in the string that are at least 4 characters long. We can achieve this by splitting the string into words using the `split` method, and then using a list comprehension to filter out the words that are less than 4 characters long. The result is a list of words that meet the condition.

The unit test `assert set(find_char_long('Please move back to stream')) == set(['Please', 'move', 'back', 'stream'])` ensures that the function is working correctly. It checks that the output of the function is a set of the expected words. The `set` function is used to convert the list to a set, which removes any duplicates and allows for a more efficient comparison. The `assert` statement checks that the set returned by the function is equal to the expected set. If the sets are not equal, the `assert` statement will raise an `AssertionError`. This ensures that the function is working correctly and that the expected output is returned.
