```
def find_char_long(s):
    words = s.split()
    return [word for word in words if len(word) >= 4]
```


The problem is asking for a function that can find all the words in a given string that are at least 4 characters long. 

The unit test `assert set(find_char_long('Please move back to stream')) == set(['Please', 'move', 'back', 'stream'])` helps to clarify the problem. It shows that the function should return a list of words from the string that have a length of 4 or more.

Here is a Python solution for the problem:

```
def find_char_long(s):
    words = s.split()
    return [word for word in words if len(word) >= 4]
```

This function works by first splitting the input string `s` into a list of words using the `split` method. Then, it uses a list comprehension to create a new list that only includes the words from the original list that have a length of 4 or more. The resulting list is then returned by the function. 

For example, if you call `find_char_long('Please move back to stream')`, the function will return `['Please', 'move', 'back', 'stream']`, which are the words from the input string that have a length of 4 or more.
