```
def find_char_long(s):
    words = s.split()
    return set(word for word in words if len(word) >= 4)
```





The problem is asking to write a function that takes a string as input and returns a set of words that are at least 4 characters long.

The given unit test suggests that the function should split the input string into words and then filter the words based on their length.

Here is a Python solution for the problem:

```
def find_char_long(s):
    words = s.split()
    return set(word for word in words if len(word) >= 4)
```

This function uses the `split` method to split the input string into words. Then, it uses a generator expression to filter the words based on their length. The `set` function is used to convert the filtered words into a set, which automatically removes duplicates. The function then returns the set of words that are at least 4 characters long.
