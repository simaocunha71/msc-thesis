This problem is asking to reverse the vowels in a given string. However, the problem statement doesn't specify whether 'y' should be considered as a vowel or not. 

Thanks to the unit test `assert reverse_vowels("Python") == "Python"`, we can assume that 'y' is not a vowel and only the standard English vowels 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' and their uppercase counterparts are to be reversed. 

The function works by iterating over the string from both ends, swapping the vowels it finds, until the pointers meet in the middle. The function returns the modified string. 

Note that the function does not modify the string if it does not contain any vowels, as the problem statement does not specify what to do in such a case. However, the unit test `assert reverse_vowels("Python") == "Python"` implies that the function should return the original string in such a case.
