The problem asks to write a function that reverses only the vowels of a given string. However, the problem statement seems to be missing a crucial detail, which is that 'y' should not be considered a vowel. This is evident from the unit test provided, which asserts that the function should return the original string "Python" when given the input "Python".

Here is a Python function that solves the problem:

```python
def reverse_vowels(s):
    vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'
    s = list(s)
    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
    while left < right:
        if s[left] not in vowels:
            left += 1
        elif s[right] not in vowels:
            right -= 1
        else:
            s[left], s[right] = s[right], s[left]
            left, right = left + 1, right - 1
    return ''.join(s)
```

This function converts the input string into a list of characters, and then uses two pointers, `left` and `right`, to traverse the list from both ends. It checks if the characters at the `left` and `right` indices are vowels, and if they are not, it moves the pointers accordingly. If both characters are vowels, it swaps them and moves the pointers. Finally, it converts the list back into a string and returns it. The function works correctly even if 'y' is not a vowel, as evident from the unit test.
