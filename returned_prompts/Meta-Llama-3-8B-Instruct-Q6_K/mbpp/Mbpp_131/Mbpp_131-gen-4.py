Explanation:
This function takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string where only the vowels are reversed. It works by maintaining two pointers, `left` and `right`, that start from the beginning and end of the string respectively. It iterates through the string until `left` meets `right` in the middle. If the character at `left` or `right` is not a vowel, it moves the corresponding pointer. If both characters are vowels, it swaps them and moves both pointers. The function finally returns the modified string.

The unit test `assert reverse_vowels("Python") == "Python"` is correct because "Python" does not contain any vowels. The function should not modify the input string in this case. 





This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because it iterates through the string once. The space complexity is O(n) as well, because it creates a new string to store the result. The function is also case-insensitive, as it converts the characters to lowercase before checking if they are vowels. The function also ignores the character 'y' as it is not considered a vowel in this problem. 





The function uses the `lower()` method to convert the characters to lowercase, which ensures that the function works correctly even if the input string contains uppercase vowels. The `in` operator is used to check if a character is a vowel, which is a more efficient way to do this than using a series of `if` statements. The `join()` method is used to concatenate the characters in the list back into a string.
