Explanation:
The problem is asking to count the number of indices where the lists have the same values.

In the first solution, we iterate over the indices of the lists and check if the elements at the current index are equal. If they are, we increment the count.

In the second solution, we use the built-in `zip` function to pair the elements of the two lists. Then, we use a generator expression to count the number of pairs where the elements are equal. The `sum` function is used to calculate the total count. This solution is more concise and efficient than the first one.
