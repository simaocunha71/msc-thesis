```
def count_same_pair(list1, list2):
    return sum(1 for a, b in zip(list1, list2) if a == b)
```


The function `count_same_pair` takes two lists `list1` and `list2` as input and returns the count of indices where the lists have the same values. It uses the built-in `zip` function to iterate over the two lists in parallel, and the `sum` function with a generator expression to count the number of indices where the values are the same. The unit test `assert count_same_pair([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8],[2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 6, 7, 9])==4` shows that the function should return 4 for the given lists.  This function is case-sensitive, meaning it treats 'a' and 'A' as different values. If you want it to be case-insensitive, you can convert the lists to lower case or upper case before comparing. For example, you can use the `map` function and `str.lower` or `str.upper` method to convert the strings to lower case or upper case before comparing. 

Here is the modified function that is case-insensitive:

```
def count_same_pair(list1, list2):
    return sum(1 for a, b in zip(map(str.lower, list1), map(str.lower, list2)) if a == b)
```


This function will return the correct count even if the lists contain strings with different cases. For example, it will treat 'a' and 'A' as the same value.  If you want to compare integers, you don't need to convert them to strings. The function will work correctly with integers as is.  If you want to compare other types of values, you may need to convert them to a common type before comparing.  For example, if you want to compare dates, you may need to convert them to strings or timestamps before comparing.  The specifics will depend on the types of values you are working with and how you want to compare them.  In general, it's a good idea to think about how you want to compare values and what types of values you will be working with when writing a function like this.  This will help you write a function that is clear, concise, and easy to understand.  It will also help you avoid
