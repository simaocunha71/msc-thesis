```
def count_same_pair(list1, list2):
    return sum(1 for x, y in zip(list1, list2) if x == y)
```


The function `count_same_pair` takes two lists as input and returns the count of indices where the lists have the same values. It uses the built-in `zip` function to iterate over the two lists in parallel, and the `sum` function with a generator expression to count the number of indices where the values are the same. The `zip` function stops iterating once the end of the shorter list is reached, so the function works correctly even if the lists are of different lengths. 

For example, when called with the input `count_same_pair([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8],[2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 6, 7, 9])`, the function returns `4`, which is the correct count of indices where the lists have the same values. 





This problem can be solved by using a simple for loop to iterate over the lists and a counter to count the number of times the values at the same index are the same.
