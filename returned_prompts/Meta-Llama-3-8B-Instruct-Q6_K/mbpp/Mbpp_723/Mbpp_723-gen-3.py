```
def count_same_pair(list1, list2):
    return sum(1 for a, b in zip(list1, list2) if a == b)
```


Explanation:
The problem is asking to write a function that takes two lists of the same length as input and returns the count of indices where the lists have the same values. 

The provided unit test `assert count_same_pair([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8],[2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 6, 7, 9])==4` suggests that the function should count the number of pairs where the corresponding elements in the two lists are the same.

The solution uses the built-in `zip` function to iterate over the pairs of elements from the two lists. The `sum` function is then used with a generator expression to count the number of pairs where the corresponding elements are the same. The `if a == b` condition in the generator expression filters out the pairs where the elements are not the same, and the `sum` function counts the number of pairs that satisfy this condition. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input lists, because it iterates over the pairs of elements in the lists once. The space complexity is O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the temporary results.
