This function iterates through the list and keeps track of the maximum sum of a sublist found so far. If the current sum becomes negative, it resets the current sum to 0 and starts a new sublist from the current position. It keeps track of the start and end indices of the maximum sublist and returns its sum. The function also handles the case where the list contains negative numbers and the maximum sum is negative. 

The unit test `assert max_sub_array_sum([-2, -3, 4, -1, -2, 1, 5, -3], 8) == 7` ensures that the function works correctly for lists with negative numbers and returns the correct sum. 

The function also takes an additional parameter `n`, which is the length of the list. This is necessary because the function is designed to work with lists of any length, not just lists of a specific length. 

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the list, because it iterates through the list once. The space complexity is O(1), because it uses a constant amount of space to store the maximum sum, current sum, start index, end index, and temporary start index.
