The problem is asking you to find the sum of the largest contiguous sublist in the given list. However, it seems like there's an additional requirement that the sum should not exceed a certain threshold, which is not clearly specified in the problem statement. 

Fortunately, the unit test `assert max_sub_array_sum([-2, -3, 4, -1, -2, 1, 5, -3], 8) == 7` provides a hint about how to approach this problem. It seems like the goal is to find the sum of the largest contiguous sublist that has a length of at most k. If there are multiple such sublists with the same maximum sum, any one of them can be returned.

Here's a Python solution that uses a sliding window approach to solve this problem:

```
def max_sub_array_sum(arr, k):
    if len(arr) < k:
        return 0
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    window_sum = 0
    window_start = 0
    for window_end in range(len(arr)):
        window_sum += arr[window_end]
        if window_end >= k - 1:
            max_sum = max(max_sum, window_sum)
            window_sum -= arr[window_start]
            window_start += 1
    return max_sum
```

This function initializes two variables, `max_sum` and `window_sum`, to keep track of the maximum sum of a sublist and the sum of the current window, respectively. It then iterates over the array, updating `window_sum` as it goes and checking if the window has reached a size of `k`. If it has, it updates `max_sum` and then slides the window to the right by subtracting the first element of the window and adding the next element. The function returns the maximum sum found. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array, because it makes a single pass over
