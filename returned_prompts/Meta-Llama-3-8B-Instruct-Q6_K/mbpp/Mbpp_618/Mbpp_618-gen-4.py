```
def div_list(list1, list2):
    return [a/b for a, b in zip(list1, list2)]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to divide corresponding elements of the two input lists. The zip function is used to pair up the elements of the two lists, and the division is done in the list comprehension.

The unit test `assert div_list([4,5,6],[1, 2, 3])==[4.0,2.5,2.0]` ensures that the function works correctly. It checks that the function divides the elements of the first list by the elements of the second list and returns the results as a new list. 

Note: The division operation is performed as floating point division (i.e., it returns a float result). If you want to perform integer division (i.e., it returns an integer result), you can modify the function to use the // operator instead of /. For example:
```
def div_list(list1, list2):
    return [a//b for a, b in zip(list1, list2)]
```  # integer division
```
This will return a list of integers, where each element is the integer division of the corresponding elements in the input lists.  # integer division
