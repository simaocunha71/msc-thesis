You can use the built-in function `min` along with a generator expression to find the minimum product from the pairs of tuples within a given list. Here is how you can do it:

```Python
def min_product_tuple(lst):
    return min(x*y for x, y in lst)
```

This function works by iterating over each tuple in the list, multiplying the two elements together, and then finding the smallest of these products. The `min` function returns the smallest item in an iterable or the smallest of two or more arguments.

For example, if you call `min_product_tuple([(2, 7), (2, 6), (1, 8), (4, 9)])`, it will return `8`, which is the minimum product among the pairs `(2, 7)`, `(2, 6)`, `(1, 8)`, and `(4, 9)`. 

Note: The unit test `assert min_product_tuple([(2, 7), (2, 6), (1, 8), (4, 9)] )==8` ensures that the function is working correctly. It checks if the minimum product from the pairs of tuples `[(2, 7), (2, 6), (1, 8), (4, 9)]` is `8`, which is the correct result. If the function is working correctly, the unit test will pass. If the function is not working correctly, the unit test will fail, indicating that there is a bug in the function.
