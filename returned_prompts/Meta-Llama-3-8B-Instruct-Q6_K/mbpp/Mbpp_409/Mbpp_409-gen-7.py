```
def min_product_tuple(lst):
    return min(a * b for a, b in lst)
```


This function takes a list of tuples as input, where each tuple contains two numbers. It returns the minimum product of the pairs of numbers within the list. The unit test provided ensures that the function works correctly. For example, if the input list is [(2, 7), (2, 6), (1, 8), (4, 9)], the function returns 8, which is the minimum product of the pairs (2, 6) and (1, 8). 

The function uses a generator expression to calculate the product of each pair of numbers in the list, and then returns the minimum of these products using the built-in min function. This approach is efficient and easy to read, making it a good solution for this problem. 





```
import unittest

class TestMinProductTuple(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_min_product_tuple(self):
        self.assertEqual(min_product_tuple([(2, 7), (2, 6), (1, 8), (4, 9)]), 8)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```


The test case checks if the function min_product_tuple returns the correct minimum product when given the input [(2, 7), (2, 6), (1, 8), (4, 9)]. The expected output is 8, which is the minimum product of the pairs (2, 6) and (1, 8). If the function returns the correct minimum product, the test case will pass; otherwise, it will fail.
