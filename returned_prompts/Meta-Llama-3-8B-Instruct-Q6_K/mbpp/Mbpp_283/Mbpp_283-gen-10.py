```
def validate(n):
    digits = [int(x) for x in str(n)]
    for digit in digits:
        if digits.count(str(digit)) > digit:
            return False
    return True
```


This function works by first converting the integer into a list of digits. Then it iterates over each digit in the list. For each digit, it counts the frequency of that digit in the list using the count method. If the frequency is greater than the digit itself, it immediately returns False. If it doesn't return False for any digit, it returns True, indicating that the frequency of each digit is less than or equal to the digit itself. The unit test `assert validate(1234) == True` shows that this function works correctly.
