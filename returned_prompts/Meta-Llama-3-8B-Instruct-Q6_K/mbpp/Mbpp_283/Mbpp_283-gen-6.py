```
def validate(n):
    str_n = str(n)
    for digit in set(str_n):
        if str_n.count(digit) > int(digit):
            return False
    return True
```


This function converts the integer to a string, then iterates over each unique digit in the string. For each digit, it counts the frequency of the digit in the string and checks if it is less than or equal to the digit itself. If it finds a digit with a frequency greater than itself, it returns False. If it doesn't find any such digit, it returns True. 

The unit test `assert validate(1234) == True` suggests that the function should return True for the input 1234, which means that for each digit in the number, the frequency of that digit is less than or equal to the digit itself. 

This function passes the given unit test.
