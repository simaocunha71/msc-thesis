```
def validate(n):
    n = str(n)
    for digit in n:
        if int(digit) > 0 and n.count(digit) > int(digit):
            return False
    return True
```
This function works by first converting the integer into a string. Then it iterates over each character (digit) in the string. For each digit, it checks if the count of that digit in the string is greater than the digit itself. If it finds a digit that has a frequency greater than the digit itself, it immediately returns False. If it doesn't find any such digit, it returns True after checking all digits. 

The unit test `assert validate(1234) == True` suggests that the function should return True for the input 1234 because the frequency of each digit is less than or equal to the digit itself. 

The unit test `assert validate(1214) == False` suggests that the function should return False for the input 1214 because the frequency of the digit 1 is greater than the digit 1 itself.
