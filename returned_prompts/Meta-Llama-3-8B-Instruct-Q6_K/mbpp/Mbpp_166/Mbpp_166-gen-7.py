```
def find_even_pair(lst):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):
            if (lst[i] ^ lst[j]) % 2 == 0:
                count += 1
    return count
```


The problem asks you to write a function that counts the number of pairs of integers in a list that XOR (bitwise exclusive OR) to an even number. 

The unit test `assert find_even_pair([5, 4, 7, 2, 1]) == 4` suggests that the function should count the number of pairs of integers in the list that XOR to an even number.

Here's a Python solution using two nested loops to iterate over the list and check each pair of integers:

```
def find_even_pair(lst):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):
            if (lst[i] ^ lst[j]) % 2 == 0:
                count += 1
    return count
```

This function works by iterating over the list and checking each pair of integers. For each pair, it calculates the XOR of the two integers and checks if the result is even (i.e., the remainder when divided by 2 is 0). If the result is even, it increments the count. Finally, it returns the total count.
