```
def find_Parity(n):
    return bin(n).count('1') % 2 != 0
```


The function takes an integer `n` as an argument and returns a boolean value indicating whether the parity of `n` is odd. 

The parity of a number is defined as the remainder when the number is divided by 2. 

The function works by converting the number to binary using the `bin` function, and then counting the number of 1s in the binary representation using the `count` method. 

The parity is considered odd if the count of 1s is odd, which is equivalent to the remainder when the count is divided by 2 being non-zero. 

The function returns `True` if the parity is odd, and `False` otherwise. 

The unit test `assert find_Parity(12) == False` ensures that the function returns the correct result for the input 12, which has an even parity. 

This function works for any positive integer input. 

Note that this function does not handle non-integer inputs or negative integers. 

For example, it would return incorrect results for inputs like 3.14 or -5. 

To handle these cases, you would need to add additional error checking code. 

For example, you could use a try-except block to catch and handle ValueError exceptions that occur when bin(n) is called with a non-integer input. 

You could also use the abs function to ensure that the input is a positive integer. 

Here is an example of how you could modify the function to handle these cases:

```
def find_Parity(n):
    try:
        n = int(n)
        if n < 0:
            n = abs(n)
        return bin(n).count('1') % 2 != 0
    except ValueError:
        return "Input must be a positive integer"
```


This modified function will return an error message if the input is not a positive integer, rather than attempting to calculate the parity of the input. 

It will also correctly handle non-integer inputs by returning an error message, rather than attempting to convert them to integers. 

This is just one way to handle these cases, and you may need to modify the function further depending on your specific requirements. 

For example, you might want to add additional error checking code to handle other types of invalid input, or to handle invalid input in a different way. 

You might also want to add documentation to the function to
