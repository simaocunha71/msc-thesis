"""
The problem is asking for a function that determines whether the parity of a given number is odd or not. 

The parity of a number is the remainder when the number is divided by 2. If the remainder is 0, the parity is even, otherwise it is odd.

The unit test `assert find_Parity(12) == False` suggests that the function should return False for even numbers and True for odd numbers.

Here is a Python function that solves the problem:

```
def find_Parity(n):
    return n % 2 != 0
```
This function returns True if the remainder of `n` divided by 2 is not 0 (i.e., the number is odd), and False otherwise. 

For example, `find_Parity(12)` returns False because 12 is even, and `find_Parity(13)` returns True because 13 is odd.
