def find_Parity(n):
    return n % 2 != 0
```
The problem is asking to write a function that determines if the parity of a given number is odd. The parity of a number is odd if the number itself is odd. 

The unit test `assert find_Parity(12) == False` suggests that the function should return `False` for even numbers and `True` for odd numbers.

Here is the solution in Python. The function uses the modulus operator `%` to find the remainder of the division of the number by 2. If the remainder is not 0, the number is odd, and the function returns `True`. If the remainder is 0, the number is even, and the function returns `False`.  This approach is efficient and straightforward.  The unit test `assert find_Parity(12) == False` will pass with this implementation.  



Here's how it works:

- `n % 2` calculates the remainder of the division of `n` by 2. 
- If `n` is even, `n % 2` will be 0, and `n % 2 != 0` will be `False`.
- If `n` is odd, `n % 2` will be 1, and `n % 2 != 0` will be `True`.
- The function returns `n % 2 != 0`, which is `True` for odd numbers and `False` for even numbers.  



This function can be used to determine the parity of any integer. For example, `find_Parity(12)` will return `False` because 12 is even, and `find_Parity(13)` will return `True` because 13 is odd.   



This function is efficient because it only requires a single operation to determine the parity of a number. It is also easy to understand and use.   



The unit test `assert find_Parity(12) == False` confirms that the function behaves correctly for even numbers. The function returns `False` for even numbers, as expected.   



The function can be used in a variety of applications, such as checking whether a number is odd or even, or determining whether a number is a power of 2.   



In summary, this function is a simple and efficient way to determine the parity of a number in Python. It is easy to use and understand, and it can be used in a variety
