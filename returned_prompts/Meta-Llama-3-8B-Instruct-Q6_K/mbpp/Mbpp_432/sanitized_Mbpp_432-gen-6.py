def median_trapezium(a, b, c):
    return sorted([a, b])[1]  # Assuming the sides are a, b, and c, where a and b are the parallel sides. The median is the middle value of the two parallel sides. If the two parallel sides are equal, the median is the average of the two parallel sides. If the two parallel sides are not equal, the median is the middle value of the two parallel sides. This function works under the assumption that the sides are a, b, and c, where a and b are the parallel sides.
