Note: The function takes three numbers as input, sorts them in ascending order, and then returns the median. If the length of the list is even, it returns the average of the two middle numbers. If the length of the list is odd, it returns the middle number. The unit test `assert median_numbers(25,55,65)==55.0` ensures that the function works correctly. 
This solution assumes that the input is a list of three numbers. If the input is not a list of three numbers, the function will not work correctly. The unit test `assert median_numbers(25,55,65)==55.0` ensures that the function works correctly for the given input. 
The median of three numbers is the middle value when the numbers are sorted in ascending order. If the length of the list is even, the median is the average of the two middle values. If the length of the list is odd, the median is the middle value. The function uses the sorted list to find the median. 
The function returns the median as a floating point number. This is because the median can be a decimal value. For example, the median of the numbers 1, 2, and 3 is 2.0, not 2. The function returns the median as a floating point number to ensure that the result is accurate for all possible inputs. 
The function does not handle invalid input. If the input is not a list of three numbers, the function will not work correctly. The unit test `assert median_numbers(25,55,65)==55.0` ensures that the function works correctly for the given input. 
The function uses the `sorted` function to sort the list of numbers. This function returns a new sorted list from the elements of any sequence. The `sorted` function is a built-in function in Python. 
The function uses the `len` function to get the length of the list. This function returns the number of items in an object. The `len` function is a built-in function in Python. 
The function uses the `//` operator to perform integer division. This operator returns the integer part of the result
