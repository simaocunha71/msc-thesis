```
def median_numbers(a, b, c):
    numbers = sorted([a, b, c])
    return numbers[1]
```


The median is the middle value in a sorted list of numbers. If there are three numbers, the middle value is the second number in the sorted list. 

The unit test `assert median_numbers(25,55,65)==55.0` ensures that the function returns the correct median for the given set of numbers. 

In this function, we first sort the list of numbers. Then we return the second number in the sorted list, which is the median. 

For example, if the input is 25, 55, 65, the function will return 55, which is the median. 

The function will work correctly for any set of three numbers, not just the ones in the unit test.  It will always return the median of the three numbers. 

The unit test is important because it ensures that the function works correctly for a specific set of inputs. This is important for testing the function and making sure it works as expected. 

Without the unit test, we might not know if the function is working correctly. The unit test gives us confidence that the function is working as expected.  It also helps us catch any errors or bugs in the function. 

If the function is not working correctly, the unit test will fail, and we will know that there is a problem with the function.  This makes it easier to debug the function and fix any errors. 

So, the unit test is an important part of the function, and it helps us ensure that the function is working correctly. 

The function is also easy to understand and use. It takes three numbers as input and returns the median of those numbers. 

It is also efficient, because it only needs to sort the numbers once, and then it can return the median. 

This makes the function useful for a wide range of applications, and it is a good example of how to write a function that is easy to use and understand. 

In summary, the function is easy to use and understand, and it is efficient and works correctly for any set of three numbers. The unit test ensures that the function is working correctly, and it helps us catch any errors or bugs in the function. 

This makes the function a good example of how to write a function that is easy to use and understand, and it is a good tool to have in your toolkit. 

The function is also a good example of
