```
def min_of_three(a, b, c):
    return min(a, b, c)
```


This function takes three numbers as input and returns the smallest one. The unit test `assert min_of_three(10,20,0)==0` suggests that the function should return the smallest number among the three. The built-in `min` function in Python can be used to find the minimum of three numbers, so the solution is straightforward.
