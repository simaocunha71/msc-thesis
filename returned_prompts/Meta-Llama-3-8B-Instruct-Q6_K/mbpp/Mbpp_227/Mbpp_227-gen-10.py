```
def min_of_three(a, b, c):
    return min(a, b, c)
```
This function uses the built-in `min` function in Python, which returns the smallest item in an iterable or the smallest of two or more arguments. In this case, it returns the smallest of the three numbers `a`, `b`, and `c`. 

The unit test `assert min_of_three(10,20,0)==0` ensures that the function returns the correct result. 

This function does not need any additional complexity as it can directly use the built-in `min` function. It is also efficient and easy to read.
