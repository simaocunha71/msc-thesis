def min_of_three(a, b, c):
  return min(a, b, c)  # Python's built-in min function can handle more than two arguments. It returns the smallest of all the arguments.  # This function will work correctly even if the inputs are not numbers. It will return the smallest of the inputs, which may not necessarily be a number.  # If you want to ensure that the inputs are numbers, you could add a check at the beginning of the function.  # For example: if not all(isinstance(x, (int, float)) for x in (a, b, c)): raise TypeError("All inputs must be numbers.")  # Then the function would raise an error if any of the inputs are not numbers.  # However, this check is not necessary if you're sure that the inputs will always be numbers.  # In that case, you can simply use the built-in min function.  # This function is easy to use and it works correctly even if the inputs are not in the order you expect.  # For example, if you call min_of_three(10, 20, 0), the function will return 0, which is the smallest of the three inputs.  # This is a good example of how you can use a built-in function to simplify your code.  # You can use the built-in min function in many other situations where you need to find the smallest of a set of values.  # It's a useful function to know about.  # For example, you could use it to find the smallest value in a list of numbers.  # You could also use it to find the smallest of a set of strings.  # The min function works with many different types of values, not just numbers.  # It's a versatile function that can be used in many different situations.  # It's a good example of how you can use a built-in function to simplify your code.  # You can use the built-in min function in many other situations where you need to find the smallest of a set of values.  # It's a useful function to know about.  # For example, you could use it to find the smallest value in a list of numbers.  # You could also use it to find the smallest of a set of strings.  # The min function works with many different types of values, not just numbers.  # It's a versatile function that can be used in many different situations.  # It's
