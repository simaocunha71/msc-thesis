def min_of_three(a, b, c):
    return min(a, b, c)

# Test the function
print(min_of_three(10,20,0))  # Output: 0

Explanation:
The problem is asking to create a function that takes three numbers as input and returns the smallest one. We can use Python's built-in min() function to achieve this. The min() function returns the smallest item in an iterable or the smallest of two or more arguments. In this case, we pass three arguments to the min() function and it returns the smallest one. The unit test provided ensures that the function works correctly. The test case min_of_three(10,20,0) returns 0, which is the smallest of the three numbers.  This solution is simple and efficient, with a time complexity of O(1) because it doesn't involve any loops or recursion.  It also has a space complexity of O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the function's parameters and return value.  Overall, this solution is a good example of how to use Python's built-in functions to solve a problem efficiently and effectively.  It is also easy to read and understand, making it a good choice for a real-world application.  However, it may not be suitable for all situations, such as when the input numbers are very large or when the function needs to be used in a specific context that requires a different approach.  In such cases, a different solution may be more appropriate.  For example, if the input numbers are very large, a solution that uses a loop or recursion may be more efficient.  If the function needs to be used in a specific context, such as a GUI application, a different solution may be more appropriate.  In general, the choice of solution will depend on the specific requirements of the problem and the context in which it is being used.  It is always important to consider the trade-offs involved in choosing a solution, such as efficiency, readability, and maintainability, and to choose the solution that best meets the requirements of the problem and the context in which it is being used.
