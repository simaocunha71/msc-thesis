```
def min_of_three(a, b, c):
    return min(a,b,c)
```


The problem is asking you to create a function that takes three numbers as input and returns the smallest one. 

The unit test provided, `assert min_of_three(10,20,0)==0`, suggests that the function should be able to find the minimum of three numbers. 

In Python, you can use the built-in `min` function to find the minimum of a list of numbers. So, the solution is quite simple: just return the minimum of the three input numbers. 

Here's the Python code to achieve this:

```
def min_of_three(a, b, c):
    return min(a,b,c)
```


This function takes three arguments `a`, `b`, and `c`, and returns the smallest one. The `min` function in Python returns the smallest item in an iterable or the smallest of two or more arguments. So, when you call `min(a, b, c)`, it returns the smallest of `a`, `b`, and `c`. 

You can test this function with the provided unit test to see that it works as expected. For example, `min_of_three(10, 20, 0)` should return `0`. 

This solution is efficient and easy to understand, and it works for any three numbers, not just the specific numbers provided in the unit test. 

However, it's worth noting that this function does not handle the case where the input numbers are not all numbers (e.g., if one of them is a string). If you need to handle such cases, you may want to add some error checking code to the function. But for the purpose of this problem, the simple `min` function is sufficient.
