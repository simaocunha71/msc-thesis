The function `digit_distance_nums` takes two integers as input and returns the sum of the per-digit difference between them. It first checks if `a` is greater than `b` and swaps them if necessary, so that `a` is always the smaller number. Then it calculates the sum of the digits of `a` and `b` (excluding zeros) and subtracts the sum of the digits of `b` from the sum of the digits of `a`. This gives the sum of the per-digit difference between `a` and `b`. 

The unit test `assert digit_distance_nums(1,2) == 1` ensures that the function returns the correct result for the given input. 

This function assumes that the input integers do not contain leading zeros. If leading zeros are allowed, the function should be modified to handle them correctly. 

The function uses a generator expression to convert the strings of digits to integers, and the built-in `sum` function to calculate the sum of the integers. The `if digit != '0'` condition in the generator expression is used to exclude zeros from the sum. 

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of digits in the input integers, because it needs to iterate over all the digits to calculate the sum. The space complexity is O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the intermediate results.
