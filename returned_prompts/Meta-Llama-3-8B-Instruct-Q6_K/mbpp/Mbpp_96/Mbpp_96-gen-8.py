```
def divisor(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1
    return count
```


The problem is asking for a function that takes an integer as input and returns the number of divisors it has. A divisor is a number that can be divided into the given integer without leaving a remainder.

The given unit test `assert divisor(15) == 4` suggests that the function should return 4 for the input 15 because 15 has the following divisors: 1, 3, 5, and 15.

Here is a simple solution in Python:

```
def divisor(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1
    return count
```

This function iterates over all numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and checks if `n` is divisible by each number. If it is, it increments the count. Finally, it returns the count, which represents the number of divisors of `n`. This solution has a time complexity of O(n).
