    count = 0

The function `divisor(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the number of divisors of `n`. It iterates over all numbers from 1 to `n` and checks if `n` is divisible by each number. If it is, it increments the `count` variable. Finally, it returns the `count` variable. This function is used to test the unit test `assert divisor(15) == 4`. The number of divisors of 15 is indeed 4 (1, 3, 5, 15).  This function works for all positive integers, not just perfect squares. 

However, it's worth noting that this function has a time complexity of O(n) which may not be efficient for large numbers. There are more efficient algorithms to find the number of divisors of a number, such as using the prime factorization of the number.  For example, if the prime factorization of `n` is `p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... * pk^ak`, then the number of divisors of `n` is `(a1 + 1) * (a2 + 1) * ... * (ak + 1)`. This can be computed in O(log n) time.  Here is the optimized function:
```
def divisor(n):
    count = 1
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            count *= 2
    if n > 1:
        count *= 2
    return count
```
This function works by dividing `n` by the smallest prime factor of `n` as many times as possible, and then incrementing the `count` variable by 1 for each prime factor. This process continues until `n` is reduced to 1. The final value of `count` is the number of divisors of `n`. This function has a time complexity of O(log n) and is more efficient than the original function for large numbers.  However, it's worth noting that this function assumes that the input `n` is a positive integer. If `n` can be negative or zero
