```
def frequency_lists(lists):
    frequency_dict = {}
    for lst in lists:
        for num in lst:
            if num in frequency_dict:
                frequency_dict[num] += 1
            else:
                frequency_dict[num] = 1
    return frequency_dict
```





The problem is asking to create a function that takes a list of lists as input and returns a dictionary where the keys are the unique elements from the list of lists and the values are their corresponding frequencies.

The unit test provided is `assert frequency_lists([[1, 2, 3, 2], [4, 5, 6, 2], [7, 8, 9, 5]])=={1: 1, 2: 3, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 2, 6: 1, 7: 1, 8: 1, 9: 1}`.

Here's the solution:

```python
def frequency_lists(lists):
    frequency_dict = {}
    for lst in lists:
        for num in lst:
            if num in frequency_dict:
                frequency_dict[num] += 1
            else:
                frequency_dict[num] = 1
    return frequency_dict
```





This function iterates over each list in the input list of lists. For each list, it iterates over each element. If the element is already in the frequency dictionary, it increments the count by 1. If the element is not in the dictionary, it adds the element to the dictionary with a count of 1. Finally, it returns the frequency dictionary.
