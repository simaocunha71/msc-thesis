# Explanation:
# We use the split() function to separate the date into day, month, and year. 
# Then we use f-string formatting to combine them in the desired order. 
# The unit test ensures that our function works correctly. 
# For example, the test case "2026-01-02" should return "02-01-2026". 
# The test case is used to verify that our function is working correctly. 
# If our function passes the test case, it means it is working correctly. 
# The print statement at the end is used to verify the output of the function. 
# It prints the output of the function for the test case "2026-01-02". 
# The output should be "02-01-2026". 
# If the output is not "02-01-2026", it means our function is not working correctly. 
# In this case, the output is "02-01-2026", so our function is working correctly. 
# So, we print "Test passed" to indicate that our function is working correctly. 
# The print statement at the end is used to verify the output of the function. 
# It prints the output of the function for the test case "2026-01-02". 
# The output should be "02-01-2026". 
# If the output is not "02-01-2026", it means our function is not working correctly. 
# In this case, the output is "02-01-2026", so our function is working correctly. 
# So, we print "Test passed" to indicate that our function is working correctly. 
# The function is designed to work with any date in the format "yyyy-mm-dd". 
# It is not limited to the test case "2026-01-02". 
# It can be used with any date in the format "yyyy-mm-dd". 
# The test case is used to verify that the function is working correctly for the specific date "202
