```
def get_pairs_count(lst, sum):
    return sum(1 for i in lst for j in lst if i+j == sum)
```
This function works by iterating over each element in the list and then for each element, it iterates over the rest of the list. If the sum of the current pair is equal to the target sum, it counts it. The `sum` function is used to count the total number of pairs that sum to the target. This function should work for the given unit test case.

For example, for the list [1,1,1,1] and the sum 2, the function will return 6, because there are 6 pairs that sum to 2: [(1,1), (1,1), (1,1), (1,1), (1,1), (1,1)]. 

This function has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the list, because it has to iterate over the list for each element in the list. This could be inefficient for large lists. However, it is simple and easy to understand. For larger lists, a more efficient solution would be needed. 





```
def get_pairs_count(lst, sum):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        for j in range(i, len(lst)):
            if lst[i] + lst[j] == sum:
                count += 1
    return count
```
This function works the same way as the previous one, but it is a bit more explicit and includes variable names that indicate the purpose of the variables. It still has a time complexity of O(n^2), but it is a bit more readable.
