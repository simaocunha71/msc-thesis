```



The function radian_degree takes one argument deg which is the degree that we want to convert to radians. It multiplies the degree with pi and then divides by 180. This is because there are 180 degrees in a pi radian.

The unit test `assert radian_degree(90)==1.5707963267948966` helps to verify the correctness of this function. It checks if the radian equivalent of 90 degrees is 1.5707963267948966. 

This function will work for any degree and will return the equivalent radian value.  For example, radian_degree(0) will return 0, radian_degree(180) will return 3.14159265359, and so on.  It can be used in various mathematical calculations where radians are required.  For example, trigonometric functions like sin, cos, tan, etc. accept angles in radians.  So, this function can be used to convert degrees to radians before using them in these functions.  It can also be used in other calculations where radians are required.  For example, in calculating arc lengths and areas of sectors and segments of circles.  It can also be used in calculating distances and angles in spherical and cylindrical coordinates.  It is a very useful function in mathematics and can be used in many different contexts.  It can be used in Python, Java, C++, and many other programming languages.  It is a simple function that can be implemented in any language that supports mathematical operations.
