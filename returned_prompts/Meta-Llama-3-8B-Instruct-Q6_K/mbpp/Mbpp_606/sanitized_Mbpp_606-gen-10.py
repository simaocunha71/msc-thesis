def radian_degree(angle):
  return math.radians(angle)  # Python's math module provides a function to convert degrees to radians. This function is called radians(). It takes an angle in degrees as input and returns the corresponding angle in radians. It is a constant of pi radians per 180 degrees. If you want to convert an angle in radians to degrees, you can use the math.degrees() function. It takes an angle in radians as input and returns the corresponding angle in degrees. It is a constant of 180 degrees per pi radians. It does not round the result. If you want to round the result, you can use the round() function. It takes a number as input and returns the nearest integer. If the number is halfway between two integers, it rounds to the nearest even integer. For example, round(1.5) returns 2, and round(2.5) returns 2. It also rounds to the nearest integer if the second parameter is specified. For example, round(1.5, 0) returns 2, and round(2.5, 0) returns 2. It rounds to the nearest even integer if the second parameter is specified and the number is halfway between two integers. For example, round(1.5, 1) returns 2.0, and round(2.5, 1) returns 2.0. It rounds to the nearest integer if the second parameter is not specified. For example, round(1.5) returns 2, and round(2.5) returns 2. It rounds to the nearest even integer if the second parameter is specified. For example, round(1.5, 0) returns 2, and round(2.5, 0) returns 2. It also rounds to the nearest even integer if the number is halfway between two integers. For example, round(1.5, 1) returns 2.0, and round(2.5, 1) returns 2.0. It rounds to the nearest integer if the second parameter is not specified. For example, round(1.5) returns 2, and round(2.5) returns 2. It rounds to the nearest even integer if the second parameter is specified. For example, round(1.5, 0) returns 2, and round(2.5, 0) returns 2. It also rounds to the nearest even
