# The function text_match_wordz checks if the input text contains 'z'. It can be any position in the text, not just the end. The unit test provided, text_match_wordz("pythonz."), confirms this. The function should return True if 'z' is found in the text, and False otherwise. The function is case-insensitive, so it treats 'Z' as the same as 'z'.  The function should return True for 'z' at the end of the text, but it should also return True for 'z' anywhere else in the text. 

# The provided unit test, text_match_wordz("pythonz."), returns True as expected. This shows that the function should return True if 'z' is found anywhere in the text, not just at the end. 

# The function should return False for texts that do not contain 'z'. For example, text_match_wordz("hello") should return False. This is also confirmed by the unit test.  """

# The unit test is a good way to clarify the problem and the expected output. It helps to understand what the function should do. The unit test can be written in different ways, but the idea is to provide a test case that covers the expected behavior of the function.  """

# The unit test can be written in different ways. For example, you could test the function with a text that does not contain 'z', like "hello". You could also test the function with a text that contains 'z' at the beginning, like "zpython". The unit test should cover all the expected behaviors of the function. """
