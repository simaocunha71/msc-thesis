The problem is asking to find the maximum run of uppercase characters in a given string. A run is considered as a sequence of uppercase characters without any lowercase characters in between.

Looking at the unit test `assert max_run_uppercase('GeMKSForGERksISBESt') == 5`, it seems that we need to find the maximum run of uppercase characters.

Here is a Python solution for this problem:

```python
def max_run_uppercase(s):
    max_run = 0
    current_run = 0
    for char in s:
        if char.isupper():
            current_run += 1
            max_run = max(max_run, current_run)
        else:
            current_run = 0
    return max_run
```

This function iterates over the string. If the current character is uppercase, it increments the current run and updates the maximum run if necessary. If the current character is lowercase, it resets the current run. Finally, it returns the maximum run of uppercase characters.
