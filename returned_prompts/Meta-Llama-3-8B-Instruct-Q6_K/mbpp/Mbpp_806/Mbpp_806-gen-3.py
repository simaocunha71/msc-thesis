```
def max_run_uppercase(s):
    max_run = 0
    current_run = 0
    for char in s:
        if char.isupper():
            current_run += 1
            max_run = max(max_run, current_run)
        else:
            current_run = 0
    return max_run
```


In this problem, we need to find the maximum run of uppercase characters in a given string. The run of uppercase characters means the sequence of consecutive uppercase characters. We can use a variable to keep track of the maximum run and another variable to keep track of the current run. We iterate through the string and check if the character is uppercase. If it is, we increment the current run and update the maximum run if necessary. If the character is not uppercase, we reset the current run. At the end, we return the maximum run.

The unit test `assert max_run_uppercase('GeMKSForGERksISBESt') == 5` helps to clarify the problem. It indicates that the function should return 5, which is the length of the longest run of uppercase characters in the string 'GeMKSForGERksISBESt'. This run is 'MKSFor'. 

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because we are iterating through the string once. The space complexity is O(1), which means the space required does not change with the size of the input string, so it is constant.
