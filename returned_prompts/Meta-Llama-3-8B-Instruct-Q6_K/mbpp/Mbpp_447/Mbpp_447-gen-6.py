"""
The problem is asking you to create a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list where each element is the cube of the corresponding element in the input list.

Here's a Python function that solves this problem:

```python
def cube_nums(nums):
    return [num**3 for num in nums]
```

This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list, cube each number, and add the result to the output list.

The unit test `assert cube_nums([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])==[1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729, 1000]` ensures that the function works correctly. It checks that the output of the function when given the input list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]` is `[1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729, 1000]`, which is the correct output. If the function is implemented correctly, this unit test should pass.```python

## Test

print(cube_nums([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])) # Output: [1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729, 1000]
assert cube_nums([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])==[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
