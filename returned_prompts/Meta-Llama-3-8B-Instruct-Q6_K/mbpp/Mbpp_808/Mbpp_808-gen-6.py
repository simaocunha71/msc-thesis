```
def check_K(t, k):
    return k in t
```
The problem is asking to create a function that checks if a given tuple contains a specific value (k). The function should return True if the value is found in the tuple, and False otherwise.

The unit test provided, `assert check_K((10, 4, 5, 6, 8), 6) == True`, helps to clarify the problem by showing that the function should return True when the value is found in the tuple.

The solution is a simple function that uses the `in` operator to check if the value `k` is present in the tuple `t`. If it is, the function returns True, otherwise it returns False. This solution passes the provided unit test.
