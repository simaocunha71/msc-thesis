```
def check_K(t, k):
    return k in t
```
The problem is asking to create a function that checks if a specific number `k` is present in a given tuple `t`. The function should return `True` if `k` is in `t` and `False` otherwise.

The unit test `assert check_K((10, 4, 5, 6, 8), 6) == True` suggests that the function should return `True` when `k` is present in `t`.

Here is a simple solution using the `in` operator, which checks if an element is present in a tuple. The function `check_K` takes two arguments: `t` (the tuple) and `k` (the number to be checked). If `k` is in `t`, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
