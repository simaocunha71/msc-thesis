```
def check_K(tuples, k):
    return k in tuples
```





The problem is asking you to create a function that takes a tuple and a value `k` as inputs, and returns `True` if `k` is in the tuple, and `False` otherwise.

The unit test provided, `assert check_K((10, 4, 5, 6, 8), 6) == True`, helps to clarify the problem by showing that the function should return `True` if `k` is in the tuple, and `False` otherwise.

Here's a simple solution in Python:

```
def check_K(tuples, k):
    return k in tuples
```

This function uses the `in` operator to check if `k` is in the tuple. If `k` is in the tuple, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.
