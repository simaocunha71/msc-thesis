```
def check_K(tuples, k):
    return k in tuples
```





The task is to write a function that checks if a given tuple contains a specific value, 'k'.

The provided unit test `assert check_K((10, 4, 5, 6, 8), 6) == True` helps clarify the problem. It suggests that the function should take a tuple and a value 'k' as input and return a boolean indicating whether 'k' is present in the tuple.

Here's a simple Python function that accomplishes this:

```python
def check_K(tuples, k):
    return k in tuples
```

This function uses the `in` operator to check if 'k' is present in the tuple. The `in` operator returns `True` if the value is found in the tuple, and `False` otherwise. The function returns this boolean value as its result.
