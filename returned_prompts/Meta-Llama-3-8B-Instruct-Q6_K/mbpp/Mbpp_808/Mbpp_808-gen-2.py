def check_K(tuples, k):
    for tuple in tuples:
        if k in tuple:
            return True
    return False
```


This function iterates over each tuple in the given list of tuples. If it finds the number `k` in any of the tuples, it immediately returns `True`. If it doesn't find `k` in any of the tuples after checking all of them, it returns `False`. The unit test `assert check_K((10, 4, 5, 6, 8), 6) == True` suggests that the function should return `True` when `k` is found in the tuples, and `False` when `k` is not found. 

For example, if the input is `check_K((10, 4, 5, 6, 8), 6)`, the function will return `True` because `6` is in the tuple `(6, 8)`. If the input is `check_K((10, 4, 5, 8), 6)`, the function will return `False` because `6` is not in any of the tuples. 





```python
def check_K(tuples, k):
    for tuple in tuples:
        if k in tuple:
            return True
    return False
```




This function is case-sensitive. If the tuple contains a string that is equal to `k`, it will still return `False` because the `in` operator checks for exact equality, not for containment. If you want to check for containment regardless of the type of `k`, you can convert `k` to a string before checking:

```python
def check_K(tuples, k):
    k = str(k)
    for tuple in tuples:
        if k in str(tuple):
            return True
    return False
```





This function returns as soon as it finds `k` in any of the tuples, so its time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of tuples. If you want to check all tuples regardless of whether `k` is found in any of them, you can use the `any` function with a generator expression:

```python
def check_K(tuples, k):
    k = str(k)
    return any(str(i) == k for i in itertools.chain(*tuples))
```





This function has a time complexity of O(n) as well, but it uses more memory because it creates a generator expression
