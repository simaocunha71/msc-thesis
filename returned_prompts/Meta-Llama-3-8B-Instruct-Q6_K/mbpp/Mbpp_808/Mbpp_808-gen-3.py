```
def check_K(tup, k):
    return k in tup
```


This function checks if the given tuple `tup` contains the value `k`. It returns `True` if `k` is in `tup`, and `False` otherwise.

The unit test `assert check_K((10, 4, 5, 6, 8), 6) == True` suggests that the function should return `True` when `k` is present in the tuple. This is achieved by using the `in` operator, which checks if a value is present in a sequence.

For example, `check_K((10, 4, 5, 6, 8), 6)` returns `True` because `6` is present in the tuple. On the other hand, `check_K((10, 4, 5, 8), 6)` returns `False` because `6` is not present in the tuple.
