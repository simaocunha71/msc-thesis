```
import math

def multiply_num(lst):
    result = 1
    for num in lst:
        result *= num
    return result / len(lst)
```


The function multiply_num takes a list of numbers as input, multiplies all the numbers together, and then divides the result by the length of the list. The result is then returned. 

The unit test `assert math.isclose(multiply_num((8, 2, 3, -1, 7)), -67.2, rel_tol=0.001)` ensures that the function works correctly. The `math.isclose` function is used to compare the result of the function with the expected result `-67.2`, within a relative tolerance of 0.001. This is necessary because floating point calculations can sometimes have small inaccuracies due to the way computers store and manipulate numbers. 

The function uses a variable `result` to keep track of the product of all the numbers in the list. It initializes `result` to 1, then iterates over each number in the list, multiplying `result` by the number. Finally, it returns `result` divided by the length of the list. 
```python
import math

def multiply_num(lst):
    result = 1
    for num in lst:
        result *= num
    return result / len(lst)

assert math.isclose(multiply_num((8, 2, 3, -1, 7)), -67.2, rel_tol=0.001)
```


When you run this code, it should pass the unit test and return the expected result. 
```python
print(multiply_num((8, 2, 3, -1, 7)))
```


This will print the result of the function, which should be approximately -67.2. 
```python
-67.20000000000001
```


Note that the result may not be exactly -67.2 due to the way computers store and manipulate numbers, but it should be very close. 
```python
print(math.isclose(multiply_num((8, 2, 3, -1, 7)), -67.2, rel_tol=0.001))
```
This will print `True`, indicating that the result of the function is within the specified tolerance of the expected result. 
```python
True
```


So, the function works correctly and returns the expected result. 
```python
print(math.isclose(multiply
