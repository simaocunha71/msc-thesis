```
def multiply_num(numbers):
    product = 1
    for number in numbers:
        product *= number
    return product / len(numbers)
```
The problem is asking to create a function that takes a list of numbers, multiplies all the numbers together, and then divides the result by the length of the list.

The unit test provided suggests that the function should return the result of the multiplication divided by the length of the list. For example, the test `assert math.isclose(multiply_num((8, 2, 3, -1, 7)), -67.2, rel_tol=0.001)` checks that the function returns -67.2 when given the list `(8, 2, 3, -1, 7)`.

Here is a Python function that implements this:

```
def multiply_num(numbers):
    product = 1
    for number in numbers:
        product *= number
    return product / len(numbers)
```

This function initializes a variable `product` to 1, then loops through each number in the input list, multiplying `product` by the current number. Finally, it returns the result of the multiplication divided by the length of the list. The `math.isclose` function is used in the unit test to check that the result is close to the expected value, due to floating point precision issues.  If the actual result is within 0.001 of the expected result, the test passes.  If the result is not close enough, the test fails.  This is a common approach for testing floating point calculations.  If the expected result is an integer, you could use the `assert` statement without `math.isclose` to check that the result is equal to the expected value.  For example, `assert multiply_num((8, 2, 3, -1, 7)) == -67`.  However, this would not handle the case where the expected result is not exactly equal to the actual result due to floating point precision issues.  In that case, `math.isclose` is a more robust approach.  It allows you to specify a tolerance, so that the test will pass if the actual result is within that tolerance of the expected result.  For example, `assert math.isclose(multiply_num((8, 2, 3, -1, 7)), -67.2, rel_tol=0.001)`.  This test will pass if the result of `multiply_num
