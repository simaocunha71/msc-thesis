```
def multiply_num(lst):
    total = 1
    for num in lst:
        total *= num
    return total / len(lst)
```


The problem is asking you to create a function that multiplies all the numbers in a given list and then divides the result by the length of the list. 

The unit test `assert math.isclose(multiply_num((8, 2, 3, -1, 7)), -67.2, rel_tol=0.001)` suggests that the function should return a float result.

Here's a simple solution using Python:

```python
def multiply_num(lst):
    total = 1
    for num in lst:
        total *= num
    return total / len(lst)
```

This function initializes a variable `total` to 1, then iterates over each number in the list, multiplying `total` by that number. Finally, it returns the result of `total` divided by the length of the list. 

The `math.isclose` function is used in the unit test to check if the result is close to the expected value `-67.2` within a relative tolerance of 0.001. This means the actual result can be slightly different due to floating-point precision errors. 

You can use this function to multiply a list of numbers and divide the result by the length of the list. For example:

```python
numbers = [8, 2, 3, -1, 7]
result = multiply_num(numbers)
print(result)  # Output: -67.2
```


This will multiply the numbers in the list `numbers` and divide the result by the length of the list, which is 5. The result is then printed to the console. 

Please note that this function assumes the list is not empty. If the list is empty, it will raise a ZeroDivisionError when trying to divide by the length of the list. You may want to add error handling to handle this case. 

Here's an updated version of the function that handles empty lists:

```python
def multiply_num(lst):
    if not lst:
        return 0
    total = 1
    for num in lst:
        total *= num
    return total / len(lst)
```


This function returns 0 if the list is empty, and the result of multiplying the numbers in the list and dividing by the length of the list otherwise. 

You can use this function to safely multiply a list of numbers
