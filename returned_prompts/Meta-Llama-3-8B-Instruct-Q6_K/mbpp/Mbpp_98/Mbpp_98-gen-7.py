Explanation:
The problem is asking you to create a function that takes a list of numbers as input, multiplies all the numbers together, and then divides the result by the length of the list.

The unit test `assert math.isclose(multiply_num((8, 2, 3, -1, 7)), -67.2, rel_tol=0.001)` helps to clarify the problem by providing an example of what the function should return for a specific input.

Here's how the function works:
1. Initialize a variable `total` to 1.
2. Iterate over each number in the input list `lst`.
3. For each number, multiply `total` by the number.
4. After all numbers have been processed, divide `total` by the length of the list.
5. Return the result.

The `math.isclose` function is used in the unit test to check if the result is close to the expected value `-67.2` with a relative tolerance of 0.001. This means that the actual result can be slightly different from `-67.2` due to floating-point precision errors, but it should be close enough to be considered correct.
