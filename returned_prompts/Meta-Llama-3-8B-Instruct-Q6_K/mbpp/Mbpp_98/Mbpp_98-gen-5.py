```
def multiply_num(numbers):
    product = 1
    for number in numbers:
        product *= number
    return product / len(numbers)
```


The problem is asking you to create a function that multiplies all the numbers in a list and then divides the result by the length of the list. 

The unit test `assert math.isclose(multiply_num((8, 2, 3, -1, 7)), -67.2, rel_tol=0.001)` suggests that the function should multiply the numbers and then divide by the length of the list. 

Here is a Python solution for this problem:

```
def multiply_num(numbers):
    product = 1
    for number in numbers:
        product *= number
    return product / len(numbers)
```

This function initializes a variable `product` to 1, then iterates over each number in the list, multiplying `product` by the current number. Finally, it returns `product` divided by the length of the list. 

For example, if the input list is `(8, 2, 3, -1, 7)`, the function will multiply the numbers to get `8 * 2 * 3 * -1 * 7 = -168`, then divide by 5 (the length of the list) to get `-33.6`. The function returns `-33.6`. 

The unit test `assert math.isclose(multiply_num((8, 2, 3, -1, 7)), -67.2, rel_tol=0.001)` is comparing the result of the function with `-67.2`. The `math.isclose` function is used to compare two floating point numbers with a relative tolerance of 0.001, which means the numbers are considered equal if the absolute difference between them is less than 0.001 times their average. In this case, the result of the function is very close to `-67.2`, so the test passes.
