You can use the built-in `ast.literal_eval()` function in Python to convert a string representation of a tuple to a tuple of integers. Here's how you can do it:

```
def tuple_str_int(s):
    import ast
    return ast.literal_eval(s)
```

This function works by using `ast.literal_eval()` to parse the string `s` as a literal expression. This means it can safely evaluate strings that represent tuples of integers. For example, if you call `tuple_str_int("(7, 8, 9)")`, it will return the tuple `(7, 8, 9)`. The `assert` statement in the problem description confirms that this function works as expected.

Note that `ast.literal_eval()` is safe to use with strings that represent tuples of integers, but it is not safe to use with arbitrary strings. If you try to use it with a string that represents a tuple of arbitrary objects, it will raise a `ValueError`. For example, `ast.literal_eval("[(1, 2), '3', 4]")` will raise a `ValueError` because the string contains a string and an integer, not just integers. If you need to convert strings that represent tuples of arbitrary objects, you will need to use a different approach.
