```
def tuple_str_int(s):
    return eval(s)
```
The problem is asking to create a function that takes a string representation of a tuple (like "(7, 8, 9)") and returns the tuple converted to integers.

The unit test provided, `assert tuple_str_int("(7, 8, 9)") == (7, 8, 9)`, helps to understand the problem better. It shows that the function should return the tuple `(7, 8, 9)` when given the string `"(7, 8, 9)"` as input.

The solution is to use the built-in `eval` function in Python, which parses the string and executes it as Python code. This function can be used to convert the string representation of a tuple to an actual tuple.

Here's the solution:
```
def tuple_str_int(s):
    return eval(s)
```
This function takes a string `s` as input, evaluates it as Python code, and returns the resulting tuple. The `eval` function is safe to use in this context because the input string is a valid Python expression. If the input string is not a valid Python expression, `eval` will raise a `SyntaxError`. However, in this case, we can be sure that the input string is a valid Python expression because it's a string representation of a tuple. Therefore, we can use `eval` safely to convert the string to a tuple.
