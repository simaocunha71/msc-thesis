```
def tuple_str_int(s):
    s = s.strip("()")
    return tuple(int(x) for x in s.split(','))
```



The problem asks you to create a function that takes a string representing a tuple as input and returns a tuple of integers. The string is enclosed in parentheses and the elements are separated by commas.

For example, the input string "(7, 8, 9)" should return the tuple (7, 8, 9).

Here's a Python solution for this problem:

```
def tuple_str_int(s):
    s = s.strip("()")
    return tuple(int(x) for x in s.split(','))
```

This function works by first removing the parentheses from the input string using the `strip` method. Then, it splits the string into a list of strings using the `split` method with a comma as the separator. It converts each string in the list to an integer using a generator expression, and finally, it converts the list of integers to a tuple using the `tuple` function.
