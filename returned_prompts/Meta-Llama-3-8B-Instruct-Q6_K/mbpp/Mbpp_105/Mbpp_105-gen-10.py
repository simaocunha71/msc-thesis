```
def count(lst):
    return lst.count(True)
```





This problem is asking to create a function that counts the number of True values in a given list. The function should take a list as an argument and return the count of True values.

The unit test provided is `assert count([True,False,True]) == 2`, which means the function should return 2 when given the list `[True, False, True]`.

Here's the solution:
```
def count(lst):
    return lst.count(True)
```
This function uses the built-in `count` method of lists, which returns the number of occurrences of the specified element in the list. In this case, the element is `True`. The function takes a list as an argument, counts the number of `True` values in the list, and returns the count.
