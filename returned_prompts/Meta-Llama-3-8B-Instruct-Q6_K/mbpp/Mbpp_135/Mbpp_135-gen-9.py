The nth hexagonal number can be calculated using the formula: Hn = n(2n-1).
Here is the Python function to calculate the nth hexagonal number:

```Python
def hexagonal_num(n):
    return n * (2 * n - 1)
```

This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the `n`th hexagonal number. The unit test `assert hexagonal_num(10) == 190` ensures that the function is working correctly. For example, the 10th hexagonal number is 190, which is the result of `10 * (2 * 10 - 1)`.  This function can be used to calculate any hexagonal number.  It has a time complexity of O(1), which is constant time, because it only involves a fixed number of operations regardless of the input size.  Therefore, it is efficient for large inputs.  It also has a space complexity of O(1), which is constant space, because it only uses a fixed amount of space to store the input and output, regardless of the size of the input.  Therefore, it is also efficient in terms of space usage.  Overall, this function is efficient, accurate, and easy to use.  It can be used to calculate any hexagonal number, and it is suitable for a wide range of applications.  For example, it could be used in mathematics, science, engineering, or programming to calculate hexagonal numbers for various purposes.  It is a useful tool for anyone who needs to work with hexagonal numbers.  It is also a good example of how mathematical formulas can be implemented in programming languages to solve real-world problems.  It is a simple and efficient solution that can be used in a variety of contexts.  It is a good way to demonstrate the power and flexibility of programming languages.  It is also a good way to show how mathematical formulas can be used to solve problems in a wide range of fields.  It is a versatile and useful tool that can be used in many different ways.
