The nth hexagonal number is given by the formula: Hn = n(2n-1). Here is the Python function that calculates the nth hexagonal number:

```Python
def hexagonal_num(n):
    return n * (2 * n - 1)
```

This function takes an integer n as input and returns the nth hexagonal number. For example, hexagonal_num(10) returns 190, which is the 10th hexagonal number. 

Note that the problem statement does not specify the format of the output, but based on the provided unit test, it seems that the output should be an integer. Therefore, the function returns the result as an integer. If the output should be a string in the format "0x...", the function could be modified accordingly. 

Also, the unit test `assert hexagonal_num(10) == 190` helps to clarify the expected output format. It suggests that the output should be an integer, not a string. Therefore, the function returns the result as an integer. 

The function is simple and efficient, with a time complexity of O(1) and a space complexity of O(1), as it only requires a constant amount of space to store the variables and does not perform any operations that depend on the size of the input. 

This function can be used to calculate the nth hexagonal number for any positive integer n. It is a simple and efficient solution for this problem.  """  # noqa: E501
