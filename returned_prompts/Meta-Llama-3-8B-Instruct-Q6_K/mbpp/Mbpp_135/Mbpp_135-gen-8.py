The nth hexagonal number is given by the formula n*(2*n-1). 
Here is a Python function that calculates the nth hexagonal number:

```python
def hexagonal_num(n):
    return n * (2 * n - 1)
```
This function passes the given unit test:

```python
assert hexagonal_num(10) == 190
```  # 10*(2*10-1) = 10*19 = 190
```python
```


This function takes an integer n as input and returns the nth hexagonal number. The formula `n*(2*n-1)` is used to calculate the nth hexagonal number. This function passes the given unit test. The unit test checks if the function returns the correct result for the input 10, which is 190.  This function is efficient and scalable for calculating large hexagonal numbers.  It can be used to calculate any nth hexagonal number.  It does not have any time complexity issues.  It is a simple and straightforward solution.
