def hexagonal_num(n):
    return n * (2 * n - 1)
```
The nth hexagonal number is given by the formula n * (2 * n - 1). This is a mathematical property of hexagonal numbers. The unit test `assert hexagonal_num(10) == 190` confirms this. For example, the 10th hexagonal number is 190, which can be calculated by the formula. 

This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth hexagonal number. It does not require a dictionary or any iteration. It is a simple mathematical function that can be used to calculate any hexagonal number.
