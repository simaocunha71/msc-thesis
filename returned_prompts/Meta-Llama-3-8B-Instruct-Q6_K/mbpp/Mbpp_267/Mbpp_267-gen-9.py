The function `square_Sum` calculates the sum of the squares of the first `n` odd natural numbers. It uses a generator expression to generate the odd numbers from 1 to `2*n+1` and then squares each number before summing them up. The `range` function is used to generate the sequence of numbers, with the step size set to 2 to ensure that only odd numbers are included. The `assert` statement at the end of the problem ensures that the function works correctly for `n=2`.  For example, the sum of the squares of the first 2 odd natural numbers is 1^2 + 3^2 = 1 + 9 = 10.  The function `square_Sum` will return 10 for `n=2`.  For any other `n`, it will return the sum of the squares of the first `n` odd natural numbers.  For example, `square_Sum(3)` will return the sum of the squares of the first 3 odd natural numbers, which is 1^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 = 1 + 9 + 25 = 35.  The function `square_Sum` works correctly for any positive integer `n`.  It does not work correctly for non-integer values of `n`, as the problem statement does not specify the behavior of the function for non-integer values of `n`.  Therefore, the function `square_Sum` should be used with caution and only with positive integer values of `n`.  If a non-integer value of `n` is used, the function may return an incorrect result.  The function `square_Sum` is simple and easy to use, and it works correctly for any positive integer value of `n`.  It is a good solution to the problem.  The function `square_Sum` has a time complexity of O(n), as it needs to iterate over the first `n` odd natural numbers to calculate the sum of their squares.  The function `square_Sum` has a space complexity of O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the sum and the current number.  The function `square_Sum` is efficient and scalable, as it can handle large values of `n` and it
