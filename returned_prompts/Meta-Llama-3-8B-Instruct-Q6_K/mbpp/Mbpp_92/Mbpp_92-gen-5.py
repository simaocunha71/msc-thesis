The problem is asking you to write a function that determines whether a given number is undulating or not. An undulating number is a number that has the same digits repeated in a sequence.

For example, the number 1212121 is undulating because it has the same digit 1 repeated in a sequence.

The unit test `assert is_undulating(1212121) == True` suggests that the function should return `True` for undulating numbers and `False` for non-undulating numbers.

Here's a Python function that solves the problem:
```
def is_undulating(n):
    str_n = str(n)
    for i in range(len(str_n) - 1):
        if str_n[i] != str_n[i+1]:
            return False
    return True
```
This function converts the input number to a string and then checks if all consecutive digits are the same. If they are not, the function returns `False`. If all consecutive digits are the same, the function returns `True`. This indicates that the number is undulating.
