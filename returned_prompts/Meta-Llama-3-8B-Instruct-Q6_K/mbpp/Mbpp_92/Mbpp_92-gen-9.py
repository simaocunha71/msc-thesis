The problem is asking to write a function that checks if a given number is undulating or not. An undulating number is a number that is composed of repeating digits.

For example, the number 1212121 is undulating because it is composed of repeating digits.

The unit test `assert is_undulating(1212121) == True` suggests that the function should return True for the number 1212121.

Here is a Python solution for the problem:
```
def is_undulating(n):
    n = str(n)
    if len(set(n)) == 1:
        return True
    return False
```
This function converts the given number to a string, then checks if the length of the set of characters in the string is 1. If it is, then the number is undulating, and the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
