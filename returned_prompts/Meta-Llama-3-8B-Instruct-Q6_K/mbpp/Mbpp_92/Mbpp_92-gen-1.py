```
def is_undulating(n):
    return str(n)[1:-1].replace(str(n)[0], '') == ''
```
The unit test `assert is_undulating(1212121) == True` suggests that the function should return `True` for the given number `1212121`. This is because the number is undulating, meaning that it has a repeating pattern.

The function `is_undulating` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the number is undulating or not.

Here's how the function works:
1. Convert the integer `n` to a string using `str(n)`.
2. Slice the string to remove the first and last characters using `str(n)[1:-1]`.
3. Replace all occurrences of the first character of the string with an empty string using `str(n)[0]`.
4. Compare the resulting string with an empty string. If they are equal, it means that the number is undulating, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
