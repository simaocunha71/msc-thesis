The problem is asking to write a function that determines whether a given number is undulating or not. However, the problem doesn't clearly define what an undulating number is. 

Luckily, the provided unit test `assert is_undulating(1212121) == True` gives us a hint. It seems that an undulating number is a number that has an alternating pattern of digits. For example, the number 1212121 is undulating because it has an alternating pattern of 1 and 2.

Here's a Python function that checks if a number is undulating:

```python
def is_undulating(n):
    n = str(n)
    for i in range(1, len(n)):
        if n[i] == n[i-1]:
            return False
    return True
```

This function converts the given number to a string and then iterates over the string. If it finds any pair of adjacent digits that are the same, it returns `False`, indicating that the number is not undulating. If it doesn't find any such pair, it returns `True`, indicating that the number is undulating. 

For example, `is_undulating(1212121)` returns `True` and `is_undulating(1234567)` returns `False`. 

Note that this function considers a number as undulating only if it has an alternating pattern of digits throughout. It doesn't consider a number as undulating if it has an alternating pattern only at the beginning or end of the number. For example, `is_undulating(123456)` returns `False` because it doesn't have an alternating pattern throughout. 

To consider a number as undulating even if it has an alternating pattern only at the beginning or end, you can modify the function to return `True` as soon as it finds an alternating pattern. Here's the modified function:

```python
def is_undulating(n):
    n = str(n)
    for i in range(1, len(n)):
        if n[i] != n[i-1]:
            return True
    return False
``` 

This modified function returns `True` as soon as it finds an alternating pattern, even if it's only at the beginning or end of the number. For example, `is_undulating(123456)` returns `True` in this case.  However, this modified function considers a number as undulating even if it has a non-alternating pattern at the beginning or end.
