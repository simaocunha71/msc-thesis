The problem is asking you to write a function that determines whether a given number is undulating or not. An undulating number is a number that has at least one pair of consecutive digits that are the same.

For example, the number 1212121 is undulating because it has multiple pairs of consecutive digits that are the same.

Here's a Python function that solves this problem:

```python
def is_undulating(n):
    return any(str(d) * 2 in str(n) for d in str(n))
```

This function works by iterating over each digit in the input number, and then checking if there are at least two consecutive occurrences of that digit in the number. If it finds a pair of consecutive digits, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

The unit test `assert is_undulating(1212121) == True` ensures that the function correctly identifies the number 1212121 as undulating.
