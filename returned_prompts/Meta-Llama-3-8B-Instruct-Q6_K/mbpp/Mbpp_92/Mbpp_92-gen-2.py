The problem is asking to write a function that checks whether a given number is undulating or not. An undulating number is a number that has at least three consecutive digits that are the same.

The unit test `assert is_undulating(1212121) == True` suggests that the number 1212121 is an undulating number because it has at least three consecutive digits that are the same.

Here is the Python solution for the problem:

```
def is_undulating(n):
    s = str(n)
    for i in range(len(s) - 2):
        if s[i] == s[i+1] == s[i+2]:
            return True
    return False
```


This function converts the given number into a string and then checks every three consecutive digits in the string. If it finds three consecutive digits that are the same, it returns True, indicating that the number is undulating. If it doesn't find any such sequence, it returns False.
