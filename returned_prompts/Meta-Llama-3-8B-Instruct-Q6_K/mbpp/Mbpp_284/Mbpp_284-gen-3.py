def check_element(lst, element):
    return all(item == element for item in lst)
```





The unit test `assert check_element(["green", "orange", "black", "white"],'blue')==False` suggests that the function should return `False` if all items in the list are not equal to the given element. 

The function `check_element` takes in a list `lst` and an element `element`, and returns `True` if all items in the list are equal to the given element, and `False` otherwise. This is achieved using the `all` function and a generator expression. The `all` function returns `True` if all elements of the iterable (in this case, the generator expression) are true. The generator expression `item == element for item in lst` checks if each item in the list is equal to the given element. If any item is not equal to the given element, the `all` function will return `False`. If all items are equal to the given element, the `all` function will return `True`. 





Note that the unit test provided does not check for the case where all items in the list are equal to the given element. To test this case, you could add another unit test, such as `assert check_element(["blue", "blue", "blue", "blue"],'blue')==True`. 





The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the list, because it needs to iterate over the entire list. The space complexity is O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the function's variables. 





The function is case-sensitive, meaning that it will treat 'blue' and 'Blue' as different elements. If you want the function to be case-insensitive, you could convert the element and each item in the list to the same case (e.g., lowercase) before comparing them. For example: `return all(item.lower() == element.lower() for item in lst)`. 





The function will work with lists of any type that can be compared for equality, not just strings. For example, you could use it with a list of integers or a list of objects. 





The function will also work with lists containing non-hashable types, such as lists or dictionaries, as long as the elements of the list are comparable for equality. 





The function will raise a TypeError if the list contains non-comparable elements, or if the element
