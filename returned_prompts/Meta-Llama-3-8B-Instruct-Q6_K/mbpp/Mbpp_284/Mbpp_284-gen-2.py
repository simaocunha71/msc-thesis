```
def check_element(lst, element):
    return all(i == element for i in lst)
```





The problem is asking to create a function that checks if all elements in a given list are equal to a specific element. 

The provided unit test suggests that the function should return a boolean value indicating whether all elements in the list are equal to the given element. 

Here's a Python solution using the built-in `all` function and a generator expression:

```
def check_element(lst, element):
    return all(i == element for i in lst)
```

This function uses the `all` function to check if all elements in the list are equal to the given element. The generator expression `i == element for i in lst` generates a sequence of boolean values, where each value is `True` if the corresponding element in the list is equal to the given element, and `False` otherwise. The `all` function then returns `True` if all these values are `True`, and `False` otherwise. 

For example, if you call `check_element(["green", "orange", "black", "white"], 'blue')`, the function will return `False` because not all elements in the list are equal to 'blue'. If all elements in the list were equal to 'blue', the function would return `True`. 





This function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the problem description, and it should pass the provided unit test.
