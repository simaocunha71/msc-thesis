```
def Split(lst):
    return [i for i in lst if i % 2 != 0]
```


Explanation:
The task is to create a function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list containing only the odd numbers from the original list. 

The unit test `assert Split([1,2,3,4,5,6]) == [1,3,5]` suggests that the function should return a list of odd integers.

We can achieve this using a list comprehension in Python. The list comprehension iterates over the input list, checks if each number is odd by using the condition `i % 2 != 0`, and includes it in the new list if it is.

The function `Split(lst)` takes a list `lst` as input, and returns a new list containing only the odd numbers from `lst`. The unit test `assert Split([1,2,3,4,5,6]) == [1,3,5]` confirms that the function works as expected.
