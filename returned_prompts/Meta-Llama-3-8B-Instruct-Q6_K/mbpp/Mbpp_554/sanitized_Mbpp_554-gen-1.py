def Split(lst):
    return [i for i in lst if i % 2 != 0]  # Use list comprehension to filter odd numbers.   # Test the function with the given unit test.   print(Split([1,2,3,4,5,6]))  # Output: [1,3,5]   # This function works by iterating over each number in the list, and checking if it's odd (i.e., if the remainder when divided by 2 is not 0). If the number is odd, it's included in the new list. The list comprehension syntax [i for i in lst if i % 2 != 0] creates a new list with only the odd numbers.   # This function is efficient because it only iterates over the input list once, making its time complexity O(n), where n is the length of the input list. Its space complexity is also O(n), because it creates a new list that's as long as the input list.   # This function is easy to understand and use, making it a good choice for many applications.   # However, it's worth noting that this function doesn't handle non-integer inputs. If you need to handle non-integer inputs, you might need to add some error checking code.   # For example, you could use a try-except block to catch any non-integer values in the input list, and raise an error or handle them in some way.   # Here's an example of how you might add error checking to this function:   def Split(lst):       result = []       for i in lst:           if not isinstance(i, int):               raise ValueError("Input list must only contain integers")           if i % 2 != 0:               result.append(i)       return result   # With this error checking code, the function will raise an error if it encounters a non-integer value in the input list.   # You could also add some documentation to the function to explain how it works and what it does, and to specify any error handling it uses.   # Here's an example of how you might add documentation to this function:   def Split(lst):       """Return a list of the odd integers in the input list.       Args:           lst (list): The input list of integers.       Returns:           list: The list of odd integers.
