# Test the function
print(Split([1,2,3,4,5,6]))  # Expected output: [1,3,5]

Explanation:
The function `Split` takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list that contains only the odd integers from the input list. This is achieved by using a list comprehension that iterates over the input list and includes each integer in the output list if it is not divisible by 2 (i.e., if it is odd). The `assert` statement checks that the function returns the expected output for the input `[1,2,3,4,5,6]`. The `print` statement calls the function with this input and prints the result, which should be `[1,3,5]`. 

The unit test is a doctest, which is a way to test the function by providing examples of input and expected output. The `assert` statement checks that the function returns the expected output for the given input. 

The function works by iterating over the input list and including each integer in the output list if it is not divisible by 2. The `if i % 2 != 0` condition is used to check if a number is odd. If the remainder of the division of the number by 2 is not 0, then the number is odd and is included in the output list. Otherwise, the number is even and is not included in the output list. 

The function returns the output list, which contains only the odd integers from the input list. 

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input list, because it iterates over the list once. The space complexity is O(n) as well, because it creates a new list that contains the odd integers. 

This function is easy to understand and modify, and it is efficient for large input lists. It is also flexible, as it can be used with any list of integers, not just the specific input `[1,2,3,4,5,6]`. 

The doctest at the beginning of the code is a way to test the function with a specific input and expected output. The `assert` statement checks that the function returns the expected output for the given input. If the function returns the wrong output, the `assert` statement will raise an `AssertionError`.
