You are trying to write a function that returns a tuple of two integers, x and y, such that ax + by = n, where a, b, and n are given. If no solution exists, the function should return None.

The problem is a bit unclear, but we can infer that the function should find the integer solutions for the given linear Diophantine equation. 

The unit test `assert find_solution(2, 3, 7) == (2, 1)` suggests that the function should return the tuple of integers (2, 1) which satisfy the equation 2*2 + 3*1 = 7.

Here is the solution:
```
def find_solution(a, b, n):
    if a == 0:
        if b == 0:
            return None
        else:
            return n // b, 0
    else:
        if a > 0:
            gcd, x, y = extended_euclidean(a, b)
            if n % gcd != 0:
                return None
            else:
                x0 = x * (n // gcd)
                y0 = y * (n // gcd)
                return x0 % (a // gcd), y0 % (b // gcd)
        else:
            gcd, x, y = extended_euclidean(-a, b)
            if n % gcd != 0:
                return None
            else:
                x0 = x * (n // gcd) + b * (n // gcd) // a
                return x0, y0
```

The function uses the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the coefficients x and y. If the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b does not divide n, the function returns None. Otherwise, it calculates the integer solutions by multiplying the coefficients with n divided by the gcd.

Note: The extended Euclidean algorithm is a classic algorithm in number theory that finds the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two integers and also finds the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity. It is used in many applications, including the solution of linear Diophantine equations. The algorithm is based on the principle that the gcd of two numbers is the same as the gcd of their difference and one of the numbers. It is an efficient algorithm that has a time complexity of O(log(min(a, b)))."""
