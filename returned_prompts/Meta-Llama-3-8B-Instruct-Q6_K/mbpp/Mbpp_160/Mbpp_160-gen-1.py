The problem is asking to write a function that finds two integers x and y that satisfy the equation ax + by = n. However, the problem is missing a crucial piece of information, which is the range of values for x and y. 

Fortunately, one of the unit tests provides a hint about how to solve this problem. The unit test `assert find_solution(2, 3, 7) == (2, 1)` suggests that the function should return the smallest non-negative solution for x and y. 

Here's a Python solution that uses the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the solution:

```
def find_solution(a, b, n):
    def extended_euclidean(a, b):
        if a == 0:
            return b, 0, 1
        else:
            gcd, x, y = extended_euclidean(b % a, a)
            return gcd, y - (b // a) * x, x

    gcd, x, _ = extended_euclidean(a, b)
    if n % gcd != 0:
        return None
    x0, _ = divmod(x * n // gcd, a)
    y0, _ = divmod(-x0 * b // gcd, b)
    return x0, y0
```

This function first calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. Then, it checks if n is divisible by the gcd. If it's not, the function returns None because there's no solution. If n is divisible by the gcd, the function calculates the solution x0 and y0 using the values of x and y from the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. Finally, the function returns the solution as a tuple.
