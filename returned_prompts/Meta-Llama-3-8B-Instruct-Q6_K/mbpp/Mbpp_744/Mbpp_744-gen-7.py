```
def check_none(t):
    return None in t
```


This function takes a tuple `t` as input and checks if it contains `None` using the `in` operator. If `None` is found in the tuple, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

The provided unit test `assert check_none((10, 4, 5, 6, None)) == True` helps to clarify the expected behavior of the function. It indicates that the function should return `True` when the tuple contains `None`.

Note that this solution assumes that the input is a tuple. If the input can be any iterable, you may want to modify the function to check if the input is a tuple or a list before checking for `None`. However, based on the provided unit test, it seems that the input is indeed a tuple.
