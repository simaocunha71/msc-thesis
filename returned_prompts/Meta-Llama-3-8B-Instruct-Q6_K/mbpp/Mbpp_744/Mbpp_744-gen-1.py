```
def check_none(t):
    return any(i is None for i in t)
```


The problem is asking you to create a function called `check_none` that takes a tuple as an argument and returns `True` if the tuple contains any `None` value, and `False` otherwise.

In the unit test provided, `check_none((10, 4, 5, 6, None))` is expected to return `True` because the tuple contains a `None` value.

Here's how you can solve this problem using the `any` function and a generator expression:

```
def check_none(t):
    return any(i is None for i in t)
```

This function works by iterating over each element `i` in the tuple `t`. If `i` is `None`, the `any` function will immediately return `True`. If `i` is not `None` for all elements, `any` will return `False`. This is because `any` short-circuits as soon as it encounters a `True` value, and `False` is the default value for an empty sequence. So, if `any` doesn't find any `None` values, it will return `False`.

This solution is concise and efficient, and it passes the provided unit test.
