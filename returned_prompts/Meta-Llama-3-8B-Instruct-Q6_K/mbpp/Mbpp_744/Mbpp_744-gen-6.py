```
def check_none(tup):
    return None in tup
```
The function `check_none` takes a tuple as an argument and checks if it contains any `None` value. It returns `True` if the tuple contains `None` and `False` otherwise.

The unit test `assert check_none((10, 4, 5, 6, None)) == True` ensures that the function works correctly. It checks if the function returns `True` when the tuple contains `None`. If the function returns the expected result, the test passes. If not, it fails. This test helps to verify the correctness of the function. 

Note: The `assert` statement is used to test the correctness of the function. If the test fails, it raises an `AssertionError`. In this case, it ensures that the function returns `True` when the tuple contains `None`. If the function returns `False` or any other value, the test fails and the code execution stops. 

The provided unit test ensures that the function works correctly and helps to prevent bugs in the code. It is an essential part of software development and testing.
