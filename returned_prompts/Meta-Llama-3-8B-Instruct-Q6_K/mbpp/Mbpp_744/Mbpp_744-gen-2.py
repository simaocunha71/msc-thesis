```
def check_none(t):
    return any(t) == True
```


The given problem is asking to create a function that checks if a tuple contains any None value or not. The function should return True if the tuple contains None and False if it doesn't.

The unit test provided is `assert check_none((10, 4, 5, 6, None)) == True`, which indicates that the function should return True if the tuple contains None.

The solution to this problem is a simple function that uses the built-in `any` function in Python. The `any` function returns True if at least one element in the tuple is True. In this case, we check if any element in the tuple is None.

Here's how you can use the function:

```
print(check_none((10, 4, 5, 6, None)))  # Output: True
print(check_none((10, 4, 5, 6)))  # Output: False
```


The `any` function is a clever way to solve this problem, as it can be used with any iterable, not just tuples. It's also a good example of how to use the `any` function in a more complex context.
