```
def check_none(tup):
    return None in tup
```



Explanation:
The problem is asking to create a function that checks if a given tuple contains any `None` value or not. 

The provided unit test `assert check_none((10, 4, 5, 6, None)) == True` suggests that the function should return `True` if the tuple contains `None` and `False` otherwise.

The solution is a simple one-liner that uses the `in` operator to check if `None` is present in the tuple. If it is, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

This solution passes the provided unit test and is a concise and efficient way to solve the problem.
