This function works by iterating over each element in the tuple. If the element is also a tuple, it recursively calls itself with that tuple. If the element is not a tuple, it adds it to the result tuple. This way, all nested tuples are flattened and removed from the result. The unit test provided ensures that this function works correctly for a given input. For example, `remove_nested((1, 5, 7, (4, 6), 10))` returns `(1, 5, 7, 10)`.  # This function works by iterating over each element in the tuple.
