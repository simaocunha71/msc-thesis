The problem is asking to create a function that takes a tuple as input and returns a new tuple with all the nested tuples removed. For example, if the input tuple is `(1, 5, 7, (4, 6), 10)`, the output should be `(1, 5, 7, 10)`.

Here is a Python solution for this problem:
```
def remove_nested(t):
    new_t = ()
    for item in t:
        if isinstance(item, tuple):
            continue
        new_t += (item,)
    return new_t
```
This function iterates over each item in the input tuple. If the item is a tuple itself, it skips it. Otherwise, it adds the item to the new tuple. Finally, it returns the new tuple.

The unit test `assert remove_nested((1, 5, 7, (4, 6), 10)) == (1, 5, 7, 10)` ensures that the function works correctly. It checks that the function removes the nested tuple `(4, 6)` from the input tuple and returns the resulting tuple `(1, 5, 7, 10)`.

You can use this function to remove nested tuples from any tuple. For example, `remove_nested((1, 2, (3, 4), (5, 6, (7, 8)), 9))` would return `(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9)`.
