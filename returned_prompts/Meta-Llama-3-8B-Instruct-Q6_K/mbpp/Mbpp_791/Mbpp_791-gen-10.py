```
def remove_nested(t):
    if isinstance(t, tuple):
        result = []
        for i in t:
            if isinstance(i, tuple):
                result.extend(remove_nested(i))
            else:
                result.append(i)
        return tuple(result)
    return ()
```    
The problem is asking to write a function that removes nested tuples from a given tuple. For example, if the input is `(1, 5, 7, (4, 6), 10)`, the output should be `(1, 5, 7, 10)`.

The unit test `assert remove_nested((1, 5, 7, (4, 6), 10)) == (1, 5, 7, 10)` helps to clarify the problem by providing an example of the expected output.

The solution uses recursion to traverse the tuple and its nested tuples. If an element is a tuple itself, the function calls itself with that tuple as the argument and concatenates the results. If an element is not a tuple, it is added to the result list. Finally, the result list is converted to a tuple and returned. If the input is not a tuple, the function returns an empty tuple.
