```
def max_sub_array_sum_repeated(arr, k, max_sum):
    # Repeat the array k times
    repeated_arr = arr * k
    
    # Initialize the maximum sum and the current sum
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    current_sum = 0
    
    # Iterate over the repeated array
    for num in repeated_arr:
        # Add the current number to the current sum
        current_sum += num
        
        # If the current sum is greater than the maximum sum, update the maximum sum
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum
        
        # If the current sum is less than 0, reset it to 0
        if current_sum < 0:
            current_sum = 0
    
    # Return the maximum sum
    return max_sum
```

This function takes three parameters: the input array, the number of times to repeat the array, and the maximum sum. It first repeats the array k times and then finds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in the repeated array. The maximum sum is updated at each step as the current sum becomes greater than the maximum sum. If the current sum becomes less than 0, it is reset to 0 to avoid negative sums. Finally, the function returns the maximum sum.

The unit test `assert max_sub_array_sum_repeated([10, 20, -30, -1], 4, 3) == 30` ensures that the function works correctly. The modified array is `[10, 20, -30, -1, 10, 20, -30, -1, 10, 20, -30, -1, 10, 20, -30, -1]` and the largest sum of a contiguous subarray is 30. The function returns `30` as expected.
