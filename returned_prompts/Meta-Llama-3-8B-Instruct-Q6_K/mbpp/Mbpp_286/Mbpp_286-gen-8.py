The problem is asking to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in the array that is formed by repeating the given array k times. The function max_sub_array_sum_repeated takes three parameters: the array, the number of times it should be repeated, and the length of the array.

The function repeats the array k times and then finds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in the repeated array. It initializes max_sum to negative infinity and then iterates over the array to find the maximum sum. The function returns the maximum sum.

The unit test `assert max_sub_array_sum_repeated([10, 20, -30, -1], 4, 3) == 30` helps to understand the problem better. It shows that the array [10, 20, -30, -1] should be repeated 4 times, and the function should return the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in the repeated array, which is 30 in this case. 

The time complexity of this function is O(n^2) because it has a nested loop that iterates over the array. The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the maximum sum and the window sum.
