This problem is asking to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in an array that is formed by repeating the given array k times. The array is modified by repeating it m times, where m is the length of the array.

The given unit test `assert max_sub_array_sum_repeated([10, 20, -30, -1], 4, 3) == 30` helps to understand the problem better. It means that the array [10, 20, -30, -1] is repeated 4 times to form the modified array, and then the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in this modified array is 30.

Here is the Python solution for this problem. It first repeats the array m times, then uses Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray. 

The function `max_sub_array_sum_repeated` takes three parameters: the given array `arr`, the number of times the array is repeated `k`, and the length of the array `m`. It returns the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in the modified array.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the array. This is because we are repeating the array m times, which takes O(m) time, and then using Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray, which takes O(n) time. The space complexity is O(1), as we are not using any extra space that scales with the input size.
