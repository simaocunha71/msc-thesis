This function first calculates the total sum of the array. Then it finds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in the given array. The maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in the modified array which is formed by repeating the given array k times is the maximum sum found in the given array plus the sum of the rest of the array which is (total_sum - max_sum) * k. The time complexity of this function is O(n^2) where n is the length of the array. This is because it needs to iterate over the array to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and the total sum of the array. The space complexity is O(1) which means the space required does not change with the size of the input array, so it is constant.  For example, if we have an array [10, 20, -30, -1] and we repeat it 4 times, the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in the modified array will be the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in the given array plus the sum of the rest of the array which is (total_sum - max_sum) * k. The maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in the given array is 30. The sum of the rest of the array is (10 + 20 - 30 - 1) * 4 = 30. So, the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in the modified array is 30 + 30 = 60.  The function max_sub_array_sum_repeated([10, 20, -30, -1], 4, 3) returns 60.  It passes the test case.
