You can solve this problem with the following function:
```python
def max_sub_array_sum_repeated(arr, k, n):
    arr = arr * k
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    current_sum = 0
    for num in arr:
        current_sum = max(num, current_sum + num)
        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    return max_sum
```
This function first repeats the given array k times. Then it initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity and `current_sum` to 0. It then iterates over the array, updating `current_sum` to be the maximum of the current number and the sum of the current number and `current_sum`, and updating `max_sum` to be the maximum of `max_sum` and `current_sum`. Finally, it returns `max_sum`, which is the largest sum of a contiguous array in the modified array. This function passes the given unit test.
```python
assert max_sub_array_sum_repeated([10, 20, -30, -1], 4, 3) == 30
```"""
This code uses a sliding window technique to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in the modified array. The modified array is created by repeating the given array k times. The function then iterates over the modified array, keeping track of the current sum and the maximum sum seen so far. The current sum is updated to be the maximum of the current number and the sum of the current number and the previous current sum. The maximum sum is updated to be the maximum of the current maximum sum and the current sum. Finally, the function returns the maximum sum, which is the largest sum of a contiguous subarray in the modified array. This function is efficient because it only needs to iterate over the modified array once, and it uses a sliding window to keep track of the current sum and the maximum sum. This makes the function have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the modified array.
