The problem is asking to write a function that checks if a given string contains 'z' anywhere except at the start and end of the word. 

However, the problem description does not specify if the function should return True or False. But based on the unit test provided, `assert text_match_wordz_middle("pythonzabc.")==True`, it seems that the function should return True if the string contains 'z' anywhere except at the start and end of the word, and False otherwise.

Here's a Python solution for this problem:

```Python
def text_match_wordz_middle(text):
    return 'z' in text[1:-1]
```

This function uses Python's string slicing feature to get the middle part of the string (excluding the start and end), and then checks if 'z' is in that part. If 'z' is found, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.  The unit test `assert text_match_wordz_middle("pythonzabc.")==True` passes with this function.  Note that this function is case-sensitive, so it will not match 'Z' in the string. If you want a case-insensitive match, you can convert the string to lower case or upper case before checking: `return 'z' in text[1:-1].lower()`.  Also, if you want to match 'z' at the start or end of the word as well, you can return 'z' in text.  But based on the unit test, it seems that 'z' should not be at the start or end of the word.  Therefore, this function is correct according to the unit test.  If the unit test is incorrect or incomplete, this function may need to be modified.  For example, if the unit test should return False for strings that contain 'z' at the start or end, the function should be modified to return False for those cases.  But based on the unit test, this function is correct.  It passes the unit test and seems to correctly solve the problem as described.  Therefore, it is the correct solution for this problem.  If you have any doubts, you can ask for more clarification or details.  I hope this helps.  Let me know if you have any other questions.  I'm here to help.  Thank you for your attention.
