The problem is asking to write a function that checks if a given string contains the character 'z' anywhere in the middle (not at the start or end) of the word. 

The provided unit test `assert text_match_wordz_middle("pythonzabc.")==True` suggests that the function should return True if the string contains 'z' in the middle, and False otherwise.

Here's a Python solution for the problem:

```python
def text_match_wordz_middle(s):
    for i in range(1, len(s)-1):
        if s[i] == 'z':
            return True
    return False
```

This function iterates over the string, starting from the second character (index 1) to the second last character (index `len(s)-2`). If it finds a 'z' at any of these positions, it immediately returns True. If it doesn't find any 'z' in the middle of the string, it returns False.  The `len(s)-1` index is excluded as per the problem statement to ensure 'z' is not at the end of the string.  The `1` index is excluded as per the problem statement to ensure 'z' is not at the start of the string.  The `range(1, len(s)-1)` is used to generate the indices from 1 to `len(s)-2`.  The `s[i] == 'z'` checks if the character at the current index is 'z'.  The `return True` statement immediately stops the function execution when 'z' is found in the middle of the string.  The `return False` statement is executed when the function has checked all characters in the string and hasn't found 'z' in the middle.   This solution passes the provided unit test.
