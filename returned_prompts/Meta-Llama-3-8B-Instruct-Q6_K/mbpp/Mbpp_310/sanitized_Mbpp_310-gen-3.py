def string_to_tuple(s):
    return tuple(s)  # Python's built-in function to convert a string to a tuple of characters. 
    # It works by iterating over each character in the string and adding it to the tuple. 
    # The resulting tuple contains all the characters in the original string in the same order. 
    # For example, if the input is "python 3.0", the output will be ('p', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n', '3', '.', '0'). 
    # This is a very efficient and easy-to-understand solution. 
    # It is also the most Pythonic way to solve this problem.  #
