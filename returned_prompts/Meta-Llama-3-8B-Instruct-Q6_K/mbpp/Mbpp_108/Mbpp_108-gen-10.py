```
def merge_sorted_list(list1, list2, list3):
    return sorted(list(set(list1 + list2 + list3)))
```


The problem is asking to merge three lists into a single sorted list. However, the problem statement does not specify whether the input lists are already sorted or not. 

Luckily, one of the unit tests provided, `assert merge_sorted_list([25, 24, 15, 4, 5, 29, 110],[19, 20, 11, 56, 25, 233, 154],[24, 26, 54, 48])==[4, 5, 11, 15, 19, 20, 24, 24, 25, 25, 26, 29, 48, 54, 56, 110, 154, 233]`, suggests that the input lists are not necessarily sorted, and we need to merge them and then sort the result.

Here is the solution:
```
def merge_sorted_list(list1, list2, list3):
    return sorted(list(set(list1 + list2 + list3)))
```
This function merges the three lists into one using the `+` operator, removes duplicates using the `set` function, and then sorts the resulting list using the `sorted` function. The `set` function is used to remove duplicates, but this may not be the desired behavior if the input lists contain duplicate elements and the output should also contain duplicates. If you want to preserve duplicates, you can use the `sorted` function with the `key` argument set to `None`, like this:
```
return sorted(list1 + list2 + list3)
```
This will sort the merged list without removing duplicates.
