```
def merge_sorted_list(list1, list2, list3):
    return sorted(list1 + list2 + list3)
```
The problem asks you to merge three sorted lists into a single sorted list. 

The unit test provided suggests that the input lists are not necessarily sorted, so the function should sort the merged list. 

Here's a simple solution using the built-in `sorted` function in Python. This function concatenates the three input lists and then sorts the resulting list. The `sorted` function returns a new sorted list and leaves the original list unchanged.

Here's how you can use this function:
```
list1 = [25, 24, 15, 4, 5, 29, 110]
list2 = [19, 20, 11, 56, 25, 233, 154]
list3 = [24, 26, 54, 48]
print(merge_sorted_list(list1, list2, list3))
```
This will output: `[4, 5, 11, 15, 19, 20, 24, 24, 25, 25, 26, 29, 48, 54, 56, 110, 154, 233]` which is the merged and sorted list. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting operation. If the input lists are already sorted, a more efficient solution would be to use a merge operation with a time complexity of O(n). However, since the problem statement does not guarantee that the input lists are sorted, the `sorted` function is a good solution.
