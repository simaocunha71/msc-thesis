This function takes three sorted lists as input and returns a single sorted list that contains all the elements from the input lists. It does this by iterating through the input lists and adding the smallest element to the result list at each step. This is done using three indices, one for each input list, which are incremented whenever the smallest element is found. Finally, any remaining elements in the input lists are added to the result list. The function returns the result list once all elements have been processed. The unit test provided ensures that the function works correctly by comparing the output with the expected result. 





Note: This function assumes that the input lists are already sorted in ascending order. If the input lists are not sorted, you would need to sort them first before merging them. The unit test provided also assumes that the input lists are sorted, so it will fail if the input lists are not sorted.
