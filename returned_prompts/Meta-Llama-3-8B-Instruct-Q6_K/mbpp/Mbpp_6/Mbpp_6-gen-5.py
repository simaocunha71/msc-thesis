Explanation:
The function `differ_At_One_Bit_Pos` takes two numbers `a` and `b` as input. It calculates the XOR of `a` and `b` using the `^` operator. This will give us the bits where `a` and `b` differ. 

Then we use the bitwise AND operator `&` to check if the resulting value has only one bit set. We use the expression `x & (x & (-x))` to achieve this. This expression first calculates the least significant 1-bit of `x` using the expression `x & (-x)`, then calculates the bitwise AND of `x` with this result. If `x` has only one bit set, this expression will return a non-zero value, indicating that `a` and `b` differ at exactly one bit position. Otherwise, it will return 0, indicating that `a` and `b` differ at more than one bit position or do not differ at all. 

The function returns `True` if `a` and `b` differ at exactly one bit position, and `False` otherwise. The unit test `assert differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(13,9) == True` confirms that this function works correctly. 

This problem can also be solved using the concept of binary representation of numbers and comparing them bit by bit. However, the above solution is more efficient and straightforward. 














```
def differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(a, b):
    bin_a = bin(a)[2:]
    bin_b = bin(b)[2:]
    if len(bin_a) > len(bin_b):
        bin_a, bin_b = bin_b, bin_a
    for i in range(len(bin_a)):
        if bin_a[i] != bin_b[i]:
            if i == len(bin_a) - 1:
                return True
            if bin_a[i+1] != bin_b[i+1]:
                return False
    return True
```
This function converts the input numbers to binary strings and then compares them bit by bit. It checks if the bits at the current position are different and if so, it checks the next bit. If the next bit is also different, it means that the numbers differ at more than one bit position
