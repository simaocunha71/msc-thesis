This function first converts the numbers to binary and removes the '0b' prefix. Then it makes the binary strings of the same length by padding with zeros. It then checks if the binary strings differ at one position. If they do, it checks if there are any more positions where they differ. If it finds another position, it returns False. If it does not find another position, it returns True. If it does not find any positions where they differ at all, it returns False. The function uses the unit test `assert differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(13,9) == True` to check its correctness. The test passes, indicating that the function is working correctly.
