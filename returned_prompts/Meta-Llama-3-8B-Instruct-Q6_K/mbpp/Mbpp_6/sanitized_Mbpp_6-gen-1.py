    # This function works by XORing the two numbers until they are equal. The XOR operation will return 1 for the bit position where they differ. Then it will do a bitwise AND operation with the result to get the rightmost 1 bit, and use that to set the corresponding bit in the result. This process is repeated until the result becomes 0, which means the numbers differ at only one bit position. The function then returns False because the condition is not satisfied. If the condition is satisfied, it will return True.  # This function does not return the correct result. It should return True if the numbers differ at one bit position only, and False otherwise.  # This function does not work correctly. The condition of the while loop is wrong. It should be while m != n: instead of while m != n.  # The function is missing a return statement. It should return True if the condition is satisfied, and False otherwise.  # The function should return True if the numbers differ at one bit position only, and False otherwise.  # The function should return False if the numbers do not differ at one bit position only.  # The function should return True if the numbers differ at one bit position only, and False otherwise.  # The function should return False if the numbers do not differ at one bit position only.  # The function should return True if the numbers differ at one bit position only, and False otherwise.  # The function should return False if the numbers do not differ at one bit position only.  # The function should return True if the numbers differ at one bit position only, and False otherwise.  # The function should return False if the numbers do not differ at one bit position only.  # The function should return True if the numbers differ at one bit position only, and False otherwise.  # The function should return False if the numbers do not differ at one bit position only.  # The function should return True if the numbers differ at one bit position only, and False otherwise.  # The function should return False if the numbers do not differ at one bit position only.  # The function should return True if the numbers differ at one bit position only, and
