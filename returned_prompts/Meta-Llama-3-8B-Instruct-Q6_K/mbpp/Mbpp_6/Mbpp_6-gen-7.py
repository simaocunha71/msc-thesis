The function `differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(a, b)` takes two integers as input and checks whether they differ at one bit position only. It first converts the numbers to binary strings, then checks if the strings have the same length. If not, it adjusts the longer string to be the same length as the shorter one. Then it iterates over the binary strings, checking if there is any position where the bits differ. If it finds such a position, it returns `True`. If it doesn't find any such position, it returns `False`. The unit test `assert differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(13,9) == True` ensures that the function works correctly.
