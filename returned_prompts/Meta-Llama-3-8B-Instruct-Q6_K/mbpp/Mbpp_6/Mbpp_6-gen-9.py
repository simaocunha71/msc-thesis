Explanation: 

The provided unit test suggests that the function should return True if the two numbers differ at one bit position only, and False otherwise. 

To solve this problem, we can convert the input integers to binary strings, then iterate over the binary strings to check if the bits are different. 

If more than one different bit is found, we return False. If exactly one different bit is found, we return True. 

If the binary strings have different lengths, we return False, as this would mean the numbers have a different number of bits. 

The function uses the bin() function to convert the integers to binary strings, and then removes the '0b' prefix using string slicing. 

The function also uses a counter to keep track of the number of different bits found. 

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of bits in the input integers, as we are iterating over the binary strings once. The space complexity is O(1), as we are using a constant amount of space to store the binary strings and the counter. 





```python
def differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(a, b):
    # Convert the integers to binary and remove the '0b' prefix
    bin_a = bin(a)[2:]
    bin_b = bin(b)[2:]
    
    # Check if the lengths of the binary strings are different
    if len(bin_a) != len(bin_b):
        return False
    
    # Initialize a counter for the different bits
    diff_count = 0
    
    # Iterate over the binary strings
