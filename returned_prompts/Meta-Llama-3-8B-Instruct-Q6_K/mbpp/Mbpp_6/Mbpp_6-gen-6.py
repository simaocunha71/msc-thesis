The problem is asking you to create a function that takes two integers as input and returns True if they differ at only one bit position, and False otherwise.

Here is a Python solution for this problem:

```Python
def differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(a, b):
    while a != b:
        a = a ^ (a & -a)
        b = b ^ (b & -b)
    return False
```

This function works by continuously performing bitwise XOR operation on the input numbers until they become equal. In this process, it keeps changing the bits that are different between the two numbers until only one bit remains different, which is the bit that differs at one bit position only. The function then returns False as it has found the bit that differs at one bit position only. If the numbers do not differ at one bit position only, the function will return False. 

This function works because XOR operation returns 1 if the corresponding bits are different, and 0 if they are the same. The expression `a & -a` is used to find the least significant bit that is 1 in `a`. The expression `a ^ (a & -a)` is used to flip the least significant bit that is 1 in `a`. This process continues until `a` and `b` are equal. The function returns False if the numbers do not differ at one bit position only. 

The unit test `assert differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(13,9) == True` suggests that the function should return True if the numbers differ at one bit position only, and False otherwise. This is why the function returns False as soon as it finds the bit that differs at one bit position only. If the numbers do not differ at one bit position only, the function will return False.
