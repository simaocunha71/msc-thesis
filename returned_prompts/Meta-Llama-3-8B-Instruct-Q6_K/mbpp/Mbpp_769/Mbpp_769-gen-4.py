```
def Diff(list1, list2):
    return (list(set(list1) - set(list2)) + list(set(list2) - set(list1)))
```
This function calculates the difference between two lists. It converts the lists to sets, subtracts one set from the other, and then converts the result back to a list. The result is the elements that are in the first list but not the second, plus the elements that are in the second list but not the first. The order of the elements in the result is not guaranteed. 

The unit test `assert (Diff([10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40], [25, 40, 35])) == [10, 20, 30, 15]` suggests that the order of the elements in the result should be the same as their order in the first list. In that case, the function should be modified to sort the result before returning it. 

Here is the modified function:
```
def Diff(list1, list2):
    return sorted(list(set(list1) - set(list2)) + list(set(list2) - set(list1)))
```
This function will return the difference between the two lists in the order of the elements in the first list. 

However, the problem statement does not specify what to do if there are duplicate elements in the lists. The function will treat duplicate elements as distinct. If the problem requires duplicate elements to be treated as identical, the function would need to be modified to remove duplicates before calculating the difference. 

Here is the modified function that removes duplicates:
```
def Diff(list1, list2):
    return sorted(list(set(list1) - set(list2)) + list(set(list2) - set(list1)))
```
This function will return the difference between the two lists in the order of the elements in the first list, treating duplicate elements as distinct. If the problem requires duplicate elements to be treated as identical, the function would need to be modified to sort the result before returning it. 

Here is the modified function that treats duplicate elements as identical:
```
def Diff(list1, list2):
    set1 = set(list1)
    set2 = set(list2)
    return sorted([x for x in set1 if x not in set2] + [x for x in set2 if x not in set1])
```
