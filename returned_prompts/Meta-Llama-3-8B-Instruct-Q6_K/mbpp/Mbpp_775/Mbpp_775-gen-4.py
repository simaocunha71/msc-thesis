The function `odd_position` iterates over the list with a step of 2, starting from the first odd index (1). For each element at an odd index, it checks if the number is even (by using the modulus operator `%`). If it finds an even number, it immediately returns `False`. If it doesn't find any even numbers, it returns `True`. 

The unit test `assert odd_position([2,1,4,3,6,7,6,3]) == True` suggests that the function should return `True` if every odd index contains an odd number. Therefore, the function returns `True` as soon as it finds an even number at an odd index. 

This function assumes that the input list is non-empty. If the list can be empty, you may want to add a check at the beginning of the function to return `True` for an empty list. 

This function also assumes that the input list contains only integers. If the list can contain non-integer values, you may want to add a check to handle those values. 

This function is case-sensitive and only checks for odd and even numbers in the list. It does not check for any other conditions. 

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input list. This is because it needs to iterate over the list once. The space complexity is O(1), which means it uses a constant amount of space. This is because it only uses a fixed amount of space to store the loop variables and the return value.
