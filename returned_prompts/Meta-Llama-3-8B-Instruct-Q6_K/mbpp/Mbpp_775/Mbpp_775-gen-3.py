This function checks every odd index in the list. If it finds an even number at any of these positions, it immediately returns False. If it checks all odd positions and doesn't find any even numbers, it returns True. The unit test provided, `assert odd_position([2,1,4,3,6,7,6,3]) == True`, ensures that the function works correctly. For example, the list [2,1,4,3,6,7,6,3] has odd numbers at odd positions (1, 3, 5, 7), so the function returns True. 

The function uses list indexing and the modulus operator to check the parity of each number. The range function is used to generate the indices of the odd positions. The `range(1, len(lst), 2)` expression generates the indices 1, 3, 5, 7, etc., up to the length of the list. The `len(lst)` function returns the length of the list, and the `2` is the step size, meaning that the indices are incremented by 2 each time. The `for` loop iterates over these indices, and for each index, it checks whether the corresponding value in the list is even (using the modulus operator). If it finds an even value, it returns False. If it checks all the odd positions and doesn't find any even values, it returns True. 

The function is case-insensitive, meaning that it treats uppercase and lowercase letters as the same character. It also ignores non-alphabetic characters, treating them as if they were spaces. The function uses the `str` function to convert the input to a string, and then uses list comprehension to create a list of the characters in the string. The `for` loop iterates over the characters in the list, and for each character, it checks whether the character is an uppercase letter or a lowercase letter. If it finds an uppercase letter, it adds the corresponding lowercase letter to the result list. If it finds a lowercase letter, it adds the corresponding uppercase letter to the result list. If it finds any non-alphabetic characters, it ignores them. The function returns the result list. 

The function is not very efficient for large lists, because it uses
