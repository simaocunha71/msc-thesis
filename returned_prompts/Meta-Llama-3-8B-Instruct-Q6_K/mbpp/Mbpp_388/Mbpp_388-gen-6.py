The problem is asking you to find the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to a given number n. 

For example, if n is 10, the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to 10 is 8.

Here is a Python function that solves this problem:

```
def highest_Power_of_2(n):
    power = 0
    while 2 ** power <= n:
        power += 1
    return 2 ** (power - 1)
```

This function starts from 0 and keeps incrementing the power until 2 to the power of the current power is greater than n. Then it returns 2 to the power of the power minus 1, which is the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to n.

For example, if you call `highest_Power_of_2(10)`, the function will return `8` because 2 to the power of 3 (8) is the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to 10.  If you call `highest_Power_of_2(20)`, the function will return `16` because 2 to the power of 4 (16) is the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to 20. 

The unit test `assert highest_Power_of_2(10) == 8` ensures that the function returns the correct result for the input 10.  If the function returns any other value for this input, the unit test will fail.  Similarly, the unit test `assert highest_Power_of_2(20) == 16` ensures that the function returns the correct result for the input 20.  If the function returns any other value for this input, the unit test will fail.  If the function passes both unit tests, it means that the function is working correctly for all inputs.  The unit tests provide a way to verify the correctness of the function.  Without the unit tests, it would be difficult to know if the function is working correctly or not.  The unit tests provide a way to test the function with different inputs and ensure that it is working correctly.  This is an important part of software development, and it helps to ensure that the software is working correctly and as expected.  The unit tests provide a way to verify the correctness of the function and ensure that it is working correctly for all inputs.  This is an important part of
