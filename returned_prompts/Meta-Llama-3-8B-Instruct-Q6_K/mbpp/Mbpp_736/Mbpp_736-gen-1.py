The problem is asking to write a function that finds the index where a specified value should be inserted in a sorted list to maintain the sorted order. The function should return the index of the leftmost point where the value can be inserted.

In the given unit test, `left_insertion([1,2,4,5],6)` should return `4` because `6` should be inserted at the end of the list to maintain the sorted order.

Here is the Python solution for the problem:

```python
def left_insertion(arr, value):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] < value:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return left
```



This function uses a binary search algorithm to find the leftmost point where the value can be inserted. It starts by considering the middle element of the list. If the middle element is less than the value, it moves the left pointer to the middle + 1. If the middle element is greater than or equal to the value, it moves the right pointer to the middle - 1. The process is repeated until the left and right pointers meet, at which point the left pointer indicates the leftmost point where the value can be inserted.  The function returns the left pointer as the index of the leftmost point.  If the value is not found in the list, the function returns the length of the list, which is the index where the value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order.  In the given unit test, `left_insertion([1,2,4,5],6)` returns `4` because `6` should be inserted at the end of the list to maintain the sorted order.  The function works correctly for both found and not found values in the list.  It also works for lists with duplicate values.  It has a time complexity of O(log n) and a space complexity of O(1), where n is the number of elements in the list.  The function is efficient and accurate for large lists.  It can be used to find the leftmost point where a value should be inserted in a sorted list.  It can be used in a variety of applications such as searching, sorting, and manipulating lists.  It is a useful function to have in a programmer's toolkit.  It is easy
