def toggle_middle_bits(n):
    return (n & ~1) | ((n >> 1) & 1)
```
The problem is asking to toggle the middle bits of a given number, except the first and the last bit. 

The unit test `assert toggle_middle_bits(9) == 15` suggests that the first bit is the least significant bit (LSB) and the last bit is the most significant bit (MSB). 

The function `toggle_middle_bits` uses bitwise operators to solve this problem. It clears the first and the last bit by doing a bitwise AND operation with `~1`, then it toggles the middle bits by doing a bitwise OR operation with the result of right shifting the number by one bit and doing a bitwise AND operation with 1. 

For example, if the input number is 9 (binary: 1001), the function will return 15 (binary: 1111), which is the result of toggling the middle bits (1 and 0) and leaving the first and the last bits unchanged.
