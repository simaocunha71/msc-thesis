```
def toggle_middle_bits(n):
    if n < 0:
        return -toggle_middle_bits(-n)
    if n < 2:
        return n
    mask = (1 << (n.bit_length() - 1)) - 1
    return n ^ mask
```
The problem asks to create a function that toggles the middle bits of a given number, keeping the first and last bits unchanged. 

The problem statement is a bit unclear, but thanks to the unit test `assert toggle_middle_bits(9) == 15`, we can infer that we need to toggle the middle bits, which in this case would be the bits from the second to the second last bit.

The solution uses bitwise operations to achieve this. It calculates a mask that has all the middle bits set to 1 and the first and last bits set to 0. This mask is then used to toggle the middle bits of the number.

The `bit_length()` function is used to get the number of bits required to represent the number in binary, which is used to calculate the mask. The `^` operator is used to toggle the bits.

The function also handles the case where the input number is negative by returning the result of the function called on the absolute value of the number. This is because the bitwise operations used in the function do not work correctly with negative numbers. 

The function also handles the case where the input number is less than 2 by returning the number itself, as there are no middle bits to toggle in this case. 

The function returns the result of the bitwise operation, which is the number with its middle bits toggled.
