```
def check_occurences(tuples_list):
    occurrence_dict = {}
    for t in tuples_list:
        if t in occurrence_dict:
            occurrence_dict[t] += 1
        else:
            occurrence_dict[t] = 1
    return occurrence_dict
```





The programming problem is asking to create a function that takes a list of tuples as input and returns a dictionary. This dictionary should map each unique tuple to the number of times it appears in the input list.

The given unit test suggests that the input list contains tuples with two elements each. For example, the test case `assert check_occurences([(3, 1), (1, 3), (2, 5), (5, 2), (6, 3)] ) == {(1, 3): 2, (2, 5): 2, (3, 6): 1}` shows that the function should return a dictionary where the keys are the unique tuples from the input list and the values are the number of times each tuple appears in the list.

Here's a Python function that solves this problem:

```python
def check_occurences(tuples_list):
    occurrence_dict = {}
    for t in tuples_list:
        if t in occurrence_dict:
            occurrence_dict[t] += 1
        else:
            occurrence_dict[t] = 1
    return occurrence_dict
```

This function initializes an empty dictionary `occurrence_dict`. It then iterates over each tuple `t` in the input list `tuples_list`. If `t` is already a key in `occurrence_dict`, the function increments the corresponding value by 1. If `t` is not a key in `occurrence_dict`, the function adds `t` as a key with a value of 1. Finally, the function returns `occurrence_dict`.
