def sum_average(n):
    sum_of_n = n * (n + 1) // 2
    average = sum_of_n / n

The problem is asking you to create a function that calculates the sum and average of the first n natural numbers. 

The formula to calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers is n * (n + 1) / 2. 

The average is the sum divided by n. 

This function takes an integer n as an argument and returns a tuple containing the sum and average of the first n natural numbers. 

The unit test `assert sum_average(10)==(55, 5.5)` helps to clarify the problem by showing that the function should return the sum and average as a tuple. 

The function is implemented using the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers and the definition of average. 

For example, if you call `sum_average(10)`, the function will return `(55, 5.5)`, which is the sum and average of the first 10 natural numbers.
