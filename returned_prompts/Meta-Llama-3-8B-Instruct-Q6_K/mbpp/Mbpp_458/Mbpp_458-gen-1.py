```
def rectangle_area(length, width):
    return length * width
```


This function takes two parameters, length and width, which are used to calculate the area of a rectangle. The area is calculated by multiplying the length and width, and the result is returned. 

The unit test `assert rectangle_area(10,20)==200` ensures that the function works correctly for a rectangle with a length of 10 and a width of 20, which has an area of 200. 

Note: The unit test is used to verify that the function is working as expected. It checks if the output of the function is equal to the expected result. If the output is not equal to the expected result, the test will fail. This helps to ensure that the function is working correctly. 

In this case, the unit test is used to verify that the function is correctly calculating the area of a rectangle. The test checks if the area of a rectangle with a length of 10 and a width of 20 is equal to 200. If the function is working correctly, the test will pass. If the function is not working correctly, the test will fail, indicating that there is an error in the function.
