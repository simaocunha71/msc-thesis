```
def rectangle_area(length, width):
    return length * width
```


This function takes two arguments, the length and the width of the rectangle, and returns their product, which is the area of the rectangle. The unit test `assert rectangle_area(10,20)==200` ensures that the function works correctly for a rectangle with a length of 10 and a width of 20.
