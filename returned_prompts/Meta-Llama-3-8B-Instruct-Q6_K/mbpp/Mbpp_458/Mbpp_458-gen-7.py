Python program to find the area of a rectangle.
The function `rectangle_area` takes two parameters: the length and the width of the rectangle. It returns the area of the rectangle, which is the product of the length and the width.

The unit test `assert rectangle_area(10,20)==200` checks if the function is working correctly. The function should return `200` when the length is `10` and the width is `20`.

The `print(rectangle_area(10,20))` statement is used to test the function. It should print `200`.
