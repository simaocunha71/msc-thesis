```
def rectangle_area(length, width):
    return length * width
```



The problem is asking to create a function that calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width. 

The unit test provided, `assert rectangle_area(10,20)==200`, helps to clarify the problem by showing that the function should take two arguments, the length and width of the rectangle, and return their product.

Here's the solution in Python:
```
def rectangle_area(length, width):
    return length * width
```



This function takes two arguments, `length` and `width`, and returns their product, which is the area of the rectangle. The unit test `assert rectangle_area(10,20)==200` passes, confirming that the function works correctly.
