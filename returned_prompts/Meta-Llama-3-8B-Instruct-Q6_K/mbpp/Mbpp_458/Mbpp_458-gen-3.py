```
def rectangle_area(length, width):
    return length * width
```


This function takes the length and width of a rectangle as input and returns the area of the rectangle. The area is calculated by multiplying the length and width. The unit test `assert rectangle_area(10,20)==200` ensures that the function is working correctly. It checks if the area of a rectangle with a length of 10 and a width of 20 is indeed 200.
