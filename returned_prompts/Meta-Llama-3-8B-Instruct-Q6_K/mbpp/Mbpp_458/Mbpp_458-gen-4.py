```
def rectangle_area(length, width):
    return length * width
```
The problem is asking to write a function that calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width. 

The unit test `assert rectangle_area(10,20)==200` suggests that the function should take two parameters, the length and the width of the rectangle, and return the area which is the product of the length and width.

Here's a simple Python function that accomplishes this:

```
def rectangle_area(length, width):
    return length * width
```  # Corrected syntax
```
This function takes two parameters, `length` and `width`, and returns the product of these two values, which represents the area of the rectangle. The unit test `assert rectangle_area(10,20)==200` confirms that this function works as expected.  # Corrected syntax
```  # Corrected syntax
```
This function takes two parameters, `length` and `width`, and returns the product of these two values, which represents the area of the rectangle. The unit test `assert rectangle_area(10,20)==200` confirms that this function works as expected.  # Corrected syntax
```  # Corrected syntax
