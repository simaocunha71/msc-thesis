```
def rectangle_area(length, width):
    return length * width
```


Note: The unit test `assert rectangle_area(10,20)==200` suggests that the function takes two parameters, the length and the width of the rectangle, and returns their product, which is the area of the rectangle. 

The unit test is asserting that the area of a rectangle with a length of 10 and a width of 20 is indeed 200, which is the correct result. 

This solution does not take into account any potential error handling for invalid input, such as negative or non-numeric input. For a more robust solution, you might want to add some error checking code to handle such cases.  For example, you could check if the input is a positive number before calculating the area.  Here is an updated version of the function that includes some basic error checking:

```
def rectangle_area(length, width):
    if not isinstance(length, (int, float)) or not isinstance(width, (int, float)):
        return "Error: Both length and width must be numbers."
    if length <= 0 or width <= 0:
        return "Error: Both length and width must be positive numbers."
    return length * width
```


This updated function will return an error message if either the length or the width is not a positive number.  It will also return an error message if either the length or the width is not a number.  This can help prevent potential errors and make the function more robust.  However, this is just a basic example, and you might want to add more advanced error handling depending on your specific requirements.  For example, you could add a check to see if the input is within a certain range, or you could add a check to see if the input is a valid rectangle (i.e., the length and width are not equal).  The specific error handling you choose will depend on your specific requirements and the specific use case for your function.  For example, you might want to add a check to see if the input is within a certain range:

```
def rectangle_area(length, width):
    if not isinstance(length, (int, float)) or not isinstance(width, (int, float)):
        return "Error: Both length and width must be numbers."
    if length <= 0 or width <= 0:
        return "Error: Both length and width must be positive numbers."
    if length > 1000 or width > 1000:
        return
