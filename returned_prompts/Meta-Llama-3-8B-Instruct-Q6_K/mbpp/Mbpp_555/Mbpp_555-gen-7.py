    sum_of_cubes = sum(i**3 for i in range(1, n+1))

This function calculates the sum of the cubes of the first n natural numbers using a generator expression and the built-in sum function. It then calculates the sum of the first n natural numbers using the built-in sum function and range function. Finally, it returns the difference between the two sums. The unit test `assert difference(3) == 30` ensures that the function is working correctly for the input n = 3. 

The unit test `assert difference(3) == 30` is passed because the sum of the cubes of the first 3 natural numbers is 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 8 + 27 = 36, and the sum of the first 3 natural numbers is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. The difference between these two sums is 36 - 6 = 30.
