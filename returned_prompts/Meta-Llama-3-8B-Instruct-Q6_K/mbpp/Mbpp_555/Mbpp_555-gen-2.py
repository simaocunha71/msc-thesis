The function `difference(n)` calculates the difference between the sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers and the sum of the first n natural numbers. It uses the built-in Python functions `sum()` and `range()` to calculate the sums. The `sum()` function is used to add up the elements of an iterable, and `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers. The difference is calculated by subtracting the sum of the first n natural numbers from the sum of the cubes of the first n natural numbers. The function takes an integer `n` as input, and returns the difference as a result. For example, `difference(3)` returns `30`, as expected.  The unit test `assert difference(3) == 30` confirms this result.  This function is efficient and accurate, as it uses built-in Python functions and does not require any additional computations.  It can be used to calculate the difference for any positive integer `n`.  For example, `difference(10)` would return the difference for the first 10 natural numbers.  The function can also be used in other mathematical calculations, such as calculating the sum of squares or the sum of powers of numbers.  It is a versatile and useful tool for working with sequences and series of numbers.  The function is easy to understand and use, and it provides accurate results for any input value.  It is a reliable and efficient function that can be used in a variety of mathematical and computational applications.  It is also easy to modify and extend to calculate other mathematical quantities, such as the sum of squares or the sum of powers of numbers.  The function is a valuable tool for anyone working with sequences and series of numbers.
