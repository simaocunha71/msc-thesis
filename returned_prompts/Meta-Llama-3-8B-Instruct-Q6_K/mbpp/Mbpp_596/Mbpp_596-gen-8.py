```
import sys
def tuple_size(t):
    return sys.getsizeof(t)
```


This problem asks to write a function that calculates the size in bytes of a given tuple. The size of the tuple is determined by the memory usage of the tuple, which is obtained using the built-in `sys.getsizeof()` function.

The unit test `assert tuple_size(("A", 1, "B", 2, "C", 3) ) == sys.getsizeof(("A", 1, "B", 2, "C", 3))` ensures that the function correctly calculates the size of a tuple.

Here is the solution in Python:

```
import sys
def tuple_size(t):
    return sys.getsizeof(t)
```

This function takes a tuple `t` as input and returns its size in bytes, which is obtained using `sys.getsizeof(t)`. This function works correctly for any tuple, regardless of its contents.
