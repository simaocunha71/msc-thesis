```
import sys

def tuple_size(t):
    return sys.getsizeof(t)
```


This problem asks you to write a function that calculates the size in bytes of a given tuple. The size is calculated using the `sys.getsizeof()` function in Python, which returns the size of the object in bytes.

The unit test `assert tuple_size(("A", 1, "B", 2, "C", 3) ) == sys.getsizeof(("A", 1, "B", 2, "C", 3))` helps to clarify the problem by providing an example of how the function should work.

The solution is a simple function that takes a tuple as input and returns the size of the tuple in bytes using `sys.getsizeof()`. This function does not require any complex calculations, just a straightforward call to `sys.getsizeof()`.
