```
import sys
def tuple_size(t):
    return sys.getsizeof(t)
```
This problem is asking to write a function that takes a tuple as input and returns its size in bytes. 

The unit test provided suggests that the size should be calculated using the `sys.getsizeof()` function from the `sys` module, which returns the size in bytes of the given object.

Here's a simple function that does that:
```
import sys
def tuple_size(t):
    return sys.getsizeof(t)
```
This function takes a tuple `t` as input, and returns its size in bytes using `sys.getsizeof(t)`. The `sys.getsizeof()` function returns the size in bytes of the given object, which in this case is the tuple. 

For example, if you call `tuple_size(("A", 1, "B", 2, "C", 3))`, it will return the size in bytes of the tuple `("A", 1, "B", 2, "C", 3)`. 

Note that this function does not recursively calculate the size of the tuple, it simply returns the size of the tuple itself. If you want to calculate the total size of the tuple and its elements, you would need to recursively calculate the size of each element and add them up. However, this is not what the problem is asking for. The problem is asking for the size of the tuple itself, not the total size of the tuple and its elements.
