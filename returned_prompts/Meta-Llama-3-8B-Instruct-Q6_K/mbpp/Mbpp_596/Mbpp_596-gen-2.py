```
import sys
def tuple_size(t):
    return sys.getsizeof(t)
```
The task is to create a function that calculates the size in bytes of a given tuple. The function should take a tuple as an argument and return its size in bytes.

The provided unit test `assert tuple_size(("A", 1, "B", 2, "C", 3) ) == sys.getsizeof(("A", 1, "B", 2, "C", 3))` suggests that the function should use the built-in `sys.getsizeof()` function to get the size of the tuple.

Here is the solution:
```
import sys
def tuple_size(t):
    return sys.getsizeof(t)
```
This function takes a tuple `t` as an argument and returns its size in bytes using the `sys.getsizeof()` function. This function is a part of the Python standard library and returns the size of the object in bytes. In this case, it returns the size of the tuple `t` in bytes. The function does not need to iterate over the elements of the tuple or do any complex calculations, it simply returns the size of the tuple as returned by `sys.getsizeof()`.
