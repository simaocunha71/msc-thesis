```
import sys

def tuple_size(t):
    return sys.getsizeof(t)
```
This problem asks to write a function that calculates the size in bytes of a given tuple. The function should return the size of the tuple in bytes.

The unit test provided helps to clarify the problem by giving an example of how the function should work. The test checks that the function returns the same value as `sys.getsizeof(("A", 1, "B", 2, "C", 3))`, which is the size of the tuple in bytes.

The solution to this problem is to use the built-in `sys.getsizeof` function, which returns the size of an object in bytes. This function can be used to find the size of the tuple. The function `tuple_size` takes a tuple `t` as input and returns the size of `t` in bytes.

Here is the solution:
```
import sys

def tuple_size(t):
    return sys.getsizeof(t)
```


This function will correctly calculate the size of the given tuple in bytes and return it. The unit test provided ensures that this function works correctly.
