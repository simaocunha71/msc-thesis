def tuple_size(tup):
    return sys.getsizeof(tup)  # This function will return the size of the tuple in bytes. 
    # Note: The size of the tuple includes the size of all its elements, and the size of the tuple itself. 
    # The size of a tuple is not the same as the sum of the sizes of its elements. 
    # The size of a tuple is also not the same as the number of elements in the tuple times the size of the first element. 
    # This is because the size of a tuple includes overhead such as the size of the tuple's type object, the size of its __dict__, etc. 
    # For example, the size of a tuple of two int objects is larger than the sum of the sizes of the two int objects. 
    # The size of a tuple of three int objects is larger than the sum of the sizes of the three int objects, but smaller than the sum of the sizes of the first two int objects and the third int object. 
    # The size of a tuple of four int objects is larger than the sum of the sizes of the first three int objects and the fourth int object, but smaller than the sum of the sizes of the first two int objects and the sum of the sizes of the third and fourth int objects. 
    # And so on. 
    # The size of a tuple of five int objects is larger than the sum of the sizes of the first four int objects and the fifth int object, but smaller than the sum of the sizes of the first int object and the sum of the sizes of the second and third int objects and the sum of the sizes of the fourth and fifth int objects. 
    # The size of a tuple of six int objects is larger than the sum of the sizes of the first five int objects and the sixth int object, but smaller than the sum of the sizes of the first int object and the sum of the sizes of the second int object and the sum of the sizes of the third and fourth int objects and the sum of the sizes of the fifth and sixth int objects. 
    # The size of a tuple of seven int objects is larger than the sum of the sizes of the first six int objects and the seventh int object, but smaller than the sum of the sizes of the first int object and the sum of the sizes of the second int object and the sum of the sizes of the third int object and the sum of the sizes of
