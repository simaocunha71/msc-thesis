```
import sys

def tuple_size(t):
    return sys.getsizeof(t)
```





This problem is asking you to write a function that finds the size in bytes of a given tuple. The size of the tuple includes the size of the tuple itself, as well as the sizes of the elements it contains.

The unit test provided helps clarify the problem by showing that we need to use the `sys.getsizeof()` function to get the size of the tuple. This function returns the size in bytes of an object.

Here's a simple function that solves the problem:
```
import sys

def tuple_size(t):
    return sys.getsizeof(t)
```
This function takes a tuple `t` as input, and returns the size of `t` in bytes. The size is obtained by calling `sys.getsizeof(t)`, which returns the size of the tuple itself, as well as the sizes of the elements it contains.
