import sys

def tuple_size(t):
    return sys.getsizeof(t)
```
The task is to write a function that calculates the size in bytes of a given tuple. The size of a tuple includes the size of its elements and the overhead of the tuple itself.

In Python, the built-in `sys.getsizeof()` function can be used to get the size of an object in bytes. Therefore, the solution is a simple function that takes a tuple as input and returns the result of `sys.getsizeof()` on that tuple.

The unit test `assert tuple_size(("A", 1, "B", 2, "C", 3) ) == sys.getsizeof(("A", 1, "B", 2, "C", 3))` ensures that the function works correctly. It checks if the size of the tuple returned by the function is equal to the size of the same tuple calculated using `sys.getsizeof()`. If the function is correct, this test will pass. Otherwise, it will fail, indicating that there is an error in the function.
