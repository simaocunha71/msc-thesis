def tuple_size(tup: tuple) -> int:
    return sys.getsizeof(tup)  # returns the size in bytes of the given tuple
    # Note: This function returns the size of the tuple in bytes, including the size of the elements within the tuple. The size of the tuple itself is not included. The size of the elements within the tuple are included, which are the size of the objects themselves, not the size of the objects within the objects. For example, if the tuple is ('A', 1, 'B', 2, 'C', 3), the size of 'A', 'B', 'C' are the size of strings, and the size of 1, 2, 3 are the size of integers. The size of the strings and integers are included in the size of the tuple. If you want to get the size of the elements within the elements, you need to recursively call this function. However, this is not recommended as it could cause a stack overflow for large tuples.  # This is the default implementation, but it's not recommended as it could cause a stack overflow for large tuples.  # You should use a better method for large tuples.  # For example, you could use a generator to generate the size of the elements within the tuple, or you could use a library that can handle large tuples.  # For example, you could use the 'pandas' library, which has a function to calculate the size of a tuple.  # The 'pandas' library is a powerful library that can handle large tuples and other data structures.  # It's a good idea to use the 'pandas' library if you're working with large tuples.  # You can install the 'pandas' library with pip:  # pip install pandas
    # You can use the 'pandas' library like this:  # import pandas as pd  # pd.getsizeof(tup)  # This will return the size of the tuple in bytes, including the size of the elements within the tuple.
    # You can also use the 'sys' library to get the size of the tuple:  # import sys  # sys.getsizeof(tup)  # This will return the size of the tuple in bytes, including the size of the elements within the tuple.
    # You can also use a generator to generate the size of the elements within the tuple:  # def tuple_size(tup: tuple) -> int
