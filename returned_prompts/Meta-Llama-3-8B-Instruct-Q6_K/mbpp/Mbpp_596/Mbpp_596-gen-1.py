```
import sys

def tuple_size(t):
    return sys.getsizeof(t)
```


The problem is asking to write a function that finds the size in bytes of a given tuple. However, the problem statement seems to be missing some information, as it doesn't specify which elements of the tuple to consider when calculating its size.

Fortunately, the provided unit test clarifies the problem. The unit test `assert tuple_size(("A", 1, "B", 2, "C", 3) ) == sys.getsizeof(("A", 1, "B", 2, "C", 3))` suggests that we should consider the size of the entire tuple, including all its elements, and return that size.

In Python, we can use the `sys.getsizeof()` function to get the size in bytes of an object. This function returns the size of the object in bytes, including all its contents. Therefore, we can use this function to solve the problem.

Here is the solution:
```
import sys

def tuple_size(t):
    return sys.getsizeof(t)
```
This function takes a tuple `t` as input and returns its size in bytes. The size is calculated using the `sys.getsizeof()` function, which returns the size of the tuple in bytes, including all its elements. The function can be used to find the size of any tuple in Python.
