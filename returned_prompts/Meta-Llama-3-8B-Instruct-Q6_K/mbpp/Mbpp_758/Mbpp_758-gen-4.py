```
def unique_sublists(lst):
    count_dict = {}
    for item in lst:
        item_tuple = tuple(item)
        if item_tuple in count_dict:
            count_dict[item_tuple] += 1
        else:
            count_dict[item_tuple] = 1
    return count_dict
```
The provided unit test suggests that the function should count the number of occurrences of each list in the given list, and return a dictionary where the keys are tuples representing the lists and the values are the counts of each list. The function iterates over the given list, converts each sublist to a tuple, and updates the count in the dictionary. If the tuple is not already in the dictionary, it is added with a count of 1. The function then returns the dictionary. 

Here's how you can use this function:

```
lst = [[1, 3], [5, 7], [1, 3], [13, 15, 17], [5, 7], [9, 11]]
print(unique_sublists(lst))  # Output: {(1, 3): 2, (5, 7): 2, (13, 15, 17): 1, (9, 11): 1}
``` 





The unit test provided ensures that the function works correctly. It checks if the function returns the expected output for the given input. The test case is:

```
assert unique_sublists([[1, 3], [5, 7], [1, 3], [13, 15, 17], [5, 7], [9, 11]])=={(1, 3): 2, (5, 7): 2, (13, 15, 17): 1, (9, 11): 1}
```

This test case checks if the function returns the expected output for the given input. If the function returns the expected output, the test passes. If the function returns a different output, the test fails.
