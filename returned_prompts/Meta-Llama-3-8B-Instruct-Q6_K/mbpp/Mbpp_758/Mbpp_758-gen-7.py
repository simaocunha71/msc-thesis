```
def unique_sublists(lst):
    from collections import defaultdict
    d = defaultdict(int)
    for sub in lst:
        sub_tuple = tuple(sub)
        d[sub_tuple] += 1
    return dict(d)
```





The provided unit test `assert unique_sublists([[1, 3], [5, 7], [1, 3], [13, 15, 17], [5, 7], [9, 11]] )=={(1, 3): 2, (5, 7): 2, (13, 15, 17): 1, (9, 11): 1}` helps to understand the problem better. It indicates that the function should count the occurrences of each sublist in the main list and return a dictionary where each sublist is converted to a tuple and the value of such tuple is the number of its occurrences. 

The problem can be solved by using a dictionary from the collections module with a default value of 0. The function iterates over the main list, converts each sublist to a tuple, and increments its count in the dictionary. Finally, it returns the dictionary as a regular dictionary.

Here is the solution:

```
from collections import defaultdict

def unique_sublists(lst):
    d = defaultdict(int)
    for sub in lst:
        sub_tuple = tuple(sub)
        d[sub_tuple] += 1
    return dict(d)
```

This function works by initializing an empty dictionary `d` with default values of 0. It then iterates over the main list `lst`. For each sublist `sub`, it converts the sublist to a tuple `sub_tuple` and increments its count in the dictionary `d`. Finally, it returns the dictionary `d` as a regular dictionary. The default dictionary from the collections module is used to avoid having to check if the tuple is already a key in the dictionary before incrementing its count. If the tuple is not already a key, the default value of 0 will be used, and the count will be incremented. If the tuple is already a key, its count will be incremented by 1.
