```
def unique_sublists(lst):
    sublists = [tuple(sublist) for sublist in lst]
    return {sublist: sublists.count(sublist) for sublist in set(sublists)}
```

The function `unique_sublists` takes a list of lists as input. It first converts each sublist to a tuple using a list comprehension. Then, it creates a dictionary where the keys are the unique tuples and the values are the counts of each tuple in the list. The `set` function is used to get the unique tuples, and the `count` method is used to count the occurrences of each tuple. The function returns the dictionary.  The unit test `assert unique_sublists([[1, 3], [5, 7], [1, 3], [13, 15, 17], [5, 7], [9, 11]] )=={(1, 3): 2, (5, 7): 2, (13, 15, 17): 1, (9, 11): 1}` ensures that the function works correctly.  It checks that the function returns a dictionary with the expected key-value pairs.  If the function works correctly, the unit test will pass.  If the function does not work correctly, the unit test will fail, and the function needs to be modified to work correctly.  The unit test provides a way to test the function and ensure that it works correctly.  It is an important part of the development process.  Without unit tests, it is difficult to ensure that the function works correctly, and the function may not work correctly in all cases.  The unit test provides a way to test the function and ensure that it works correctly in all cases.  It is an important part of the development process.  It helps to ensure that the function works correctly and provides a way to test the function.  It is an important part of the development process.
