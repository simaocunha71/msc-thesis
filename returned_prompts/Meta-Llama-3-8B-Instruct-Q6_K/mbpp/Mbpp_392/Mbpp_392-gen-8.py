The function uses a memoization approach to store the results of subproblems and avoid recomputing them. The base case is when n is less than or equal to 1, in which case the function returns n. Otherwise, the function calculates the maximum sum by considering the maximum sum of the divisions of n by 2, 3, 4, and 5, and stores the result in the memo dictionary. The function returns the maximum sum. The unit test `assert get_max_sum(60) == 106` is used to verify the correctness of the function.
