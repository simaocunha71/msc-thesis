The problem is asking to find the maximum sum possible by using the given equation f(n) = max( (f(n/2) + f(n/3) + f(n/4) + f(n/5)), n). 

This problem is a typical example of memoization, where we store the results of expensive function calls and re-use them when the same inputs occur again. 

In this solution, we create a dictionary `memo` to store the results of the function calls. We initialize it with the base case `f(1) = 1`. 

Then, for each number `i` from 2 to `n`, we check if it's already in the `memo` dictionary. If it is, we skip it. If not, we calculate the maximum sum by recursively calling the function for the divisors of `i` (2, 3, 4, 5) and adding `i` to the result. We store the maximum sum in the `memo` dictionary. 

Finally, we return the maximum sum for the given number `n`. The unit test `assert get_max_sum(60) == 106` ensures the correctness of the solution. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the recursive calls and a space complexity of O(n) for the `memo` dictionary.
