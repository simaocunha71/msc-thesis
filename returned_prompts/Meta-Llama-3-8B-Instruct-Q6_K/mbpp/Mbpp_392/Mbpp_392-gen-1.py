The unit test `assert get_max_sum(60) == 106` ensures that the function works correctly. It checks if the maximum sum for the number 60 is indeed 106. The function uses a memoization technique to store the results of subproblems and reuse them to avoid redundant calculations. This technique helps to reduce the time complexity of the function. The function also handles the case where `n` is a multiple of 60 by considering the base case where all divisors are 1. In this case, the maximum sum is simply `n`. Otherwise, the function recursively calls itself with the divisors of `n` and returns the maximum sum. The function uses a dictionary `memo` to store the results of subproblems and returns the maximum sum for the given number `n`.
