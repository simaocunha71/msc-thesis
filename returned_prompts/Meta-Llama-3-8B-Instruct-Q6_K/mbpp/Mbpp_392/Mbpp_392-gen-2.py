The problem is asking to find the maximum sum possible by using the given equation f(n) = max( (f(n/2) + f(n/3) + f(n/4) + f(n/5)), n). This problem can be solved using dynamic programming.

We define a function `get_max_sum` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the maximum sum possible. We also define a memoization dictionary `memo` to store the results of subproblems.

The function `f` is defined recursively. It takes an integer `n` as input and returns the maximum sum possible. If `n` is less than 1, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum sum by considering the maximum sum of the subproblems and the value of `n` itself. The maximum sum is stored in the `memo` dictionary.

The function `get_max_sum` calls the function `f` with the input `n` and returns the result.

The unit test `assert get_max_sum(60) == 106` helps to verify the correctness of the solution.

Note that the problem is asking to find the maximum sum possible, but the equation is not clear about the base case. However, based on the unit test, we can assume that the base case is when `n` is 1, and the maximum sum is 1. This assumption is consistent with the unit test.
