```
def sum_series(n):
    return sum(n - 2 * i for i in range(n // 2 + 1))
```


The problem is asking to write a function that calculates the sum of the series `n + (n-2) + (n-4) + ... + (n-x)`, where `x` is the smallest integer such that `n-x` is less than or equal to 0.

The unit test `assert sum_series(6) == 12` helps to understand the problem better. For example, when `n` is 6, the series is `6 + (6-2) + (6-4) = 12`.

Here is a Python function that calculates the sum:

```
def sum_series(n):
    return sum(n - 2 * i for i in range(n // 2 + 1))
```

This function uses a generator expression to calculate the sum. It iterates over the range `n // 2 + 1` and for each `i`, it calculates `n - 2 * i`. The `sum` function then adds up all these values. The result is the sum of the series. 

For example, when `n` is 6, the function calculates the sum as `6 + 4 + 2 = 12`. 

The unit test `assert sum_series(6) == 12` passes for this function.
