The problem is asking to write a function that calculates the sum of a series where each term is `n - 2*i` for `i` from 0 to `n // 2`. 

For example, if `n` is 6, the series would be `6 + (6-2) + (6-4) = 12`.

The unit test `assert sum_series(6) == 12` helps to clarify the problem.

The solution is a simple loop that calculates the sum of the series. The loop runs from 0 to `n // 2` (inclusive), and in each iteration, it adds `n - 2 * i` to the total sum. The function returns the total sum. 

This solution passes the given unit test. 

Note: This problem is equivalent to finding the sum of the first `n // 2` terms of the arithmetic series `n - 2k` where `k` is an integer. The sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula `n * (a1 + an) / 2` where `a1` is the first term and `an` is the last term. In this case, `a1 = n` and `an = n - 2 * (n // 2) = n - n + 2 = 2`. So the sum is `(n * (n + 2)) / 2`. However, the problem statement does not explicitly mention the arithmetic series, so this solution is more straightforward and easier to understand. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1). 

The solution is efficient and easy to understand. It is also easy to implement and debug.
