def sum_series(n):
    return sum(n - 2 * i for i in range(n // 2 + 1))
```  # or: return sum(range(1, n // 2 + 1)) * 2 - n
```
```


Explanation:
The task is to create a function that calculates the sum of the series: n + (n-2) + (n-4)... (until n-x <= 0). 

The unit test `assert sum_series(6) == 12` suggests that the function should return 12 for input 6. This is because the sum of the series for n = 6 is n + (n-2) + (n-4) = 6 + 4 + 2 = 12.

The solution is a simple Python function that uses a generator expression to calculate the sum of the series. The `range` function generates numbers from 0 to n//2 (inclusive), and the expression `n - 2 * i` calculates the term for each number i. The `sum` function then adds up these terms.

The alternative solution uses the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `sum = n * (n + 1) / 2`. In this case, the sum is `n * (n + 1) / 2 - n`, because the first term is n and the last term is n - 2 * (n // 2), which is 0. This formula is more efficient than the generator expression, especially for large values of n. However, the generator expression is more readable and easier to understand.
