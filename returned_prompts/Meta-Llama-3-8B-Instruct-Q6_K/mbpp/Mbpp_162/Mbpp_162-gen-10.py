```
def sum_series(n):
    total = 0
    for i in range(n // 2 + 1):
        total += n - 2 * i
    return total
```
This function calculates the sum of the series `n + (n-2) + (n-4)...` up to `n // 2`. It does this by iterating over the range `n // 2 + 1` and adding each term to the total. The function then returns the total sum.

The unit test `assert sum_series(6) == 12` confirms that the function works correctly for the input `n = 6`. For `n = 6`, the series is `6 + (6-2) + (6-4) = 12`. The function correctly calculates this sum. 

This function assumes that `n` is a positive integer. If `n` is not a positive integer, the function may not work correctly. 

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the input to the function. This is because the function iterates over a range of size `n // 2 + 1`. The space complexity is O(1), which means the function uses a constant amount of space. This is because the function only uses a fixed amount of space to store the total and the current number in the series. 

The function has a small constant factor in its time complexity because it uses the `//` operator to perform integer division. This operator is more efficient than the `/` operator, which returns a floating-point number. However, this difference is usually negligible for small inputs. 

In general, the time complexity of a function depends on the input size and the operations performed by the function. The space complexity of a function depends on the amount of memory used by the function. In this case, the time complexity is O(n) and the space complexity is O(1).
