# Test case
assert sum_series(6) == 12
# Explanation: sum_series(6) = (6-0) + (6-2) + (6-4) = 12
# So, sum_series(6) = 12, which is correct. 
# This function works for any positive integer n. 
# It calculates the sum of series where each term is n minus twice the current index. 
# It does this by iterating over all indices from 0 to n//2, and for each index i, it adds n - 2*i to the sum. 
# The sum is then returned. 
# The function works for any positive integer n because it uses n//2 as the upper limit of the for loop. 
# This is because the series has n//2 + 1 terms, and the last term is n - 2*(n//2), which is 0. 
# So, the function will correctly calculate the sum of the series for any positive integer n.  # noqa: E501
# Time complexity: O(n), where n is the input. 
# Space complexity: O(1), because the function only uses a constant amount of space. 
# This function is efficient because it uses a simple for loop and does not use any complex data structures or algorithms. 
# It is also easy to understand and modify, which makes it a good choice for many applications. 
# However, it is not suitable for very large inputs because its time complexity is O(n), which means its running time will grow linearly with the size of the input. 
# For very large inputs, a more efficient algorithm or data structure may be needed.  # noqa: E501
# The function is tested with the input 6, and the result is 12, which is the correct sum of the series for n = 6. 
# The test case is added to ensure that the function works correctly for this input. 
# If the function is modified to handle different types of inputs or to improve its performance, the test case should be updated accordingly.  # noqa: E501
# The function is also documented with a description of what it does, the conditions under which it works, and its time and space complexity. 
# This makes it
