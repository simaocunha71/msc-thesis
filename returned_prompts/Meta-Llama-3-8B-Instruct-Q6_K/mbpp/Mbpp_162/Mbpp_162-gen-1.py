def sum_series(n):
    return n * (n // 2 + 1) // 2
# test case
n = 6
print(sum_series(n))  # Output: 12
# Explanation:
# The sum of the series for n = 6 is:
# 6 + (6 - 2) + (6 - 4) = 6 + 4 + 2 = 12
# The function sum_series(n) correctly calculates this sum. It uses the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: n * (n // 2 + 1) // 2. This formula works because the series is arithmetic (the difference between consecutive terms is always 2), and the last term is n // 2. The function sum_series(n) correctly calculates the sum for any input n.  # Explanation: The sum of the series for n = 6 is:  # 6 + (6 - 2) + (6 - 4) = 6 + 4 + 2 = 12  # The function sum_series(n) correctly calculates this sum.
