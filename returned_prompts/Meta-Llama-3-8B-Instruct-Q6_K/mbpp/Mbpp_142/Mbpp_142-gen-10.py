```
def count_samepair(list1, list2, list3):
    count = 0
    for i in range(min(len(list1), len(list2), len(list3))):
        if list1[i] == list2[i] == list3[i]:
            count += 1
    return count
```





Solution:
```
def count_samepair(list1, list2, list3):
    count = 0
    for i in range(min(len(list1), len(list2), len(list3))):
        if list1[i] == list2[i] == list3[i]:
            count += 1
    return count
```





Explanation:
The problem asks to write a function that counts the number of items that are identical in the same position of three given lists. 

The function `count_samepair` takes three lists as input and initializes a counter variable `count` to 0. Then, it iterates over the minimum length of the three lists using the `min` function. For each iteration, it checks if the current elements in the three lists are equal. If they are, it increments the `count` by 1. Finally, it returns the `count`.

The unit test `assert count_samepair([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8],[2,2,3,1,2,6,7,9],[2,1,3,1,2,6,7,9])==3` ensures that the function works correctly. It checks if the function returns 3 when the input lists are `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]`, `[2,2,3,1,2,6,7,9]`, and `[2,1,3,1,2,6,7,9]`. If the function returns the correct count, the test passes; otherwise, it fails.
