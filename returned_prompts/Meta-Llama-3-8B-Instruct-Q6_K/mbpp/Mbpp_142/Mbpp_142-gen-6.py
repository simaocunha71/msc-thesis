"""
The problem is asking you to write a function that counts the number of items that are identical in the same position of three given lists. 

Here is the Python solution for the problem:

```Python
def count_samepair(list1, list2, list3):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(list1)):
        if list1[i] == list2[i] == list3[i]:
            count += 1
    return count
```

This function works by iterating over each position in the lists. If the items at that position in all three lists are identical, it increments the count. Finally, it returns the count. 

The unit test `assert count_samepair([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8],[2,2,3,1,2,6,7,9],[2,1,3,1,2,6,7,9])==3` ensures that the function is working correctly. It checks that the function returns 3 for the given inputs. 

Please note that the input lists should have the same length. If they don't, the function will return incorrect results. You might want to add error checking to handle this case. """
