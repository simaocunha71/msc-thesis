```
def check_distinct(t):
    return len(t) == len(set(t))
```


This function works by comparing the length of the tuple `t` with the length of a set created from `t`. In Python, a set is an unordered collection of unique elements. If the lengths are equal, it means that all elements in the tuple were unique and there were no duplicates. If the lengths are not equal, it means that there were duplicate elements in the tuple. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the tuple contains duplicates or not. 

The unit test `assert check_distinct((1, 4, 5, 6, 1, 4)) == False` is used to test this function. This test checks if the function correctly identifies a tuple with duplicates. The expected output is `False`, which is what the function should return for this input. 

Note: The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the tuple, because it needs to iterate over all elements in the tuple to create the set. The space complexity is also O(n), because in the worst case, the set will contain all elements from the tuple. 

Also, the function does not preserve the order of elements in the tuple. If you need to preserve the order, you can use a different approach, for example, by converting the tuple to a list and using the `in` operator to check for duplicates. However, this approach would have a higher time complexity. 

Here is the alternative implementation:
```
def check_distinct(t):
    seen = set()
    for elem in t:
        if elem in seen:
            return False
        seen.add(elem)
    return True
```
This function has the same time complexity as the previous one, but it has a higher space complexity because it needs to store all elements in the `seen` set. 

In general, the choice of implementation depends on the specific requirements of your problem and the constraints you are working under. If you need to preserve the order of elements, the alternative implementation might be a better choice. If you don't care about the order and you need to optimize for space complexity, the original implementation might be a better choice.
