def check_distinct(t):
    return len(set(t)) == len(t)
```


The function `check_distinct` takes a tuple `t` as input and returns `True` if the tuple contains no duplicates, and `False` otherwise.

The function converts the tuple into a set, which automatically removes any duplicate elements. It then compares the length of the set with the length of the original tuple. If the lengths are equal, it means that the tuple did not contain any duplicates, so the function returns `True`. If the lengths are not equal, it means that the tuple contained at least one duplicate, so the function returns `False`. 

The unit test `assert check_distinct((1, 4, 5, 6, 1, 4)) == False` ensures that the function correctly identifies a tuple with duplicates.  This test case is designed to check that the function correctly identifies a tuple with duplicates. 

For example, `check_distinct((1, 4, 5, 6, 1, 4))` returns `False` because the tuple `(1, 4, 5, 6, 1, 4)` contains duplicates.  On the other hand, `check_distinct((1, 2, 3, 4, 5))` returns `True` because the tuple `(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)` does not contain any duplicates. 

In summary, this function correctly identifies tuples with and without duplicates, and it is a simple and efficient way to check for duplicate elements in a tuple.  It is also easy to understand and use, which makes it a good solution for this problem.  It is also a good example of how to use sets in Python to solve a problem, and how to write a function that checks for a certain condition in a tuple.  It is a good reference for any programmer who wants to learn how to write a function that checks for duplicate elements in a tuple.  It is also a good example of how to write a function that is easy to understand and use, and how to write a function that is efficient and correct.
