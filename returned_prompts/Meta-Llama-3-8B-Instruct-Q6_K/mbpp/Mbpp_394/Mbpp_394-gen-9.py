```
def check_distinct(t):
    return len(t) == len(set(t))
```

This function works by comparing the length of the tuple to the length of the set created from the tuple. In Python, a set is an unordered collection of unique elements. If the tuple contains any duplicates, the set will have a smaller length than the tuple, and the function will return False. If the tuple contains no duplicates, the set will have the same length as the tuple, and the function will return True.

The unit test provided, `assert check_distinct((1, 4, 5, 6, 1, 4)) == False`, suggests that the function should return False when the tuple contains duplicates. This is because the tuple `(1, 4, 5, 6, 1, 4)` does contain duplicates (the numbers 1 and 4 appear twice). Therefore, the function should return False for this input.
