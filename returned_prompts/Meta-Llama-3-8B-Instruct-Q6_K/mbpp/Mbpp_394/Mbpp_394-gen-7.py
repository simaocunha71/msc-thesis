```
def check_distinct(t):
    return len(t) == len(set(t))
```


The problem is asking you to write a function that checks if a given tuple contains no duplicates. The function should return `True` if the tuple has no duplicates and `False` otherwise.

The unit test provided, `assert check_distinct((1, 4, 5, 6, 1, 4)) == False`, suggests that the function should return `False` for a tuple with duplicates.

Here's a simple solution using Python's built-in `set` data structure, which automatically removes duplicates. We compare the length of the tuple with the length of the set. If they are equal, it means the tuple had no duplicates, so we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`. 

Here's the code:
```
def check_distinct(t):
    return len(t) == len(set(t))
```
This function works by converting the tuple `t` to a set, which removes any duplicates. It then compares the length of the original tuple with the length of the set. If they are equal, it means the tuple had no duplicates, so the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. 

For example, if we call `check_distinct((1, 4, 5, 6, 1, 4))`, the function will return `False` because the tuple has duplicates. If we call `check_distinct((1, 2, 3, 4, 5))`, the function will return `True` because the tuple has no duplicates.
