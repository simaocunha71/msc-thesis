def sum_digits(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))
```


The unit test `assert sum_digits(345)==12` indicates that the function should return the sum of the digits of the input number. This can be achieved by converting the number to a string, iterating over each character (digit) in the string, converting the character back to an integer, and then summing up all these integers. This can be done using a generator expression with the built-in `sum` function. The final result is returned by the function. 





Note: 
- The unit test `assert sum_digits(345)==12` ensures that the function works correctly for the input `345`. 
- The function takes an integer `n` as input, converts it to a string, and then iterates over each character (digit) in the string. 
- For each digit, it converts the character back to an integer using the `int` function and adds it to the total sum using the `sum` function. 
- The final result is returned by the function. 
- The function is designed to work with non-negative integers, as specified in the problem statement. 
- If the input is a negative integer, the function will not work correctly, as it will convert the negative sign to a character and try to add it to the sum. To handle negative integers, you could add a check at the beginning of the function to convert the input to a non-negative integer. 
- The function assumes that the input is a non-negative integer, and it does not perform any error checking. If the input is not a non-negative integer, the function may not work correctly. To handle invalid inputs, you could add error checking at the beginning of the function to ensure that the input is a non-negative integer. 
- The function is designed to be efficient and scalable, as it uses a generator expression with the built-in `sum` function, which is a efficient and scalable way to calculate the sum of a sequence of numbers. 
- The function is easy to understand and maintain, as it is simple and straightforward, and it uses standard Python syntax and built-in functions. 
- The function is tested using a unit test, which ensures that it works correctly for the input `345`. 
- The function is designed to be reusable, as it can be used with different inputs and it does not have any dependencies on external libraries or modules. 
- The function is designed to be extensible, as
