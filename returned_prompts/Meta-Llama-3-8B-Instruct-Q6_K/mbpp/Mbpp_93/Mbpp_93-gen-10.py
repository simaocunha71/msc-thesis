def power(a, b):
    return a ** b
```  # 3^4 = 3*3*3*3 = 81
```
This function takes two arguments, 'a' and 'b', and returns the value of 'a' to the power 'b'. The '**' operator in Python is used to calculate the power. For example, 3 ** 4 equals 81, which is 3 to the power of 4. This function is tested with the unit test `assert power(3,4) == 81`, which checks if the function returns 81 when called with arguments 3 and 4.  # 3^4 = 3*3*3*3 = 81
