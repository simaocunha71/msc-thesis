```
def power(a, b):
    return a ** b
```
The problem is asking to create a function that calculates the value of 'a' to the power 'b'. This is a simple mathematical operation that can be achieved using the '**' operator in Python.

The unit test provided is `assert power(3,4) == 81`, which means the function should return 81 when given the inputs 3 and 4. This can be achieved by raising 3 to the power of 4, which is indeed 81. 

Therefore, the solution is a simple function that takes two arguments 'a' and 'b', and returns the result of 'a' to the power 'b'. The function can be written as follows:
```
def power(a, b):
    return a ** b
```
