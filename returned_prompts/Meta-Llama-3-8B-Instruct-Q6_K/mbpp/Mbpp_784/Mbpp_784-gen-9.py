```
def mul_even_odd(lst):
    even = [i for i in lst if i % 2 == 0]
    odd = [i for i in lst if i % 2 != 0]
    if even and odd:
        return even[0] * odd[0]
    return None
```


The function `mul_even_odd` takes a list `lst` as input and returns the product of the first even and odd number in the list. It first filters the list to get the even and odd numbers in separate lists. Then, it checks if both lists are not empty. If they are not empty, it returns the product of the first even and odd number. If either of the lists is empty, it returns `None`. The unit test `assert mul_even_odd([1,3,5,7,4,1,6,8])==4` ensures that the function works correctly. 

The unit test `assert mul_even_odd([1,3,5,7,4,1,6,8]) == 4` is a valid test case because the first even number in the list is 4 and the first odd number is 1, and their product is 4. The test case `assert mul_even_odd([2,4,6,8]) == 2` is also a valid test case because the first even number is 2 and the first odd number does not exist in the list, so the function should return `None`. The test case `assert mul_even_odd([]) == None` is also a valid test case because the list is empty, so the function should return `None`. 

The function can be improved by adding error handling for cases where the list is empty or the first even and odd number do not exist in the list. For example, we can add a check at the beginning of the function to return `None` if the list is empty. We can also add a check after filtering the lists to return `None` if either of the lists is empty. 

Here is the improved function:
```
def mul_even_odd(lst):
    if not lst:
        return None
    even = [i for i in lst if i % 2 == 0]
    odd = [i for i in lst if i % 2 != 0]
    if even and odd:
        return even[0] * odd[0]
    return None
```


This function will return `None` if the list is
