def mul_even_odd(lst):
    for num in lst:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            even_num = num
            break
    for num in lst:
        if num % 2 != 0:

    return even_num * odd_num
```    
The function iterates through the list and finds the first even and odd number. Then it returns the product of these two numbers. The unit test `assert mul_even_odd([1,3,5,7,4,1,6,8])==4` ensures that the function works correctly. It checks that the product of the first even number (4) and the first odd number (1) is 4. 

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. This is because it has to iterate through the list at least once. The space complexity is O(1), which means it uses constant space. This is because it only uses a few variables to store the even and odd numbers.
