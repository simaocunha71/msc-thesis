"""
This function uses Python's built-in bin() function to convert the decimal number to a binary string. The [2:] is used to remove the '0b' prefix that bin() adds to the output. The unit test assert decimal_to_binary(8) == '1000' ensures that the function works correctly.
"""  # Corrected code
# The unit test assert decimal_to_binary(8) == '1000' ensures that the function works correctly.  # Corrected code

Output:
```
>>> decimal_to_binary(8)
'1000'
```
The function correctly converts the decimal number 8 to its binary equivalent, which is '1000'.  # Output

Explanation:
The bin() function in Python converts an integer number to a binary string. It prefixes the result with '0b' to indicate that it's a binary number. We use slicing to remove the '0b' prefix and get the binary string. For example, bin(8) returns '0b1000', and bin(8)[2:] returns '1000'.  # Explanation

Time Complexity: O(1) - The function uses a constant amount of time to convert the decimal number to its binary equivalent.  # Time Complexity

Space Complexity: O(1) - The function uses a constant amount of space to store the binary string.  # Space Complexity

This solution is efficient and easy to understand, and it passes the given unit test.  # Conclusion  # Corrected code  # Output  # Explanation  # Time Complexity  # Space Complexity
