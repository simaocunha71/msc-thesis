```
In this code, we are using NLTK's pos_tag function to tag each word in the sentence with its part of speech. The part of speech tag for adverbs is 'RB'. So, we iterate over the tagged words and return the position of the first adverb and its word. If no adverb is found, the function returns None.

The unit test `assert find_adverb_position("clearly!! we can see the sky")==(0, 7, 'clearly')` ensures that the function returns the correct position and word for the given sentence. The expected output is (0, 7, 'clearly'), which means the first adverb 'clearly' is at position 0 and its word starts at position 7. 

Please note that this code assumes that the sentence is in English and the part of speech tagging is accurate. For other languages or sentences with incorrect tagging, the code may not work correctly. 

Also, note that the position returned is 0-based, meaning the first character of the sentence is at position 0. The position of the word is the sum of the positions of all the characters in the word. The position of the last character of the word is the position of the word minus the length of the word. 

This code also assumes that the adverb is a single word. If the adverb is a phrase, the code will not return the correct position. 

The function returns a tuple of three values: the position of the first adverb, the position of the last character of the first adverb, and the word itself. If no adverb is found, the function returns None. 

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of words in the sentence. The space complexity is O(n) as well, as we are storing all the words and their tags in memory. 

Please note that the NLTK library needs to be installed and downloaded for this code to work. The download process may take some time. 

Also, please note that this code is case-sensitive.
