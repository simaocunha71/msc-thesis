The function `find_adverb_position` takes a sentence as input and returns a tuple of the position of the first adverb and the length of the text before the adverb. If no adverb is found, it returns None. The adverbs used in this function are hardcoded, but this can be modified to include more adverbs or to dynamically generate the list of adverbs. The function splits the sentence into words and checks each word to see if it is in the list of adverbs. If an adverb is found, the function returns its position, the length of the text before the adverb, and the adverb itself. Otherwise, it returns None. The unit test `assert find_adverb_position("clearly!! we can see the sky")==(0, 7, 'clearly')` checks that the function correctly finds the adverb "clearly" in the sentence and returns its position, the length of the text before the adverb, and the adverb itself.  # Return None if no adverb is found
