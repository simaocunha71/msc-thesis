```    
The function splits the sentence into words, then iterates over the words. For each word, it checks if the word matches any of the adverbs in the regular expression. If a match is found, it returns a tuple containing the position of the word, the length of the word, and the word itself. If no match is found, it returns None. The regular expression used in this function is case-insensitive, so it will match adverbs regardless of their case. The unit test provided in the problem ensures that the function works correctly for the given sentence.    
```python
assert find_adverb_position("clearly!! we can see the sky")==(0, 7, 'clearly')
```    
This unit test checks that the function returns the correct result for the sentence "clearly!! we can see the sky". The expected result is a tuple containing the position 0, the length 7, and the word 'clearly'. The function should return this result because 'clearly' is the first adverb in the sentence.    
```python
assert find_adverb_position("we can see the sky clearly!!")==None
```    
This unit test checks that the function returns None when there is no adverb in the sentence. The expected result is None, which is the correct result because there is no adverb in the sentence "we can see the sky clearly!!".    
```python
assert find_adverb_position("we can see the sky often!!")==(4, 7, 'often')
```    
This unit test checks that the function returns the correct result when the adverb is not at the beginning of the sentence. The expected result is a tuple containing the position 4, the length 5, and the word 'often'. The function should return this result because 'often' is the adverb in the sentence "we can see the sky often!!".    
```python
assert find_adverb_position("we often can see the sky!!")==(1, 5, 'often')
```    
This unit test checks that the function
