```
def expensive_items(data, n):
    data.sort(key=lambda x: x['price'], reverse=True)
    return data[:n]
```
The problem is asking you to write a function that finds the n most expensive items in a given dataset. The dataset is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an item with a 'name' key and a 'price' key.

The unit test provided suggests that the function should return a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains the name and price of an item.

Here is the solution:
```
def expensive_items(data, n):
    data.sort(key=lambda x: x['price'], reverse=True)
    return data[:n]
```
This function sorts the dataset in descending order based on the price of each item, and then returns the first n items. The `lambda` function is used to specify the key function for sorting, which is the 'price' key in this case.

For example, if you call the function with the following dataset and n=1, it will return the most expensive item:
```
data = [{'name': 'Item-1', 'price': 101.1},{'name': 'Item-2', 'price': 555.22}]
print(expensive_items(data, 1))  # Output: [{'name': 'Item-2', 'price': 555.22}]
``` 1
```
This function works by first sorting the dataset in descending order based on the price of each item. This is done using the `sort` method with a `lambda` function as the key. The `lambda` function specifies that the key for sorting is the 'price' key in each dictionary.

Then, the function returns the first n items from the sorted dataset. This is done using slicing, where `data[:n]` returns a new list containing the first n elements of the original list.

The time complexity of this function is O(n log n), where n is the number of items in the dataset. This is because the `sort` method has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case. The space complexity is O(n), as the function returns a new list containing the first n items. 1
