```
def expensive_items(dataset, n):
    return sorted(dataset, key=lambda x: x['price'], reverse=True)[:n]
```



The given problem is to write a function that finds the n most expensive items in a given dataset. The dataset is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an item with its name and price.

The function should return a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents the n most expensive items.

Here is the solution in Python:

```
def expensive_items(dataset, n):
    return sorted(dataset, key=lambda x: x['price'], reverse=True)[:n]
```

This function works by first sorting the dataset in descending order based on the price of each item. The `sorted` function returns a new list that contains all items from the original list in ascending order. The `key` argument is a function that takes a list item and returns a value that will be used for sorting purposes. In this case, the key function is `lambda x: x['price']`, which returns the price of each item.

The `reverse=True` argument is used to sort the list in descending order, so the most expensive items are at the beginning of the list.

Finally, the function returns the first `n` items from the sorted list, which are the n most expensive items.

The unit test `assert expensive_items([{'name': 'Item-1', 'price': 101.1},{'name': 'Item-2', 'price': 555.22}],1)==[{'name': 'Item-2', 'price': 555.22}]` ensures that the function works correctly. It checks that when the dataset is `[{'name': 'Item-1', 'price': 101.1},{'name': 'Item-2', 'price': 555.22}]` and `n` is `1`, the function returns `[{'name': 'Item-2', 'price': 555.22}]`, which is the most expensive item in the dataset.
