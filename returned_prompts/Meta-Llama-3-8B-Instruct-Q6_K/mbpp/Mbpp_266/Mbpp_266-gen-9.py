def lateralsurface_cube(side_length):
    return 4 * side_length ** 2
```


The lateral surface area of a cube is given by the formula 4 * side_length ** 2. This is because a cube has 4 sides and each side is a square with the same side length. The area of a square is given by the side length ** 2. So the lateral surface area is 4 * side_length ** 2. The unit test assert lateralsurface_cube(5)==100 also confirms this. 

The function lateralsurface_cube takes the side length of the cube as input and returns the lateral surface area. It uses the formula 4 * side_length ** 2 to calculate the lateral surface area. 

The unit test assert lateralsurface_cube(5)==100 checks if the function is working correctly. The expected output of the function for a side length of 5 is 100, which is the lateral surface area of a cube with a side length of 5. If the function is working correctly, the unit test will pass. 

The function can be used to find the lateral surface area of any cube given its side length. It is a simple and efficient function that uses the correct formula to calculate the lateral surface area of a cube.
