```
def lateralsurface_cube(side_length):
    return 4 * side_length ** 2
```



The lateral surface area of a cube is the sum of the areas of its four sides. Since the sides are squares, the area of each side is side_length^2. Therefore, the lateral surface area is 4 * side_length^2. This is what the function calculates. The unit test `assert lateralsurface_cube(5)==100` confirms that this is correct, as the lateral surface area of a cube with side length 5 is indeed 100.
