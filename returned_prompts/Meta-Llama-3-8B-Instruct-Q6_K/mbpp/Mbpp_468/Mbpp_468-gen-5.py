    min_product[0] = arr[0]
    
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        max_product[i] = max(arr[i], max_product[i-1] * arr[i], min_product[i-1] * arr[i])
        min_product[i] = min(arr[i], max_product[i-1] * arr[i], min_product[i-1] * arr[i])

The idea is to maintain two arrays `max_product` and `min_product`, where `max_product[i]` is the maximum product that can be formed by multiplying numbers up to `arr[i]`, and `min_product[i]` is the minimum product that can be formed by multiplying numbers up to `arr[i]`.

We initialize `max_product[0]` and `min_product[0]` to `arr[0]`. Then, for each `i` from 1 to `len(arr) - 1`, we update `max_product[i]` and `min_product[i]` as follows:

`max_product[i]` is the maximum of `arr[i]`, `max_product[i-1] * arr[i]`, and `min_product[i-1] * arr[i]`. This is because the maximum product can be formed by either multiplying the current number with the maximum product of the previous numbers or the minimum product of the previous numbers.

`min_product[i]` is the minimum of `arr[i]`, `max_product[i-1] * arr[i]`, and `min_product[i-1] * arr[i]`. This is because the minimum product can be formed by either multiplying the current number with the maximum product of the previous numbers or the minimum product of the previous numbers.

Finally, we return the maximum value in `max_product` as the maximum product that can be formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of the array.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the array, and the space complexity is O(n). The solution passes the given unit test.
