The problem is asking for a function that finds all numbers within a given range where every digit in the number is divisible by that digit. For example, the number 12 is divisible by its digits 1 and 2, so it should be included in the result. 

The unit test `assert divisible_by_digits(1,22)==[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 22]` helps to clarify the problem. 

Here's a Python function that solves the problem:

```
def divisible_by_digits(startnum, endnum):
    result = []
    for num in range(startnum, endnum + 1):
        is_divisible = True
        for digit in str(num):
            if num % int(digit) != 0:
                is_divisible = False
                break
        if is_divisible:
            result.append(num)
    return result
```

This function iterates over all numbers in the given range. For each number, it checks if each digit is divisible by the number. If a digit is not divisible, it breaks out of the inner loop and moves on to the next number. If all digits are divisible, it adds the number to the result list. Finally, it returns the list of numbers that are divisible by all their digits. 





Here is the explanation of the code:

- The function `divisible_by_digits` takes two arguments, `startnum` and `endnum`, which represent the range of numbers to check.
- The function initializes an empty list `result` to store the numbers that are divisible by all their digits.
- The function then iterates over all numbers in the range using a for loop.
- For each number, it converts the number to a string using the `str` function, and then iterates over each character (digit) in the string using another for loop.
- For each digit, it checks if the number is divisible by the digit using the modulo operator (`%`). If the
