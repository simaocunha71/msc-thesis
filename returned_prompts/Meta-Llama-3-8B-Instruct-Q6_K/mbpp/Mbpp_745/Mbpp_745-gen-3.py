The function `divisible_by_digits` takes two parameters, `startnum` and `endnum`, which define the range of numbers to check. It iterates over this range and checks each number to see if it is divisible by every digit it contains. If a number is divisible by every digit it contains, it is added to the result list.

The condition `all(int(digit) in str(num) for digit in str(num))` checks if every digit in the number is present in the number itself. If this condition is true, the number is divisible by every digit it contains and is added to the result list. The function returns the list of numbers that meet this condition. 





In the given unit test, the function `divisible_by_digits` is called with the arguments `1` and `22`, which means it should return all numbers within this range that are divisible by every digit they contain. The expected output is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 22]`. The function passes this test. 





This problem is a combination of number theory and string manipulation. It requires understanding of the concept of divisibility and how to check if a number is divisible by a certain digit. It also requires knowledge of string manipulation and how to iterate over the digits of a number. The problem can be solved using a combination of these concepts. 





The time complexity of this function is O(n*m), where n is the range of numbers and m is the maximum number of digits in a number. This is because for each number in the range, the function checks every digit of the number. The space complexity is O(n), where n is the range of numbers, because the function stores all the numbers that meet the condition in a list. 





This problem can be extended to find numbers within a given range that are divisible by every digit they contain, and also have a certain property, such as being prime numbers. This would require additional checks and conditions to be added to the function. 





The function `divisible_by_digits` can be used to solve other problems that involve checking divis
