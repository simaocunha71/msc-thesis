```
def last_Digit(n):
    return n % 10
```
This function uses the modulus operator `%` to find the remainder of the division of the number `n` by 10. The remainder is the last digit of the number. For example, `123 % 10` would be `3`. The function then returns this remainder. This function should pass the given unit test.  For example, `last_Digit(123)` would return `3`.  If you want to make it more general, you can use the `int` function to convert the result to an integer, like this: `int(n % 10)`.  But in this case, it's not necessary, because the result of the modulus operator is already an integer.  So, the function is already correct as it is.  The unit test `assert last_Digit(123) == 3` will pass.  This function will work correctly for any positive integer input.  If the input is a negative integer or a non-integer, the function will also work correctly, but it will return a negative number or a non-integer, respectively.  For example, `last_Digit(-123)` would return `-3`, and `last_Digit(123.45)` would return `5`.  This is because the modulus operator works with floating point numbers as well, and the result is the remainder of the division, which is always an integer.  So, the function is flexible and can handle different types of input.  However, the unit test `assert last_Digit(123) == 3` assumes that the input is a positive integer, so the function should work correctly only for positive integer inputs.  If you want the function to work correctly for all types of input, you would need to add additional checks and handling.  For example, you could convert the input to an integer using the `int` function, and then check if the result is negative.  If it is, you could return the last digit of the absolute value of the number.  But this would make the function more complex, and it would not be necessary in this case, because the unit test only checks the function with positive integer inputs.  So, the function is correct as it is, and it will pass the unit test.  However, if you want the function to be more general, you would need to add additional checks and handling.  For example, you could add a check at the beginning
