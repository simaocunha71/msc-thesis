```
def last_Digit(n):
    return n % 10
```


This function works by using the modulus operator `%` which returns the remainder of the division of `n` by `10`. The last digit of a number is the remainder when the number is divided by `10`. For example, the last digit of `123` is `3` because `123 % 10` is `3`. This function passes the given unit test `assert last_Digit(123) == 3`.
