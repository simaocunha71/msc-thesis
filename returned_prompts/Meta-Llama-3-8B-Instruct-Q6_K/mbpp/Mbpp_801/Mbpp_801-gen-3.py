def three_equal(a, b, c):
    return a == b == c
```  # This function returns True if all three numbers are equal, False otherwise.
```
You can use the unit test `assert test_three_equal(1,1,1) == 3` to guide the solution. It seems the function should return the count of equal numbers. We can use a simple if-else statement to count the number of equal numbers. Here is the solution:

```
def test_three_equal(a, b, c):
    if a == b == c:
        return 3
    elif a == b or a == c or b == c:
        return 2
    else:
        return 0
```  # This function returns the count of equal numbers from three given integers.
```
This function first checks if all three numbers are equal, then it checks if any two numbers are equal, and finally it returns 0 if no numbers are equal. The unit test `assert test_three_equal(1,1,1) == 3` passes with this solution.  # This is the end of the solution.
