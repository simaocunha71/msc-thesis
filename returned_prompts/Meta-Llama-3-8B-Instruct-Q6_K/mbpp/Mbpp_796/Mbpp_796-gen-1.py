```
def return_sum(d):
    return sum(d.values())
```


The function `return_sum` takes a dictionary `d` as input and returns the sum of all the values in the dictionary. The `values()` method is used to get a view object that displays a list of all values in the dictionary. Then, the built-in `sum` function is used to calculate the sum of all these values. 

For example, if the input dictionary is `{'a': 100, 'b':200, 'c':300}`, the function will return `600` which is the sum of all the values in the dictionary. This is confirmed by the unit test `assert return_sum({'a': 100, 'b':200, 'c':300}) == 600`. 

The function is designed to handle any dictionary with any type of values, not just integers. It will work correctly even if the dictionary contains floating point numbers or strings.  If the dictionary contains non-numeric values, the `sum` function will raise a `TypeError`. Depending on the requirements, the function could be modified to handle this situation by filtering out non-numeric values or by returning an error message.  However, this is not the case in the provided unit test.  The test assumes that all values in the dictionary are numeric and can be summed.  Therefore, the function is designed to work in this way.  If the dictionary contains non-numeric values, the function will raise a `TypeError`.  The unit test will fail if the function is modified to handle this situation.  Therefore, the function should be modified only if it is necessary to handle non-numeric values in the dictionary.  Otherwise, the function will work correctly for any dictionary with numeric values.  It is also worth noting that the function does not modify the input dictionary.  It returns the sum of the values in the dictionary.  The input dictionary remains unchanged.  This is consistent with the unit test, which checks the return value of the function, not the input dictionary.  Therefore, the function does not modify the input dictionary.  It simply returns a new value based on the input dictionary.  This is a good practice in programming, as it makes the code more predictable and easier to understand.  It also makes the code more reusable, as it can be used in different parts of the program without modifying the input dictionary.  Therefore, the function is designed to return a new value based on the input dictionary, without modifying the input dictionary
