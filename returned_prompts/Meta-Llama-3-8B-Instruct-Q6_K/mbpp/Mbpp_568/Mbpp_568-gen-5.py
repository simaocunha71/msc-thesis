The unit test `assert empty_list(5)==[{},{},{},{},{}]` suggests that the function should return a list of N empty dictionaries. 

The problem can be solved by creating a list of N empty dictionaries. This can be done using a list comprehension or the `*` operator. 

Here is the solution:

```
def empty_list(N):
    return [{} for _ in range(N)]
```

This function takes an integer N as input and returns a list of N empty dictionaries. The list comprehension `[{} for _ in range(N)]` creates a list of N empty dictionaries. The `_` variable is a throwaway variable that is not used in the loop. The `range(N)` function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to N-1. The list comprehension iterates over this sequence and creates a new empty dictionary for each number in the sequence. The resulting list of dictionaries is then returned by the function. 

This solution passes the unit test `assert empty_list(5)==[{},{},{},{},{}]`.  It is also efficient and easy to read. 

Alternatively, the same result can be achieved using the `*` operator:

```
def empty_list(N):
    return [{}]*N
```

This solution also creates a list of N empty dictionaries. The `*` operator is used to repeat the list `[{}]` N times. The resulting list of dictionaries is then returned by the function. 

This solution also passes the unit test `assert empty_list(5)==[{},{},{},{},{}]`.  However, it is less efficient than the list comprehension solution because it creates a new list of N empty dictionaries and then repeats it N times. 

Another alternative is to use a for loop:

```
def empty_list(N):
    return [dict() for _ in range(N)]
```

This solution uses a for loop to create a list of N empty dictionaries. The `dict()` function is used to create a new empty dictionary in each iteration of the loop. The resulting list of dictionaries is then returned by the function. 

This solution also passes the unit test `assert empty_list(5)==[{},{},{},{},{}]`.
