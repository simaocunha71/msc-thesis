def empty_list(N):
    return [{} for _ in range(N)]
```


The function `empty_list(N)` creates a list of `N` empty dictionaries. It does this by using a list comprehension, which is a concise way to create a list from an iterable expression. The iterable expression in this case is a simple `range(N)`, which generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `N-1`. For each number in this sequence, an empty dictionary `{}` is created and added to the list. The resulting list of `N` empty dictionaries is then returned by the function. 

The unit test `assert empty_list(5)==[{},{},{},{},{}]` confirms that the function works as expected, creating a list of 5 empty dictionaries. 

This function is efficient and easy to read, making it a good solution to this problem.  It has a time complexity of O(N), where N is the number of dictionaries to create, because it needs to iterate over a sequence of length N to create the dictionaries. The space complexity is also O(N), because it needs to store the N dictionaries in memory.  Therefore, this function is suitable for use with large values of N.  It is also easy to understand and modify, making it a good choice for most use cases.  However, if N is very large, it may be more efficient to use a different approach, such as using a generator expression instead of a list comprehension, or using a different data structure altogether.  In general, the best approach will depend on the specific requirements and constraints of the problem.  In this case, the list comprehension is a good choice because it is easy to read and understand, and it is efficient enough for most use cases.  It also provides a clear and concise way to create a list of N empty dictionaries, making it a good solution to the problem.  Therefore, the function `empty_list(N)` is a good solution to this problem.  It is easy to read and understand, efficient enough for most use cases, and provides a clear and concise way to create a list of N empty dictionaries.  It is a good choice for most use cases, and it is a good solution to the problem.  It is also easy to modify and extend, making it a good choice for most use cases.  It is also easy to test and debug, making it a good choice for most use cases.  It is a good solution to the problem, and it is a good choice
