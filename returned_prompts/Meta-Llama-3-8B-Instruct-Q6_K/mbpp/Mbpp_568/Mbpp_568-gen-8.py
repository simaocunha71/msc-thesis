```
def empty_list(N):
    return [{},]*N
```



The unit test provided, `assert empty_list(5)==[{},{},{},{},{}]`, suggests that the function should return a list of N empty dictionaries. 

One way to achieve this is by using the list multiplication feature in Python. This feature allows us to create a list of N copies of a given element. In this case, we want to create a list of N copies of an empty dictionary.

Here's the solution:

```
def empty_list(N):
    return [{},]*N
```

This function takes an integer N as input and returns a list of N empty dictionaries. The `*` operator is used to multiply the list of dictionaries by N, effectively creating a new list with N copies of the same element (an empty dictionary). 

For example, if you call `empty_list(5)`, the function will return `[{},{},{},{},{}]`, which is a list of 5 empty dictionaries. 

This solution is efficient and easy to understand, making it a good choice for this problem. 





Note: This solution assumes that the input N is a positive integer. If N can be negative or zero, additional checks should be added to handle these cases. For example, if N is zero, the function should return an empty list. If N is negative, the function should raise an error or return an error message.
