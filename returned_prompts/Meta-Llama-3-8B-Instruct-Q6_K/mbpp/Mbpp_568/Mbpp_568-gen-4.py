def empty_list(N):
    return [{}}*N

# Test case
assert empty_list(5) == [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}]

Explanation:
The problem is asking to create a function that returns a list of N empty dictionaries. 

The unit test `assert empty_list(5) == [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}]` suggests that the function should return a list of N dictionaries, each dictionary being empty.

To solve this problem, we can use list multiplication. We create an empty dictionary and multiply it by N to create a list of N empty dictionaries. The `*` operator is used to repeat the list. 

The function `empty_list(N)` takes an integer N as input and returns a list of N empty dictionaries. For example, `empty_list(5)` returns `[{}, {}, {}, {}, {}]`. 

This solution is efficient and easy to understand. It also passes the given unit test.
