```
def toggle_string(s):
    return s.swapcase()
```



The problem is asking to create a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string where all the characters are toggled (i.e., lowercase becomes uppercase and vice versa).

The unit test `assert toggle_string("Python")==("pYTHON")` suggests that the function should swap the case of each character in the input string.

Here is the solution in Python:
```
def toggle_string(s):
    return s.swapcase()
```
This function uses the built-in `swapcase` method of Python strings, which swaps the case of each character in the string. For example, "Python" becomes "pYTHON" and "HELLO" becomes "hELLO". The function returns the modified string.
