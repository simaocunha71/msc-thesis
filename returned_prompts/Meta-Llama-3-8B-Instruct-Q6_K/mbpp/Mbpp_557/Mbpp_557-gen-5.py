```
def toggle_string(s):
    return s.swapcase()
``` 

Explanation:
The problem is asking to write a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string with the case of all characters toggled. For example, if the input string is "Python", the output should be "pYTHON".

The unit test provided is `assert toggle_string("Python")==("pYTHON")`, which suggests that the function should toggle the case of all characters in the input string.

The `swapcase()` method in Python is a built-in method that can be used to toggle the case of all characters in a string. It converts uppercase characters to lowercase and vice versa. Therefore, we can use this method to solve the problem.

Here's the solution:
```
def toggle_string(s):
    return s.swapcase()
```
This function takes a string `s` as input, calls the `swapcase()` method on it, and returns the resulting string. The `swapcase()` method toggles the case of all characters in the string, so the output will be a new string with the case of all characters toggled.
