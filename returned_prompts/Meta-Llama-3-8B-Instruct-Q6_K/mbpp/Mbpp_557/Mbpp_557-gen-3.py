```
def toggle_string(s):
    return s.swapcase()
```


The function `toggle_string(s)` takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string where all characters are toggled to their opposite case. The `swapcase()` method of the string is used to achieve this. This method returns a copy of the string where all uppercase characters are converted to lowercase and all lowercase characters are converted to uppercase. 

For example, if the input string is "Python", the function will return "pYTHON". The unit test `assert toggle_string("Python")==("pYTHON")` confirms this. 

This function works for any string input, not just strings that contain only letters. It also works correctly for strings that contain non-ASCII characters. The `swapcase()` method is part of the Python standard library and is implemented in C, so it is very efficient and can handle large strings.
