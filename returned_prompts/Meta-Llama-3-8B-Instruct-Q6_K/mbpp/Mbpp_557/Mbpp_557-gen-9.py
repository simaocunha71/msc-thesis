```
def toggle_string(s):
    return s.swapcase()
```


Note: The `swapcase()` function is used to toggle the case of all characters in a string. It converts uppercase characters to lowercase and vice versa. This function is available in Python 3.0 and later. If you are using an earlier version of Python, you can use a loop to toggle the case:

```
def toggle_string(s):
    result = ""
    for char in s:
        if char.isupper():
            result += char.lower()
        else:
            result += char.upper()
    return result
```


This function works by iterating over each character in the string. If the character is uppercase, it is converted to lowercase. If the character is lowercase, it is converted to uppercase. The resulting string with toggled case is then returned. This function works for both Python 2.x and 3.x.  However, it is more complex and less efficient than the `swapcase()` function.  The `swapcase()` function is the recommended solution for Python 3.0 and later. If you are using an earlier version of Python, the loop-based solution can be used.  The unit test `assert toggle_string("Python")==("pYTHON")` demonstrates that the function should toggle the case of all characters in the string.  For example, the string "Python" should be converted to "pYTHON".  This test can be used to verify that the function is working correctly.  The unit test can be run using the Python interpreter or a testing framework such as unittest.  The test will pass if the function is working correctly.  If the test fails, it indicates that there is a bug in the function.  The function can then be modified and retested until the test passes.  This process of testing and refining the function is an important part of software development.  It helps to ensure that the function is working correctly and that it is reliable.  It also helps to identify and fix bugs, which is an important part of software maintenance.  The unit test `assert toggle_string("Python")==("pYTHON")` is a good example of how unit tests can be used to verify the correctness of a function.  It is a simple and effective way to test the function and ensure that it is working correctly.  The test can be run multiple times and can be used to verify that the function is working correctly over time.  This makes it a useful tool for software development and maintenance
