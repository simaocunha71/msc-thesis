```
def toggle_string(s):
    return s.swapcase()
```
The function `toggle_string` takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string where all characters are toggled in case. The `swapcase` method is used to achieve this. It swaps the case of each character in the string. For example, if the input string is "Python", the output will be "pYTHON". 

This function will pass the given unit test:
```
assert toggle_string("Python")==("pYTHON")
```  ```python

    return s.swapcase()
