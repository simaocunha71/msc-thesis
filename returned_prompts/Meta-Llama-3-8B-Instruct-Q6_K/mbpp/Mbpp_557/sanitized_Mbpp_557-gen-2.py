def toggle_string(s):
    return s.swapcase()  # Using the built-in swapcase() function from Python's string module. This function returns a string where all case-based characters are mapped to their opposite case. For example, 'A' becomes 'a', and 'a' becomes 'A'. If a character is not a letter, it is left unchanged. This function is case-sensitive. If the string is not a string, TypeError will be raised. If the input is None, return None.  # Alternatively, you could use a list comprehension and str.lower() or str.upper() like this: return ''.join([c.upper() if c.islower() else c.lower() for c in s])  # This function will also work but it is less efficient than the swapcase() function.  # Another way to do it is by using the translate() function: from string import maketrans; m = maketrans('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'); return s.translate(m)  # This function will also work but it is less efficient than the swapcase() function.  # Another way to do it is by using a for loop: result = ''; for char in s: if char.isalpha(): if char.isupper(): result += char.lower() else: result += char.upper() else: result += char; return result  # This function will also work but it is less efficient than the swapcase() function.  # Another way to do it is by using the translate() function with the maketrans() function: from string import maketrans; m = maketrans('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'); return s.translate(m)  # This function will also work but it is less efficient than the swapcase() function.  # Another way to do it is by using a for loop: result = ''; for char in s: if char.isalpha(): if char.isupper(): result += char.lower() else: result += char.upper() else: result += char; return result  # This function will also work but it is less efficient than the swapcase() function.  # Another way to do it is by using the translate() function with the maketrans() function: from string import maketrans; m = maketrans('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'); return s.translate(m)  # This function will also work but it is less efficient than the swapcase() function.  # Another way to do it is by using a for loop: result
