def toggle_string(s):
    return s.swapcase()
```  # use the built-in string method swapcase()
```
Explanation:
The problem is asking to create a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string where all characters are toggled (i.e., lowercase becomes uppercase and vice versa).
The provided unit test `assert toggle_string("Python")==("pYTHON")` indicates that the function should return "pYTHON" when given "Python" as input.
To solve this problem, we can use the built-in `swapcase()` method in Python, which is specifically designed for this purpose. It swaps the case of all characters in the string, making it a suitable solution for this problem. The function `toggle_string(s)` simply calls the `swapcase()` method on the input string `s` and returns the result.```python
```  # use the built-in string method swapcase()
```
