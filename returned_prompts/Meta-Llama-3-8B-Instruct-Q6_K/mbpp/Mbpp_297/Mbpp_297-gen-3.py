```
def flatten_list(nested_list):
    result = []
    for element in nested_list:
        if isinstance(element, list):
            result.extend(flatten_list(element))
        else:
            result.append(element)
    return result
```


The unit test provided helps clarify the expected behavior of the function. It shows that the function should recursively iterate through the nested list, adding each element to the result list. The function should also handle sublists of arbitrary depth.

Here's an explanation of the solution:

1. Initialize an empty list `result` that will store the flattened list.
2. Iterate through each element in the input `nested_list`.
3. If the element is a list (i.e., it's a sublist), recursively call the `flatten_list` function on that sublist and extend the `result` list with the returned list.
4. If the element is not a list (i.e., it's an atomic value), simply append it to the `result` list.
5. Return the `result` list, which now contains the flattened list.

The unit test provided helps ensure that the function behaves correctly by checking that the output matches the expected result. The test covers a variety of cases, including sublists of different depths and atomic values. By passing this test, we can be confident that the function is working as intended.
