def flatten_list(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for element in nested_list:
        if isinstance(element, list):
            flat_list.extend(flatten_list(element))
        else:
            flat_list.append(element)
    return flat_list
```


This function works by iterating over each element in the input list. If the element is a list itself, it recursively calls itself on that list and adds the result to the flat list. If the element is not a list, it simply adds it to the flat list. The result is a flat list containing all the elements from the original nested list structure. 

The unit test provided ensures that the function works correctly by testing it on a specific example. The expected output is a flat list containing all the elements from the input list. The actual output of the function should match this expected output. 

This function assumes that the input is a valid nested list structure. If the input contains other types of objects (e.g., dictionaries, sets, etc.) or is not a list at all, the function may not work correctly. It also assumes that the input does not contain circular references (i.e., a list that contains a reference to itself). If the input contains circular references, the function may go into an infinite loop. 

In general, this function is a simple and efficient way to flatten a nested list structure. It has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the total number of elements in the input list, because it visits each element once. It has a space complexity of O(n) as well, because in the worst case (when the input list is very deep), the function may need to store all the elements in the flat list.
