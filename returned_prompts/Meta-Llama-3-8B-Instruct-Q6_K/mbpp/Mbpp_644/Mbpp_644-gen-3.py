```
def reverse_Array_Upto_K(arr, k):
    return arr[:k][::-1] + arr[k:]
```


Explanation: 
The problem is asking to reverse the array up to a given position and keep the rest of the array as it is. We can achieve this by slicing the array into two parts: the first part up to the given position and the second part from the given position to the end. Then we reverse the first part and concatenate the two parts together. The slicing operation `arr[:k]` gives us the first part and `arr[k:]` gives us the second part. The `[::-1]` slice is used to reverse the first part. 

The unit test `assert reverse_Array_Upto_K([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],4) == [4, 3, 2, 1, 5, 6]` helps to clarify the problem. It shows that the function should reverse the array up to the 4th position and keep the rest of the array as it is. The result is `[4, 3, 2, 1, 5, 6]`. 

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the array. The space complexity is O(1), as we are not using any extra space that scales with the input size.
