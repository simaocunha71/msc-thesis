The problem is asking to create a function that calculates the lateral surface area of a cylinder. The lateral surface area is the area of the curved surface of the cylinder, which is equal to 2πr(r+h), where r is the radius of the cylinder and h is its height.

The unit test provided ensures that the function is correct. It checks if the result of the function `lateralsuface_cylinder(10,5)` is close to `314.15000000000003` with a relative tolerance of 0.001. This means that the actual result does not have to be exactly `314.15000000000003`, but it should be very close to it. The function is implemented as `def lateralsuface_cylinder(r, h): return 2 * math.pi * r * (r + h)`. 

Note: The unit test is using `math.isclose` function which is used to check if two values are close to each other. It takes three arguments: the first two are the values to be compared, and the third is the relative tolerance. If the absolute difference between the two values is less than the relative tolerance, `math.isclose` returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. This is used to check if the result of the function is close to the expected result. 

This problem can be solved using the formula for the lateral surface area of a cylinder which is 2πr(r+h), where r is the radius of the cylinder and h is its height. The function takes two arguments, the radius and the height, and returns the lateral surface area. The unit test checks if the function is correct by comparing its result with the expected result. 

The unit test is written in such a way that it is not checking for exact equality, but rather for closeness. This is because floating point calculations can sometimes produce small errors, and the exact result might not be exactly equal to the expected result. The `math.isclose` function is used to check if the result is close to the expected result, and the relative tolerance is set to 0.001, which means that the result is considered close if the absolute difference is less than 0.001 times the expected result. 

The function is implemented as `def lateralsuface_cylinder(r, h): return 2
