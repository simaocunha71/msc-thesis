    return 2 * math.pi * radius * height
```


The problem is asking to write a function that calculates the lateral surface area of a cylinder. The lateral surface area is the area of the curved side of the cylinder.

The function should take two parameters: the radius of the cylinder and its height. It should return the lateral surface area.

The unit test provided helps to clarify the problem by showing the expected output for a specific input. The test checks that the lateral surface area of a cylinder with a radius of 10 and a height of 5 is approximately 314.15. This is the correct value for a cylinder with these dimensions.

The solution to the problem is a simple function that uses the formula for the lateral surface area of a cylinder: 2 * π * radius * height. This formula is derived from the fact that the curved side of the cylinder is a rectangle with a width equal to the circumference of the base and a height equal to the height of the cylinder. The circumference of the base is 2 * π * radius, so the lateral surface area is 2 * π * radius * height. This formula is used in the solution to the problem.
