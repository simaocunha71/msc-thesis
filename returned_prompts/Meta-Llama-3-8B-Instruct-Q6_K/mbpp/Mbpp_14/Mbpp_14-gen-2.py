```
def find_Volume(base, height, depth):
    return (base * height * depth) / 2
```


The provided unit test `assert find_Volume(10,8,6) == 240` suggests that the function should calculate the volume of a triangular prism. The volume of a triangular prism is given by the formula `(base * height * depth) / 2`, where `base` is the base area of the triangle, `height` is the height of the triangle, and `depth` is the depth of the prism. This formula is used in the provided function `find_Volume`.
