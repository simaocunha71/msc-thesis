def find_Volume(base, height, depth):
    return (base * height * depth) / 2
``` 

This function calculates the volume of a triangular prism given its base, height, and depth. The volume of a triangular prism is calculated by multiplying the base area with the height, and then dividing the result by 2. 

The unit test `assert find_Volume(10,8,6) == 240` ensures that the function is working correctly. 

Please note that the function assumes that the base is a triangle, and the height is the distance from the base to the top of the prism. The depth is the distance from the base to the opposite face of the prism.
