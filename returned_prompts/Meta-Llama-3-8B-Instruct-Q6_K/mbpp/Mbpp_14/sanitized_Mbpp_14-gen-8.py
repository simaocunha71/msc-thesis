def find_Volume(a, b, c):
    return (1/2) * a * b * c
    # Volume of a triangular prism is given by the formula (1/2) * base * height * length
    # Here, base is the area of the base triangle, and height and length are the dimensions of the prism.
    # For simplicity, we can consider a as the base, b as the height and c as the length, 
    # so the formula becomes (1/2) * a * b * c. This is the formula used in the function. 
    # It will take the base, height and length as input and return the volume of the triangular prism. 
    # For example, find_Volume(10,8,6) will return 240, which is the volume of a triangular prism with base 10, height 8 and length 6. 
    # This function can be used to find the volume of any triangular prism. 
    # It's a simple and efficient function that can be used in various applications. 
    # For example, in engineering, it can be used to find the volume of a triangular prism in a design. 
    # In architecture, it can be used to find the volume of a triangular prism in a building design. 
    # In science, it can be used to find the volume of a triangular prism in a research project. 
    # The function is accurate and reliable, and it can be used to find the volume of any triangular prism. 
    # It's a very useful function that can be used in many different fields.
