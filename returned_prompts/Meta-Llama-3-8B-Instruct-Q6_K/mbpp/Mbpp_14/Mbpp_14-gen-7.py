```
def find_Volume(base, height, depth):
    return (base * height * depth) / 2
```
The problem is asking you to write a function that calculates the volume of a triangular prism. The volume of a triangular prism is calculated by multiplying the base area of the triangle by the height of the prism. The base area of the triangle is calculated by multiplying the base by the height of the triangle, and then dividing by 2. 

The unit test `assert find_Volume(10,8,6) == 240` helps to clarify the problem by providing an example of the function being used with specific values. 

The function `find_Volume` takes three arguments: `base`, `height`, and `depth`. It returns the volume of the triangular prism, which is calculated by multiplying the base area of the triangle by the height of the prism. The base area of the triangle is calculated by multiplying the base by the height of the triangle, and then dividing by 2. 

Here is the solution in Python:
```
def find_Volume(base, height, depth):
    return (base * height * depth) / 2
```  ```
