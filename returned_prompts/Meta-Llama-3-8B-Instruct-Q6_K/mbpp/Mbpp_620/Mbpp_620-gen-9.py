            max_length += 1

The problem is asking for a function that finds the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair of numbers in the subset is divisible. 

The given unit test suggests that we need to find the longest increasing subsequence of the list of numbers, and each number in the subsequence should be divisible by the previous number. 

Here is a Python solution for this problem. It sorts the list of numbers and then iterates over the list. For each number, it checks if the current number is divisible by the sum of the current number and the previous number. If it is, it adds the current number to the current sum and increases the length of the subset by 1. If it's not, it resets the current sum to the current number and resets the length of the subset to 1. 

The function returns the length of the longest subset found. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the length of the list of numbers. The space complexity is O(1) as it only uses a constant amount of space. 

Note that this solution assumes that the input list contains at least one number. If the input list can be empty, you may want to add a check for this at the beginning of the function. 

Also, this solution only works correctly if the input list contains at least one pair of numbers that are divisible. If the input list does not contain any such pair, the function will return 1, which may not be the correct answer. If you want to handle this case differently, you will need to modify the function accordingly.
