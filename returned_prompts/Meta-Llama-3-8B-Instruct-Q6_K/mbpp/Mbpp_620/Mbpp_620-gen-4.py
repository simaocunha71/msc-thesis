The given problem is to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is not divisible. In other words, the problem is asking for the size of the largest subset of numbers where no two numbers are relatively prime.

The function `largest_subset` takes a list of numbers as input and returns the size of the largest subset of numbers where every pair is not divisible.

The function uses a helper function `gcd` to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. The `gcd` function is memoized using the `@lru_cache` decorator from the `functools` module to avoid redundant calculations.

The function then iterates over the list of numbers and for each number, it checks all the remaining numbers to see if they are not relatively prime with the current number. If they are not relatively prime, it increments the size of the current subset.

Finally, the function returns the maximum size of the subset found.

The unit test `assert largest_subset([ 1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18 ]) == 4` helps to clarify the problem and ensures that the function is working correctly. The expected output of the function for the input `[ 1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18 ]` is 4, which is the size of the largest subset of numbers where every pair is not divisible. The subset is `[ 6, 18, 13, 17 ]`.
