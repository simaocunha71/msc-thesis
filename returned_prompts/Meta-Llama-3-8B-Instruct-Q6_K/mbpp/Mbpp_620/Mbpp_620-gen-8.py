The problem is asking to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair in the subset is divisible. This problem can be solved by using a greedy approach. 

First, we sort the list of numbers. Then, we iterate over the sorted list and add the numbers to our subset as long as they are divisible. 

Here is the Python code to solve this problem:

```
def largest_subset(numbers):
    numbers.sort()
    subset = [numbers[0]]
    count = 1
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        if numbers[i] % subset[-1] == 0:
            subset.append(numbers[i])
            count += 1
    return count
```

This function sorts the list of numbers, then iterates over the sorted list. It adds each number to the subset as long as it is divisible by the last number in the subset. The function returns the size of the largest subset.

The unit test `assert largest_subset([ 1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18 ]) == 4` helps to clarify the problem by providing an example of the expected output. It shows that the largest subset that satisfies the condition is `[1, 3, 6, 18]`, which has a size of 4. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the number of elements in the input list. The space complexity is O(n) as we need to store the subset of numbers.
