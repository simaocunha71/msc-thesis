"""
This problem is asking you to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair of numbers in the subset is divisible. 

The given unit test suggests that the list of numbers is given, and we need to find the size of the largest subset. 

Here's a Python solution for this problem:

```
def largest_subset(nums):
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)
```

This function sorts the list of numbers and then uses dynamic programming to find the size of the largest subset. It keeps track of the maximum size of the subset ending at each number, and finally returns the maximum size. The time complexity is O(n^2), where n is the length of the list of numbers. 

This solution assumes that the list of numbers is not empty and does not contain duplicate numbers. If these assumptions are not valid, additional checks should be added to the function. 

For example, if the list of numbers can be empty, you should add a check at the beginning of the function to return 0 if the list is empty. If the list can contain duplicate numbers, you should add a check to ignore duplicate numbers in the dynamic programming part of the function. 

Also note that this solution does not guarantee that the largest subset it finds is unique. If uniqueness is required, you would need to modify the function to keep track of the actual subset, not just its size. 

Finally, this solution is not very efficient if the list of numbers is very large. In such cases, you may want to consider using a more efficient algorithm or data structure, such as a trie or a suffix tree. """
