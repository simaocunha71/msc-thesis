# It's a good practice to add test cases to ensure your function works correctly. 
# In this case, the test case checks if the function correctly converts a list to a tuple. 
# If the test case passes, it means the function is working correctly. 
# If the test case fails, it means there's an error in the function.  # The function works by directly converting the list to a tuple. 
# The tuple function in Python takes an iterable (like a list) as an argument and returns a tuple. 
# It does not modify the original list. 
# The function is very simple and easy to understand. 
# It's a good practice to write test cases for your functions to ensure they work correctly. 
# This helps to catch errors early and makes your code more reliable.
