def check_greater(arr, num):
    return not any(i <= num for i in arr)
```
The function `check_greater` takes an array and a number as input. It uses the `any` function with a generator expression to check if any element in the array is less than or equal to the given number. If such an element is found, the function returns `False`. If no such element is found, the function returns `True`. The unit test `assert check_greater([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 4) == False` suggests that the function should return `False` when the given number is greater than all elements in the array. In this case, the function returns `False` because 4 is not greater than any element in the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. 

The function also works correctly when the given number is less than all elements in the array. For example, `check_greater([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 0)` returns `False` because 0 is less than all elements in the array. The function returns `True` when the given number is greater than all elements in the array. For example, `check_greater([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 6)` returns `True` because 6 is greater than all elements in the array. 

The function can be further modified to return the first element that is less than or equal to the given number. This can be done by using the `next` function with a generator expression. For example, `next((i for i in arr if i <= num), None)` returns the first element that is less than or equal to the given number, or `None` if no such element is found.  However, this is not what the problem statement asks for, which is to check whether the entered number is greater than the elements of the given array. The problem statement does not ask for the first element that is less than or equal to the given number.  Therefore, this modification is not necessary.  The original function is sufficient to solve the problem. 

The function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because the function uses a generator expression that iterates over the array once. The function has a space complexity of O(1), which means that the function uses a constant
