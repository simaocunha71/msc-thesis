```
def check_greater(arr, num):
    for i in arr:
        if i > num:
            return False
    return True
```


The function takes two parameters, an array and a number. It iterates over each element in the array. If any element is greater than the given number, it returns False. If it checks all elements and finds no element greater than the given number, it returns True. This is according to the problem statement, which requires the function to return False if the number is greater than any element in the array, and True otherwise. The unit test `assert check_greater([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 4) == False` suggests that the function should return False when the number is 4 because it is greater than some elements in the array. 

However, this solution is incorrect because it returns True when the number is greater than all elements in the array. For example, if the array is [1, 2, 3] and the number is 4, the function should return False because the number is greater than all elements in the array. 

A correct solution would be to return True only when the number is not greater than any element in the array. 

Here is the correct solution:
```
def check_greater(arr, num):
    for i in arr:
        if i > num:
            return False
    return True
```
