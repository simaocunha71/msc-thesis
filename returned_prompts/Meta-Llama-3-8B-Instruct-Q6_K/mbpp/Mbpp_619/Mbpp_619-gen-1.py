"""
The problem is asking to write a function that takes a string as input and moves all the numbers in the string to the end. 
The numbers can be of any length and can appear anywhere in the string.

The unit test `assert move_num('I1love143you55three3000thousand') == 'Iloveyouthreethousand1143553000'` helps in understanding the problem better.

Here's a Python solution for the problem:

```
def move_num(s):
    num_str = ''
    result = ''
    for char in s:
        if char.isdigit():
            num_str += char
        else:
            result += char
    return result + num_str
```

This function goes through each character in the string. If the character is a digit, it adds it to `num_str`. If the character is not a digit, it adds it to `result`. Finally, it returns `result` concatenated with `num_str`. This way, all the numbers in the string are moved to the end.```python
