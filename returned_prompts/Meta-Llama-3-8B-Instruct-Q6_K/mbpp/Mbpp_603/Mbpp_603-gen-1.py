The problem is asking to create a function that generates all lucid numbers (numbers that are not divisible by 2 or 3) smaller than or equal to a given integer.

The unit test `assert get_lucid(10) == [1, 2, 3, 5, 7]` suggests that the function should return all lucid numbers up to the given integer.

Here is a Python solution for the problem:
```
def get_lucid(n):
    lucid_numbers = []
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if i % 2 != 0 and i % 3 != 0:
            lucid_numbers.append(i)
    return lucid_numbers
```
