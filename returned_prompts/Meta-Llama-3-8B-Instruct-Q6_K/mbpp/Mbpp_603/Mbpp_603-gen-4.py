```
def get_ludic(n):
    lucid_nums = [i for i in range(1, n+1) if all(i % j != 0 for j in range(2, int(i**0.5) + 1))]
    return lucid_nums
```


The problem is asking to write a function that returns all the lucid numbers that are smaller than or equal to a given integer. A lucid number is a number that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

The unit test `assert get_ludic(10) == [1, 2, 3, 5, 7]` helps to clarify the problem by providing an example of what the function should return.

Here is the solution:
```
def get_ludic(n):
    lucid_nums = [i for i in range(1, n+1) if all(i % j != 0 for j in range(2, int(i**0.5) + 1))]
    return lucid_nums
```
This function uses a list comprehension to generate the lucid numbers. It iterates over the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive), and for each number `i`, it checks if it has no divisors other than 1 and itself. This is done using the `all` function and a generator expression that checks if `i` is not divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of `i` (inclusive). The resulting list of lucid numbers is then returned.
