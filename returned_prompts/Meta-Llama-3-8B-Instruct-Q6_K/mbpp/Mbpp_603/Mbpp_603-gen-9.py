```
def get_ludic(n):
    lucid_numbers = []
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if all(i % j for j in range(2, int(i**0.5) + 1)):
            lucid_numbers.append(i)
    return lucid_numbers
```


The problem asks to write a function that returns all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to a given integer. A lucid number is a number that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

The unit test `assert get_ludic(10) == [1, 2, 3, 5, 7]` suggests that we should return all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to the given integer.

Here is the solution in Python:

The function `get_ludic` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to `n`. It iterates over all numbers from 1 to `n` and checks if each number is lucid by using the `all` function with a generator expression. The generator expression checks if the number has any divisors other than 1 and itself by iterating over all numbers from 2 to the square root of the number (inclusive). If a number is lucid, it is added to the list `lucid_numbers`. Finally, the function returns the list of lucid numbers.

For example, `get_ludic(10)` returns `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7]`, which are all the lucid numbers smaller than or equal to 10.
