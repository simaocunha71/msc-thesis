```
def get_ludic(n):
    lucid_numbers = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if all(i % j != 0 for j in range(2, int(i ** 0.5) + 1)):
            lucid_numbers.append(i)
    return lucid_numbers

The problem asks to create a function that returns all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to a given integer. A lucid number is a number that is not divisible by any number except for 1 and itself.

The unit test provided, `assert get_lucid(10) == [1, 2, 3, 5, 7]`, helps to clarify the definition of lucid numbers.

Here's the solution in Python. The function `get_ludic` iterates over all numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and checks if each number is lucid by verifying that it is not divisible by any number except for 1 and itself. If a number is lucid, it is added to the list `lucid_numbers`. Finally, the function returns the list of lucid numbers. 

The `all` function is used to check if a condition is true for all elements in an iterable. In this case, it checks if `i` is not divisible by any number `j` in the range from 2 to the square root of `i` (inclusive). The `int(i ** 0.5) + 1` expression is used to calculate the square root of `i` and add 1 to it, as the square root of `i` is an upper bound for the numbers that might divide `i`. 

The function returns the list of lucid numbers. The unit test `assert get_ludic(10) == [1, 2, 3, 5, 7]` ensures that the function works correctly. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(n sqrt(n)) due to the nested loops. However, it is efficient for small values of `n`. For larger values of `n`, a more efficient algorithm would be needed. 

For example, you could use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate all prime numbers up to `n` and then filter out the numbers that are not lucid. This would reduce the time complexity to O(n log log n). 

Here's the modified function using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm:
