```
def get_ludic(n):
    lucid_numbers = [i for i in range(1, n+1) if all(i % j != 0 for j in range(2, i))]
    return lucid_numbers
```


The problem is asking to create a function that returns all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to a given integer. A lucid number is a number that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

The unit test provided helps in understanding the problem better. The test `assert get_lucid(10) == [1, 2, 3, 5, 7]` shows that the function should return all lucid numbers up to and including 10.

The solution uses a list comprehension to generate the lucid numbers. It iterates over the range from 1 to the given integer (inclusive) and checks if the number has any divisors other than 1 and itself. If not, it is a lucid number and is added to the list.

Here's the Python code for the solution:
```
def get_ludic(n):
    lucid_numbers = [i for i in range(1, n+1) if all(i % j != 0 for j in range(2, i))]
    return lucid_numbers
```
This function works by iterating over the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive), and for each number `i` in that range, it checks if `i` is not divisible by any number `j` in the range from 2 to `i-1` (inclusive). If `i` is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is a lucid number and is added to the list. The function then returns the list of lucid numbers.
