The problem is asking to find all the lucid numbers smaller than or equal to a given integer. A lucid number is a number that has the same number of divisors as its digit sum.

We can solve this problem by first defining a function to calculate the digit sum of a number, and then another function to check if a number is lucid. The main function would then iterate over all numbers from 1 to the given integer, check if each number is lucid, and add it to the result list if it is.

Here is the solution:

```
def get_digit_sum(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))

def is_lucid(n):
    return get_digit_sum(n) == len([i for i in range(1, n + 1) if n % i == 0])

def get_ludic(n):
    return [i for i in range(1, n + 1) if is_lucid(i)]
```

The unit test `assert get_ludic(10) == [1, 2, 3, 5, 7]` ensures that the function is working correctly. It checks if the output of the `get_ludic` function with input 10 is equal to the list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7]`. If the function is working correctly, this test will pass. If not, it will raise an AssertionError.
