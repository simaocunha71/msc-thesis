def get_ludic(n):

    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if all(i % j != 0 for j in range(2, int(i**0.5) + 1)):

The provided unit test `assert get_ludic(10) == [1, 2, 3, 5, 7]` helps in understanding the problem better. It suggests that the function should return all lucid numbers up to the given integer. 

A lucid number is a number that has no divisors other than 1 and itself. For example, the first few lucid numbers are 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, etc.

The function `get_ludic(n)` iterates over all numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and checks if each number has any divisors other than 1 and itself. If not, it adds the number to a set of lucid numbers. Finally, it returns the sorted list of lucid numbers.

The unit test `assert get_ludic(10) == [1, 2, 3, 5, 7]` ensures that the function works correctly. It checks if the function returns the correct list of lucid numbers up to 10. If the function is correct, it should return `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7]`. If the function is incorrect, it will raise an AssertionError. 

The function uses a set to store the lucid numbers, which automatically removes duplicates and provides an efficient way to check if a number is in the set. The `all` function is used to check if a number has any divisors other than 1 and itself. The `int(i**0.5) + 1` expression is used to optimize the check for divisors, as a larger divisor of `i` must be a multiple of a smaller divisor that has already been checked. 

The function finally returns the sorted list of lucid numbers. This ensures that the output is always in a consistent order, which is important for testing and debugging purposes. 

The time complexity of the function is O(n sqrt(n)), where n is the input number. This is because the function iterates over all numbers up to `n` and checks each number for divisors up to
