def get_ludic(n):
    return [i for i in range(1, n+1) if bin(i).count('1') == 1]  # bin(i) converts i to binary and count('1') counts the number of '1's in the binary representation. A number is lucid if it has exactly one '1' in its binary representation.  # This function is not efficient for large values of n because it needs to convert each number to binary.  # A more efficient approach is to check if a number is lucid by checking its binary representation as follows:  # A number is lucid if and only if it is of the form 2^k - 1 for some integer k.  # Therefore, we can generate lucid numbers using a loop:  def get_ludic(n):     lucid_nums = []     k = 1     while (1 << k) - 1 <= n:         lucid_nums.append((1 << k) - 1)         k += 1     return lucid_nums  # This function generates all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to n.  # It uses a loop to generate lucid numbers.  # The loop runs until the next lucid number exceeds n.  # In each iteration, it appends the current lucid number to the result list and increments k by 1.  # The function returns the result list.  # This function is more efficient than the previous one for large values of n.  # It only needs to perform a constant number of operations for each lucid number, whereas the previous function needs to convert each number to binary.  # Therefore, the time complexity of this function is O(n), whereas the time complexity of the previous function is O(n log n) in the worst case.  # This function is also more space-efficient than the previous one, because it only needs to store the lucid numbers in a list, whereas the previous function needs to store the binary representations of all numbers in a list.  # Therefore, the space complexity of this function is O(n), whereas the space complexity of the previous function is O(n log n) in the worst case.  # In summary, this function is more efficient and space-efficient than the previous one for large values of n.  # It uses a loop to generate lucid numbers and appends each lucid number to the result list.  # The function returns the result list.  # This function
