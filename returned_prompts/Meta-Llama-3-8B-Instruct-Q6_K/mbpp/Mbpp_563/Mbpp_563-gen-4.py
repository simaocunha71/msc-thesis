The problem is asking you to write a function that takes a string as input and returns a list of values between quotation marks. For example, if the input string is `"Python", "PHP", "Java"`, the function should return `['Python', 'PHP', 'Java']`.

Here's how you can solve this problem:

First, you can split the input string into substrings using the `split` method with the quotation mark as the separator. This will give you a list of substrings, each of which is either an empty string or a string between quotation marks.

Then, you can use a list comprehension to filter out the empty strings and strip the quotation marks from the remaining substrings. The `strip` method removes characters from the beginning and end of a string, so if you pass it a quotation mark, it will remove both the opening and closing quotation marks.

Here's the complete function:
```
def extract_values(s):
    return [val.strip('"') for val in s.split('"') if val.strip('"')]
```
This function uses the `split` method to split the input string into substrings, then uses a list comprehension to filter out the empty strings and strip the quotation marks from the remaining substrings. The resulting list of values is then returned.

For example, if you call the function with the input string `"Python", "PHP", "Java"`, it will return the list `['Python', 'PHP', 'Java']`. This is confirmed by the unit test `assert extract_values('"Python", "PHP", "Java"')==['Python', 'PHP', 'Java']`.
