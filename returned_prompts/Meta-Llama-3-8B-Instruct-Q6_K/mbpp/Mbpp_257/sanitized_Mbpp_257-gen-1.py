def swap_numbers(a, b):
    return (b, a)  # return a tuple with b as the first element and a as the second element
    # python's tuple unpacking is used to swap the variables in a single line, but in this case, 
    # we can simply return a tuple with the numbers in the desired order.  # return (b, a)  # return a tuple with b as the first element and a as the second element
