```
def swap_numbers(a, b):
    return (b, a)
```
This function takes two numbers, a and b, and returns a tuple with b as the first element and a as the second element. 

For example, if you call `swap_numbers(10,20)`, it will return `(20,10)`, which is the expected output. 

The unit test `assert swap_numbers(10,20)==(20,10)` also confirms this. 
```python
assert swap_numbers(10,20)==(20,10)
``` 
It checks if the output of `swap_numbers(10,20)` is equal to `(20,10)`, which is indeed the case. 
```python
assert swap_numbers(10,20)==(20,10)  # This assertion passes
```  ```python
assert swap_numbers(10,20)!=(20,10)  # This assertion fails
