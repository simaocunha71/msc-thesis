The problem asks you to write a function that takes two numbers as input and returns a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. 

The unit test `assert swap_numbers(10,20)==(20,10)` clarifies the expected output of the function. 

Here is a Python solution for this problem:
```
def swap_numbers(a, b):
    return (b, a)
```
