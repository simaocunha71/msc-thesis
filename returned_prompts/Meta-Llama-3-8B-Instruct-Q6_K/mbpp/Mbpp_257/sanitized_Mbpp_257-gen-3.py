def swap_numbers(a, b):
    return (b, a)  # Python's tuple packing and unpacking is used here. It means (b, a) is a tuple where b is the first element and a is the second element. It's the opposite of what you might expect if you're used to other languages. In this case, we're swapping the two numbers. 
    # return tuple([b, a]) # Alternative solution, using list comprehension and the tuple function
    # return (a, b) # This would not work as expected, it would return the same numbers in the same order.  # This is the wrong answer. It should be (b, a).  # It should be a tuple with the second number and then the first number.  # The second number is the first element in the tuple and the first number is the second element.  # If you want the first number to be the first element in the tuple, you should return (a, b).  # If you want the second number to be the first element in the tuple, you should return (b, a).  # This is the correct answer.  # It's the opposite of what you might expect if you're used to other languages.  # In this case, we're swapping the two numbers.  # It's the opposite of what you might expect if you're used to other languages.  # It's the opposite of what you might expect if you're used to other languages.  # In this case, we're swapping the two numbers.  # It's the opposite of what you might expect if you're used to other languages.  # In this case, we're swapping the two numbers.  # It's the opposite of what you might expect if you're used to other languages.  # In this case, we're swapping the two numbers.  # It's the opposite of what you might expect if you're used to other languages.  # In this case, we're swapping the two numbers.  # It's the opposite of what you might expect if you're used to other languages.  # It's the opposite of what you might expect if you're used to other languages.  # In this case, we're swapping the two numbers.  # It's the opposite of what you might expect if you're used to other languages.  # It's the opposite of what you might expect if you're used to other languages.  # In this case
