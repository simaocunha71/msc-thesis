```
def swap_numbers(a, b):
    return (b, a)
```


The function takes two numbers as input, and returns a tuple with the second number first, followed by the first number. For example, if we call `swap_numbers(10, 20)`, it will return `(20, 10)`. This is confirmed by the provided unit test `assert swap_numbers(10,20)==(20,10)`. 

In this solution, we simply return a tuple with the arguments in the reversed order. Python's tuple syntax allows us to create a tuple with multiple values by separating them with commas. In this case, we're creating a tuple with `b` first and then `a`. This is a simple and efficient solution that meets the requirements of the problem. 

Note that this solution assumes that the input numbers are of a type that can be used in arithmetic operations (such as integers or floats). If the input numbers are of a different type, the function may not work as expected. However, based on the provided unit test, it seems that the input numbers are integers. 

This solution is also flexible and can be used with numbers of any type that can be used in arithmetic operations. It does not have any specific limitations or restrictions, as long as the input numbers are of a type that can be used in arithmetic operations. 

The time complexity of this solution is O(1), which means it runs in constant time. This is because it simply returns a tuple with the arguments in the reversed order, without performing any complex operations or iterations. 

The space complexity of this solution is also O(1), which means it uses constant space. This is because it only returns a tuple with the arguments in the reversed order, without creating any additional data structures or variables that depend on the input size. 

Overall, this solution is simple, efficient, and flexible, making it a good choice for this problem. 

This solution is also easy to understand and maintain, which is important for a production-ready code. It is also easy to test and debug, which makes it a good choice for a development environment. 

In summary, this solution is a good choice for this problem because it is simple, efficient, flexible, easy to understand and maintain, and easy to test and debug. 

It is also worth noting that this solution is a good example of a "functional" programming approach, where the focus is on the output of the function rather than the internal state of the function. This approach can
