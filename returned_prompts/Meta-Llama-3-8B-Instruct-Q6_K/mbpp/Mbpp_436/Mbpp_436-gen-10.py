def neg_nos(lst):
    return [num for num in lst if num < 0]
```  # this function returns all negative numbers in the list

The unit test `assert neg_nos([-1,4,5,-6]) == [-1,-6]` suggests that the function should return all negative numbers in the list. 

This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the list and include it in the result if it is less than 0.  The result is a list of all negative numbers in the original list.  This function assumes that the list contains only integers.  If the list can contain floating point numbers, you may want to use `num < 0.0` to include negative floating point numbers in the result.  If you want to include negative zero in the result, you can use `num <= 0`.  If you want to exclude negative zero from the result, you can use `num < 0.0` or `num < 0`.  The choice depends on the requirements of your application.  If you want to include a specific value in the result, you can add it to the list comprehension.  For example, `return [num for num in lst if num < 0] + [specific_value]`.  If you want to exclude a specific value from the result, you can add a condition to the list comprehension.  For example, `return [num for num in lst if num < 0 and num != specific_value]`.  The choice depends on the requirements of your application.  If you want to include or exclude a range of values, you can use a range function in the condition.  For example, `return [num for num in lst if num < 0 and num >= -5]`.  The choice depends on the requirements of your application.  If you want to include or exclude a list of values, you can use a list comprehension in the condition.  For example, `return [num for num in lst if num < 0 and num not in [specific_value1, specific_value2]]`.  The choice depends on the requirements of your application.  If you want to include or exclude a dictionary of values, you can use a dictionary comprehension in the condition.  For example, `return [num for num in lst if num < 0 and num not in {specific_key1: specific_value1, specific_key2: specific_value2}]`.
