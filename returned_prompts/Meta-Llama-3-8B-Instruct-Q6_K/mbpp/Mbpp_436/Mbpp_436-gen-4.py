```
The function `neg_nos` takes a list as an argument and returns a new list containing all the negative numbers from the original list. It uses list comprehension to iterate over the input list and includes an element in the output list if it is less than 0. The unit test `assert neg_nos([-1,4,5,-6]) == [-1,-6]` ensures that the function works correctly.  This function is case-insensitive and will return both positive and negative numbers if they are present in the list.  If the input list is empty, the function will return an empty list.  The function also works correctly with lists containing non-integer numbers.  For example, `neg_nos([-1.5,4,5,-6.2])` will return `[-1.5,-6.2]`.   If the list contains no negative numbers, the function will return an empty list.  For example, `neg_nos([1,2,3,4,5])` will return `[]`.  The function is efficient and can handle large lists because it only needs to iterate over the input list once.  It does not modify the original list.  It returns a new list with the negative numbers.  The function is easy to read and understand and can be used in a variety of contexts.  It is a good example of how to use list comprehension in Python.  It is also a good example of how to write a function that filters a list based on a condition.  It is a good example of how to write a function that returns a new list instead of modifying the original list.
