```
def neg_nos(lst):
    return [num for num in lst if num < 0]
```  



Explanation:
The problem is asking for a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list containing only the negative numbers from the original list.

The unit test `assert neg_nos([-1,4,5,-6]) == [-1,-6]` suggests that the function should return a list of negative numbers.

The solution uses a list comprehension to create a new list containing only the numbers from the original list that are less than 0 (i.e., the negative numbers). The function takes a list `lst` as input and returns the list of negative numbers.  



Test:
```
print(neg_nos([-1,4,5,-6]))  # Expected output: [-1, -6]
```  



Output:
```
[-1, -6]
```  



This solution passes the given unit test. It correctly returns a list containing the negative numbers from the input list.  



Note: The solution assumes that the input list contains only integers. If the input list can contain floating-point numbers or non-numeric values, additional checks may be needed.  



Also, the solution returns a list of negative numbers, but the problem statement doesn't specify whether the output should be a list or not. If the problem statement is intended to return a single negative number, the solution would need to be modified accordingly.  



For example, if the input list contains only one negative number, the function could return that number instead of a list.  



Here's an updated solution that returns a single negative number if the input list contains only one negative number:
```
def neg_nos(lst):
    neg_nums = [num for num in lst if num < 0]
    return neg_nums[0] if len(neg_nums) == 1 else neg_nums
```
This updated solution returns a single negative number if the input list contains only one negative number, and returns a list of negative numbers if the input list contains multiple negative numbers.  



However, the original problem statement doesn't specify this requirement, so the original solution is still correct.  



The updated solution is provided for completeness and to demonstrate how the function could be modified to return a single negative number if the input list contains only one negative number.  



In summary, the original solution is correct and passes the given unit test. The updated solution is provided as an alternative that returns a
