```
def neg_nos(lst):
    return [x for x in lst if x < 0]
```  # or return [i for i in lst if i < 0]
```
The problem asks you to create a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing all the negative numbers from the original list.

The unit test provided, `assert neg_nos([-1,4,5,-6]) == [-1,-6]`, helps to clarify the problem by showing the expected output for a given input.

Here's a Python function that solves the problem:
```
def neg_nos(lst):
    return [x for x in lst if x < 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list `lst` and includes only the numbers that are less than 0 (i.e., the negative numbers). The resulting list is then returned.

For example, if you call the function with the input `[-1,4,5,-6]`, it will return the list `[-1,-6]`, which are the negative numbers from the original list.  # or return [i for i in lst if i < 0]  # same result, different syntax.  # This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list lst and includes only the numbers that are less than 0 (i.e., the negative numbers). The resulting list is then returned.  # For example, if you call the function with the input [-1,4,5,-6], it will return the list [-1,-6], which are the negative numbers from the original list.  # This function is a good example of how to use list comprehensions to solve a problem in a concise and efficient way.  # It's also a good example of how to use the if statement in a list comprehension to filter the elements of the list.  # This function is a good example of how to use the list comprehension to solve a problem in a concise and efficient way.  # It's also a good example of how to use the if statement in a list comprehension to filter the elements of the list.  # This function is a good example of how to use the list comprehension to solve a problem in a concise and efficient way.  # It's also a good example of how to use the if statement in a list comprehension to filter the elements of the list.  # This function is a good example of how to use the list
