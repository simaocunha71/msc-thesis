This problem is asking to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits. 

The approach is to consider the first n bits. There are two options for each bit: 0 or 1. So, the total number of possible sequences for the first n bits is 2^n. 

Now, for the last n bits, we have to make sure that the sum of the first n bits is equal to the sum of the last n bits. This means that the sum of the first n bits should be equal to n. 

So, for the last n bits, we have to make sure that the sum of the bits is n. This is possible only if all the bits are 1. 

So, the total number of sequences is 2^n. 

The base case is when n is 0. In this case, there is only one sequence: all bits are 0. 

The time complexity is O(n) and the space complexity is O(1). 

The unit test `assert math.isclose(count_binary_seq(1), 2.0, rel_tol=0.001)` is to check if the function is correct. It checks if the count of binary sequences of length 2 for n=1 is close to 2.0.  The `math.isclose` function is used to check if two numbers are close to each other. The `rel_tol` parameter is used to specify the relative tolerance. In this case, it is set to 0.001. This means that the function will pass the test if the count is between 1.999 and 2.001. 

Note: The problem statement is not clear about whether the first and last n bits are considered separately or together. But, based on the unit test, it seems that the first and last n bits are considered together. If they are considered separately, then the problem becomes more complex and the solution would be different.
