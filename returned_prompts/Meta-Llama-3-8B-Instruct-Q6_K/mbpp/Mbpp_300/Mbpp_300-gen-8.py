The problem is asking to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that the sum of the first n bits is the same as the sum of the last n bits. 

The problem can be solved using dynamic programming. We can calculate the count of sequences for each subproblem and store the result. The base case is when n is 1, in which case the count is 2. For larger n, the count is twice the count of sequences for n-1. 

The unit test `assert math.isclose(count_binary_seq(1), 2.0, rel_tol=0.001)` helps to clarify the problem by providing an expected output for the base case. 

The function `count_binary_seq(n)` returns the count of binary sequences of length 2n such that the sum of the first n bits is the same as the sum of the last n bits. 

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) and the space complexity is O(1).
