The problem is asking to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that the sum of the first n bits is the same as the sum of the last n bits. 

To solve this problem, we need to generate all possible binary sequences of length 2n and then count the number of sequences for which the sum of the first n bits is the same as the sum of the last n bits.

Here is a Python solution using recursion:

```
import math

def count_binary_seq(n):
    def count_helper(k, n, count):
        if k == 0:
            return count
        return count_helper(k-1, n, count + (1 if k <= n else -1) * 2**(n-k))

    return count_helper(n, n, 0)
```

This function uses a helper function to recursively generate all possible binary sequences and count the number of sequences for which the sum of the first n bits is the same as the sum of the last n bits. The helper function takes three parameters: k (the current position in the sequence), n (the length of the sequence), and count (the current count of sequences). If k is 0, it means we have generated a complete sequence of length 2n, so we return the count. Otherwise, we recursively call the helper function with k-1 and update the count based on the current position in the sequence.

The unit test `assert math.isclose(count_binary_seq(1), 2.0, rel_tol=0.001)` suggests that the function should return 2.0 for n=1, which is the correct count of binary sequences of length 2 for which the sum of the first bit is the same as the sum of the last bit. 

This function has a time complexity of O(2^n) because it recursively generates all possible binary sequences of length 2n. The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the count and the current position in the sequence. 

Note that this function may take a long time to run for large values of n because it has to generate all possible binary sequences of length 2n. For large values of n, a more efficient solution may be needed.
