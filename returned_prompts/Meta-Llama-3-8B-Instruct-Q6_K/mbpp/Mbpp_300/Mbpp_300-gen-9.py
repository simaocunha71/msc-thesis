The problem asks to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that the sum of the first n bits is the same as the sum of the last n bits. 

The key insight here is that the problem is equivalent to finding the number of binary sequences of length 2n where the first n bits are the same as the last n bits. This is because the sum of the first n bits being equal to the sum of the last n bits implies that the first n bits are the same as the last n bits.

This problem can be solved by using the combination formula. The number of binary sequences of length 2n where the first n bits are the same as the last n bits is equal to the number of ways to choose n bits out of 2n bits, which is given by the combination formula math.comb(2*n, n).

The unit test `assert math.isclose(count_binary_seq(1), 2.0, rel_tol=0.001)` ensures that the function returns the correct count for n=1. The function `count_binary_seq` takes an integer n as input and returns the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that the sum of the first n bits is the same as the sum of the last n bits. 

The function uses the `math.comb` function to calculate the combination, which is a more efficient and accurate way to calculate combinations compared to calculating the combination manually. The `math.isclose` function is used to compare the result with the expected result, with a relative tolerance of 0.001. This is necessary because the result may not be exactly equal to 2.0 due to floating point precision issues. 

The time complexity of this function is O(1) because it uses a constant amount of time to calculate the combination, regardless of the size of the input. The space complexity is also O(1) because it uses a constant amount of space to store the result, regardless of the size of the input. 

Note that the problem statement does not specify whether the input n is 0 or not. However, it is reasonable to assume that the input n is a positive integer, because the problem statement talks about binary sequences of length 2n. In this case, the function `count_binary_seq` will work correctly for all positive integer inputs. If the input n is 0,
