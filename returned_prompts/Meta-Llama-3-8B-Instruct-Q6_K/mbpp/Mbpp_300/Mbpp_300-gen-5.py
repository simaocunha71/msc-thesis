The problem asks to find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that the sum of the first n bits is the same as the sum of the last n bits. 

The unit test `assert math.isclose(count_binary_seq(1), 2.0, rel_tol=0.001)` suggests that the input `n` is a positive integer, and the function should return the count of all binary sequences of length 2n satisfying the given condition.

Here is the Python solution for this problem:

The function `count_binary_seq(n)` iterates over all binary sequences of length 2n. For each sequence, it checks if the sum of the first n bits is the same as the sum of the last n bits. If the condition is met, it increments the count. Finally, the function returns the total count.

The unit test `assert math.isclose(count_binary_seq(1), 2.0, rel_tol=0.001)` checks if the function returns the correct count for the input `n=1`. The function should return 2, which is the count of all binary sequences of length 2 that satisfy the condition. The `math.isclose` function is used to compare the result with the expected value due to floating point precision issues. 

The time complexity of this solution is O(2^n), as it iterates over all binary sequences of length 2n. The space complexity is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the count and the binary sequence.
