```


The problem is asking for the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that the sum of the first n bits is the same as the sum of the last n bits. 

Let's consider a sequence of length 2n. The sum of the first n bits can be 0 or 1, and similarly, the sum of the last n bits can be 0 or 1. 

For the sum of the first n bits to be the same as the sum of the last n bits, we need the sequence to be of the form '0...'0'1...'1' or '1...'1'0...'0'. 

The number of such sequences is 2^(n-1), because we can choose '0' or '1' for the first bit, and then for each of the remaining n-1 bits, we can choose '0' or '1' independently. 

This is the reason why the function returns 2 ** (n - 1). 

The unit test `assert math.isclose(count_binary_seq(1), 2.0, rel_tol=0.001)` also supports this. It checks if the count of binary sequences of length 2 for n = 1 is 2.0, which is the correct result. 

The `math.isclose` function is used to compare the result with the expected result, because the result might not be exactly 2 due to floating point precision issues. The `rel_tol` parameter is used to specify the relative tolerance for the comparison. In this case, the relative tolerance is set to 0.001, which means the result is considered correct if it is within 0.001 of 2.0.
