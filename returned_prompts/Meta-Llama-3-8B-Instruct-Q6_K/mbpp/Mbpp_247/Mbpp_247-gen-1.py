In this problem, we are asked to find the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in a given string. A palindromic subsequence is a subsequence that reads the same backward as forward. For example, in the string "TENS FOR TENS", the longest palindromic subsequence is "TENS" with a length of 5.

The function `lps` takes a string `s` as input and returns the length of the longest palindromic subsequence. It uses dynamic programming to build a 2D table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the substring `s[i..j]`.

The function starts by initializing the diagonal elements of `dp` to 1, since a single character is always a palindrome. Then, it fills up the rest of the table by considering all possible substrings of `s`. If the characters at the beginning and end of a substring match, the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in that substring is the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the substring without the first and last characters plus 2. Otherwise, the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in that substring is the maximum of the lengths of the longest palindromic subsequences in the substrings without the first character and without the last character.

Finally, the function returns the value of `dp[0][n-1]`, which represents the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the entire string `s`. For example, in the string "T
