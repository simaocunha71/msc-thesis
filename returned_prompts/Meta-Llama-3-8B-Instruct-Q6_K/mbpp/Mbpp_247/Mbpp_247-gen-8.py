This function uses dynamic programming to build a 2D table `table` where `table[i][j]` is the length of the longest palindromic subsequence ending at `s[i]` and ending at `s[j]`. The function then iterates over the table to find the maximum length of the longest palindromic subsequence. The function returns the length of the longest palindromic subsequence.

The unit test `assert lps("TENS FOR TENS") == 5` indicates that the longest palindromic subsequence in the string "TENS FOR TENS" is "TENS", which has a length of 5. The function correctly returns 5 for this input.
