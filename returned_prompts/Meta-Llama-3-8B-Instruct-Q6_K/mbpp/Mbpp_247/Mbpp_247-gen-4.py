This problem is asking to find the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the given string. The longest palindromic subsequence (LPS) is a sequence that reads the same backward as forward.

The function `lps(s)` takes a string `s` as input and returns the length of the LPS. It uses dynamic programming to build a table `table` where `table[i][j]` represents the length of the LPS in the substring `s[i..j]`.

The function initializes the table with zeros and then fills it in a bottom-up manner. It starts by initializing the diagonal elements of the table to 1, since a single character is always a palindrome.

Then, it iterates over the table in a bottom-up manner, filling in the elements based on the following rules:

* If the characters at positions `i` and `j` are the same, and `cl` is 2 (i.e., the substring has only two characters), then the length of the LPS is 2.
* If the characters at positions `i` and `j` are the same, then the length of the LPS is the length of the LPS in the substring `s[i+1..j-1]` plus 2.
* Otherwise, the length of the LPS is the maximum of the lengths of the LPS in the substrings `s[i..j-1]` and `s[i+1..j]`.

Finally, the function returns the value of `table[0][n-1]`, which represents the length of the LPS in the entire string.
