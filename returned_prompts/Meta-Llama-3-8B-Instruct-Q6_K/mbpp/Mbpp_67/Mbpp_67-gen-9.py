The Bell numbers are a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the numbers of ways to partition the previous number. For example, the Bell numbers for the first few values of n are 1, 2, 5, 15, 52, 203, 877, 4140, 21147, 115975, 678570, 4213597, 2674440, 1853712.

The function to find the number of ways to partition a set of Bell numbers can be written as follows:

```
def bell_number(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        bell_numbers = [1, 1]
        for i in range(2, n+1):
            bell_numbers.append(sum(bell_numbers[i-1]))
        return bell_numbers[n]
```

This function calculates the Bell number for a given value of n and returns it. The Bell number is calculated by summing up the Bell numbers of the previous numbers. For example, the Bell number for n = 2 is 2, because there are two ways to partition the set {1, 2}: {{1}, {2}} and {{1, 2}}. The Bell number for n = 3 is 5, because there are five ways to partition the set {1, 2, 3}: {{1}, {2}, {3}}, {{1, 2}, {3}}, {{1, 3}, {2}}, {{1}, {2, 3}}, and {{1, 2, 3}}. The Bell number for n = 4 is 15, because there are 15 ways to partition the set {1, 2, 3, 4}.

The unit test `assert bell_number(2)==2` checks that the function correctly calculates the Bell number for n = 2, which is 2. This test ensures that the function is working correctly.
