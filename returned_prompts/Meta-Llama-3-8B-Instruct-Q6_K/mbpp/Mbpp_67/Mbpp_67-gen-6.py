The problem is asking for a function that calculates the number of ways to partition a set of Bell numbers. However, the problem statement lacks clarity on what Bell numbers are and how they are related to the problem.

Fortunately, the unit test `assert bell_number(2)==2` provides a hint. Bell numbers are a sequence of numbers that can be calculated using the formula `B(n) = sum(B(k-1)*choose(n,k-1))`. 

Based on this, we can assume that the input to the function is the number `n` and the function should return the `n`-th Bell number. 

Here's a Python solution for the problem:

```python
from math import comb

def bell_number(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return sum([comb(n-1, k-1)*bell_number(k-1) for k in range(1, n+1)])
```

This function uses recursion to calculate the `n`-th Bell number. It uses the formula `B(n) = sum(B(k-1)*choose(n,k-1))` to calculate the `n`-th Bell number. The `math.comb` function is used to calculate the binomial coefficient `choose(n, k-1)`. The function returns the `n`-th Bell number. 

For example, `bell_number(2)` returns `2`, which is the second Bell number. The first Bell number is `1`, and the second Bell number is `2`. 

This solution assumes that the input `n` is a positive integer. If `n` can be zero or a negative integer, additional checks and handling may be needed. 

Also, note that this solution may not be efficient for large values of `n` due to the recursive nature of the function. A more efficient solution may be needed for large values of `n`.
