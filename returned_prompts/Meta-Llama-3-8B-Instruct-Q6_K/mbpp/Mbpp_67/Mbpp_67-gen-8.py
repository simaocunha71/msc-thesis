The problem is asking to find the number of ways to partition a set of Bell numbers. The Bell number is the number of ways to partition a set of n elements. For example, the Bell number for 2 is 2 because there are 2 ways to partition a set of 2 elements: {{1}, {2}} or {{1,2}}.

Here is a Python function that solves this problem:
```
def bell_number(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return sum(bell_number(i) for i in range(n))
```
This function uses recursion to calculate the Bell number. The base case is when n is 0, in which case the Bell number is 1. Otherwise, the Bell number is the sum of the Bell numbers for all smaller values of n.

For example, bell_number(2) returns 2, which is the correct answer. The function also passes the unit test:
```
assert bell_number(2)==2
```
Note that this function is not efficient for large values of n because it uses recursion and has a time complexity of O(2^n). A more efficient solution would be to use dynamic programming to calculate the Bell numbers. However, this problem is not asking for an efficient solution, so the recursive function is sufficient.
