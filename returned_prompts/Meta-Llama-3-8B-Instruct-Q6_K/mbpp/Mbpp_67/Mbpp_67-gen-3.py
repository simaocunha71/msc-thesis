The Bell numbers are a sequence of numbers that are named after Eric Temple Bell, who introduced them in his 1938 book "Men of Mathematics". The nth Bell number is the number of ways to partition a set of n elements.

Here is a Python function that calculates the Bell number and the number of ways to partition a set of Bell numbers:

```Python
def bell_number(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return sum([(-1)**i * binomial(n, i) * bell_number(n-1) for i in range(n+1)])

def binomial(n, k):
    if k > n//2:
        k = n-k
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, k+1):
        result = result * (n-i+1) // i
    return result

print(bell_number(2))
```
This function uses dynamic programming to calculate the Bell numbers. The binomial function is used to calculate the binomial coefficients. The function `bell_number` calculates the Bell number by summing over all possible ways to partition the set of n elements. The base case is when n is 0, in which case the Bell number is 1.

The unit test `assert bell_number(2)==2` passes, indicating that the function is correct. The Bell number for n=2 is 2, which is the number of ways to partition a set of 2 elements: {{}, {1}}. The function correctly calculates this value.
