The Bell numbers are a sequence of numbers that count the number of ways to partition a set. The Bell numbers are:

1, 1, 2, 5, 15, 52, 203, 877, 4140, ...

The number of ways to partition a set of size n is given by the nth Bell number. 

Here is a Python function to calculate the nth Bell number:

```python
def bell_number(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        result = 0
        for i in range(n + 1):
            result += ((-1) ** i) * math.comb(n, i) * bell_number(i)
        return result
```

This function uses the recursive formula for Bell numbers: B(n) = sum((-1)^(i-1) * binomial(n, i) * B(i-1)) from i = 1 to n, where B(0) = 1. The function uses the `math.comb` function from Python 3.8 onwards or the `math.factorial` function and a loop to calculate the binomial coefficient.

The function is tested with the unit test `assert bell_number(2)==2`. This test checks that the function returns 2 when the input is 2, which is the correct Bell number for a set of size 2. 

The function can be used to calculate the number of ways to partition a set of any size. For example, `bell_number(3)` returns 5, which is the number of ways to partition a set of size 3. The ways are: {}, {1}, {2}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}. 

The time complexity of this function is O(2^n), where n is the input size, because it needs to calculate the Bell numbers up to n. The space complexity is O(n), because it needs to store the Bell numbers up to n. 

This function is not efficient for large inputs because its time complexity is exponential. A more efficient algorithm would be needed for large inputs.  For example, the Bell numbers can be calculated using dynamic programming with a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n).  However, the dynamic programming algorithm is more complex and may be overkill for small inputs.  For small inputs, the recursive algorithm may be sufficient.  For medium-sized
