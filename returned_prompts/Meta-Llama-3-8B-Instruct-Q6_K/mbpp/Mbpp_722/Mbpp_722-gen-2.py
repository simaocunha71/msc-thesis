This function iterates over the dictionary items and checks if the height and weight of each student are above the minimum. If they are, the student's data is included in the new dictionary that is returned. The function is case-sensitive for the student names. If the function is used with the given unit test, it should return {'Cierra Vega': (6.2, 70)}.  If the function is used with other inputs, it should filter the students correctly.  This function does not change the original dictionary.  If the input dictionary is empty, the function will return an empty dictionary.  If there are no students with height and weight above the minimum, the function will also return an empty dictionary.  The function does not sort the students.  The function does not handle the case where the input dictionary is None.  The function does not handle the case where the input dictionary contains non-string keys or non-tuple values.  The function does not handle the case where the input dictionary contains non-numeric values for height or weight.  The function does not handle the case where the input dictionary contains a non-numeric value for the minimum height or weight.  The function does not handle the case where the minimum height or weight is negative.  The function does not handle the case where the minimum height is greater than the minimum weight.  The function does not handle the case where the minimum height or weight is not a number.  The function does not handle the case where the input dictionary is a set.  The function does not handle the case where the input dictionary is a list.  The function does not handle the case where the input dictionary is a string.  The function does not handle the case where the input dictionary is a tuple.  The function does not handle the case where the input dictionary is a boolean.  The function does not handle the case where the input dictionary is a float.  The function does not handle the case where the input dictionary is an integer.  The function does not handle the case where the input dictionary is a complex number.  The function does not handle the case where the input dictionary is a bytes-like object.  The function does not handle the case where the input dictionary is a bytearray.  The function does not handle
