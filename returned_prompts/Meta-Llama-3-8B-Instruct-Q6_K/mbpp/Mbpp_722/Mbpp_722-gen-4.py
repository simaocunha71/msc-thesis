```
def filter_data(students, min_height, min_weight):
    return {name: height_weight for name, height_weight in students.items() if height_weight[0] > min_height and height_weight[1] > min_weight}
```
The function takes in a dictionary of students, a minimum height, and a minimum weight. It then iterates over the dictionary and checks if the student's height and weight are above the minimum. If they are, the student is included in the output dictionary. The function returns this dictionary of filtered students.

The unit test provided ensures that the function works correctly. It checks that the function returns the correct dictionary when given the provided students, minimum height, and minimum weight. The expected output is a dictionary with the student 'Cierra Vega' and their height and weight, as they are the only student who meets the condition. The function passes this test, confirming that it is working as expected. 





This solution iterates over the dictionary to check each student's height and weight against the minimums. It uses the items() method to get a list-like object of a dictionary's key-value pairs, and then uses a list comprehension to filter the students that meet the condition. The function returns a new dictionary with only the students that meet the condition. This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of students.
