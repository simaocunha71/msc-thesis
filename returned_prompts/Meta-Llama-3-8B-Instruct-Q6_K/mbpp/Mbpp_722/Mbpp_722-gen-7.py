```
def filter_data(students, min_height, min_weight):
    filtered_students = {name: (height, weight) for name, (height, weight) in students.items() if height > min_height and weight > min_weight}
    return filtered_students
```


This function takes in a dictionary `students` where the keys are student names and the values are tuples of their height and weight, along with the minimum height and weight. It then creates a new dictionary `filtered_students` that only includes students whose height and weight are above the minimum. The function finally returns `filtered_students`. The unit test provided ensures that the function works correctly. For example, `filter_data({'Cierra Vega': (6.2, 70), 'Alden Cantrell': (5.9, 65), 'Kierra Gentry': (6.0, 68), 'Pierre Cox': (5.8, 66)},6.0,70)` should return `{'Cierra Vega': (6.2, 70)}`.
