def minimum(a, b):
  return min(a, b)
  # or return a if a <= b else b
  # or return min([a, b]) if you want to use the built-in min function in a more functional way
  # or return a if a < b else b if you want to use conditional statement in a more imperative way
  # etc. There are many ways to solve this problem. This is just one of them.
  # The unit test provided suggests that the function should return the smaller of the two numbers.
  # This function uses the built-in min function in Python to achieve this. It takes two arguments, a and b, 
  # and returns the smaller one. The min function works by comparing the two numbers and returning the smaller one. 
  # If you want to implement this function yourself without using the min function, you can do it like this:
  # if a <= b:
  #   return a
  # else:
  #   return b
  # This function will also return the smaller of the two numbers, but it does it manually. 
  # The min function is more concise and efficient, but this function is more explicit and easy to understand. 
  # It's up to you to decide which one you prefer. 
  # The function can be simplified even more by using the built-in min function with a list:
  # return min([a, b])
  # This function is even more concise and efficient, but it's also less explicit and easy to understand. 
  # It's up to you to decide which one you prefer. 
  # The function can be tested with the unit test provided:
  # assert minimum(1,2) == 1
  # This test will pass if the function returns 1 when given the arguments 1 and 2. 
  # If the function returns 2, the test will fail. 
  # You can run the test by calling the function with the arguments 1 and 2, like this:
  # minimum(1,2)
  # This will return 1, and the test will pass. 
  # You can also run the test in a loop, like this:
  # for i in range(100):
  #   assert minimum(i, i+1) == i
  # This will test the function with 100 different inputs, and it will pass if the function is correct. 
  # If the
