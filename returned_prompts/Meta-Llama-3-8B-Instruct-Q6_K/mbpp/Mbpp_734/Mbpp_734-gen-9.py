```
The function `sum_Of_Subarray_Prod` takes a list as input and returns the sum of products of all possible sublists of the given list. 

The function first calculates the number of elements in the list (`n`). Then, it iterates over all possible sublists of the list using two nested for loops. 

For each sublist, it calculates the product of the elements in the sublist using the built-in `sum` function. 

Finally, it returns the sum of all these products. 

The unit test `assert sum_Of_Subarray_Prod([1,2,3]) == 20` ensures that the function works correctly for the input `[1,2,3]`. 

This function has a time complexity of O(n^3) because it has three nested loops (two for loops and one sum function). This could be inefficient for large lists. 

Note: The problem statement seems to be missing a detail. It seems that the problem is asking to find the sum of products of all possible sublists of a given list, which is different from the sum of all possible sublists of a given list. If the problem is asking for the sum of all possible sublists, the solution would be different.  However, the given unit test suggests that the problem is asking for the sum of products of all possible sublists.  If this is not the correct interpretation, please clarify the problem statement. 
```python
assert sum_Of_Subarray_Prod([1,2,3]) == 20
``` 
This unit test suggests that the function should return 20 when the input is [1,2,3]. This could be because the sum of products of all possible sublists of [1,2,3] is 20. However, the problem statement does not clearly specify how the sum of products should be calculated. It could be the sum of products of all possible sublists, or it could be the sum of products of all possible subarrays. Without a clear problem statement, it is difficult to provide a correct solution. 
```python
def sum_Of_Subarray_Prod(lst):
    n = len(lst)
