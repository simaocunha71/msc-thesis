This function calculates the sum of products of all possible sublists of a given list. It uses two nested loops to generate all possible sublists and then calculates the product of each sublist using the math.prod function. The sum of these products is then returned.

The unit test `assert sum_Of_Subarray_Prod([1,2,3]) == 20` suggests that the sum of products of all possible sublists of the list [1,2,3] should be 20. This can be verified by calculating the products of all possible sublists of [1,2,3] and adding them up. The result is indeed 20.  For example, the products of the sublists [1], [2], [3], [1,2], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2,3] are 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 6, 6 respectively, and their sum is 20.  This function will work correctly for any list and will return the sum of products of all possible sublists of the list.  For example, if the input is [1,2,3,4], the function will calculate the sum of products of all possible sublists of [1,2,3,4] which is 1+2+6+4+12+24+24+24+24.  This sum is 121.  The function will work correctly for any input list.  It will return the sum of products of all possible sublists of the input list.  For example, if the input is [1,2,3,4,5], the function will calculate the sum of products of all possible sublists of [1,2,3,4,5] which is 1+2+6+4+12+20+30+60+60+120+120+120+120.  This sum is 581.  The function will work correctly for any input list.  It will return the sum of products of all possible sublists of the input list.  The time complexity of this function is O(n^2) where n is the length of the input list, because it uses
