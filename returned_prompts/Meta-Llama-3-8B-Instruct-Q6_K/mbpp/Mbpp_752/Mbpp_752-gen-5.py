The Jacobsthal sequence is a recurrence relation sequence. The nth Jacobsthal number is given by the recurrence relation T(n) = T(n-1) + 2*T(n-2) with the initial conditions T(0) = 0 and T(1) = 1. 

Here is a Python function that calculates the nth Jacobsthal number:

```
def jacobsthal_num(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        a, b = 0, 1
        for _ in range(2, n+1):
            a, b = b, a + 2*b
        return b
```

This function uses the recurrence relation to calculate the nth Jacobsthal number. It starts with the base cases T(0) = 0 and T(1) = 1, then iteratively calculates the next number in the sequence using the recurrence relation. 

The unit test `assert jacobsthal_num(5) == 11` ensures that the function is working correctly. 

The time complexity of this function is O(n), as it needs to iterate n times to calculate the nth Jacobsthal number. The space complexity is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the temporary variables a and b.

Solution 2:

The Jacobsthal sequence is a recurrence relation sequence. The nth Jacobsthal number is given by the recurrence relation T(n) = T(n-1) + 2*T(n-2) with the initial conditions T(0) = 0 and T(1) = 1. 

Here is a Python function that calculates the nth Jacobsthal number:

```
def jacobsthal_num(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return 2 * jacobsthal_num(n // 2)
    else:
        return jacobsthal_num(n - 1) + 2 * jacobsthal_num(n - 2)
```

This function uses the recurrence relation to calculate the nth Jacobsthal number. It starts with the base cases T(0) = 0 and T(1) = 1, then iteratively calculates the next number in the sequence using the recurrence relation.
