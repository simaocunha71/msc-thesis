The function `common_in_nested_lists` takes a list of lists as input, flattens it into a single list, and then finds the common elements among all the sublists. The `set` data structure is used to efficiently find the intersection of the sets.

The unit test `assert set(common_in_nested_lists([[12, 18, 23, 25, 45], [7, 12, 18, 24, 28], [1, 5, 8, 12, 15, 16, 18]]))==set([18, 12])` checks that the function returns the correct result. The `set` function is used to convert the result to a set for comparison. The `assert` statement checks that the set of common elements is equal to the expected set. If the sets are not equal, the `assert` statement raises an `AssertionError`. 

The function returns the common elements as a list. If you want to return the common elements as a set, you can remove the `list()` function call at the end of the function. 

This function assumes that the input is a list of lists, where all the sublists contain hashable elements (i.e., elements that can be used as dictionary keys). If the sublists contain unhashable elements (e.g., lists), the function will raise a `TypeError`. 

The time complexity of this function is O(n*m), where n is the number of sublists and m is the average size of the sublists. The space complexity is O(n*m), where n is the number of sublists and m is the average size of the sublists. 

The function does not modify the original input. It returns a new list containing the common elements. 

The function can be used to find the common elements in a list of lists, where the sublists contain hashable elements. 

The function can be used in situations where you need to find the common elements in a list of lists, such as when you are working with data that is stored in a list of lists, and you need to find the elements that are common to all the sublists.
