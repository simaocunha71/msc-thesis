```
def common_in_nested_lists(nested_lists):
    if not nested_lists:
        return set()
    flat_list = [item for sublist in nested_lists for item in sublist]
    common = set(flat_list[0])
    for item in flat_list[1:]:
        common &= set(item)
    return common
```    
The problem is asking to find the common elements in a list of nested lists. For example, given the nested list [[12, 18, 23, 25, 45], [7, 12, 18, 24, 28], [1, 5, 8, 12, 15, 16, 18]], the function should return [18, 12].

Here's a Python function that solves this problem:

```
def common_in_nested_lists(nested_lists):
    if not nested_lists:
        return set()
    flat_list = [item for sublist in nested_lists for item in sublist]
    common = set(flat_list[0])
    for item in flat_list[1:]:
        common &= set(item)
    return common
```

This function first checks if the input list is empty. If it is, it returns an empty set. Otherwise, it flattens the list of nested lists into a single list and initializes a set called `common` with the first element of the flat list. Then it iterates over the rest of the elements in the flat list, updating the `common` set to be the intersection of `common` and the current element. Finally, it returns the `common` set.

For example, if you call `common_in_nested_lists([[12, 18, 23, 25, 45], [7, 12, 18, 24, 28], [1, 5, 8, 12, 15, 16, 18]])`, the function will return `{18, 12}`, which are the common elements in the given nested lists. The unit test `assert set(common_in_nested_lists([[12, 18, 23, 25, 45], [7, 12, 18, 24, 28], [1, 5, 8, 12, 15, 16, 18]]))==set([18, 12])` ensures that the function works correctly.
