def count_reverse_pairs(lst):
    count = 0
    for string in lst:
        for other_string in lst:
            if string != other_string and string == other_string[::-1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```
This function iterates over each string in the list and checks if there is another string in the list that is the reverse of the current string. If such a string is found, it increments the count. The function finally returns the count. The unit test `assert count_reverse_pairs(["julia", "best", "tseb", "for", "ailuj"])== 2` ensures that the function works correctly.
