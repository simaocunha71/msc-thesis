def max_length(list_of_lists):
    return max(((len(sublist), sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists), key=lambda x: x[0])
```
The function max_length takes a list of lists as input and returns a tuple where the first element is the maximum length and the second element is the list of maximum length.

In the unit test, we have the list of lists: [[0], [1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]. The maximum length is 3 and the list of maximum length is [13, 15, 17]. The function max_length returns (3, [13, 15, 17]) as expected. 

The function uses a generator expression to create a list of tuples where each tuple contains the length of a sublist and the sublist itself. The max function is then used to find the maximum length and the corresponding list. The key argument of the max function is set to lambda x: x[0] to specify that the maximum should be found based on the first element of the tuple (i.e., the length of the sublist). The max function returns the tuple with the maximum length, which is then returned by the function max_length. 

This function works for lists of lists of any length, not just the specific example given in the unit test. It will find the maximum length and the corresponding list in the input list of lists. 

The unit test checks that the function returns the correct result for the specific example given. It does not check that the function works for other inputs, but it is designed to work for lists of lists of any length. 

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of sublists in the input list of lists. This is because the function iterates over the list of lists once to create the list of tuples, and then it iterates over this list once to find the maximum. The space complexity is also O(n), because the function creates a list of tuples that contains one tuple for each sublist in the input list of lists. 

This function is efficient and works well for large inputs. It is also easy to understand and use, and it provides the desired output for the given unit test. 

The function can be improved by adding error handling to handle cases where the input list of lists is empty or contains no sublists. In this case, the function could return a default value, such as (-1,
