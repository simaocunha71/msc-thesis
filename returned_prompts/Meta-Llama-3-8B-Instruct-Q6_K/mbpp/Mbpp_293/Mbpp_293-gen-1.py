The problem is asking to write a function that finds the third side of a right-angled triangle given two sides. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem.

The Pythagorean theorem states that a^2 + b^2 = c^2, where a and b are the lengths of the two sides that form the right angle, and c is the length of the hypotenuse (the third side).

Here's the Python function that implements this:

```
import math

def otherside_rightangle(a, b):
    return math.sqrt(a**2 + b**2)
```

This function takes two arguments, a and b, which are the lengths of the two sides that form the right angle. It then returns the length of the hypotenuse, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of a and b.

For example, if we call the function with arguments 7 and 8, it returns the length of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with one side of length 7 and the other side of length 8. This is equal to 10.63014581273465, as shown in the unit test.

The unit test is:

```
assert otherside_rightangle(7,8)==10.63014581273465
```

This test checks if the function returns the correct length of the hypotenuse for a right-angled triangle with one side of length 7 and the other side of length 8. If the function returns the correct value, the test passes. Otherwise, it fails and an error message is displayed.```python
import math

def otherside_rightangle(a, b):
    return math.sqrt(a**2 + b**2)

assert otherside_rightangle(7,8)==10.63014581273465
```


This function is accurate and reliable, and it can be used to find the length of the hypotenuse of any right-angled triangle. It's a useful tool for anyone who needs to solve problems involving right-angled triangles.
