You are trying to find the length of the third side of a right-angled triangle given the lengths of the other two sides. This is known as the Pythagorean theorem. The formula for this is:

c = âˆš(a^2 + b^2)

where 'c' is the length of the third side, 'a' and 'b' are the lengths of the other two sides.

The unit test provided is:
assert otherside_rightangle(7,8)==10.63014581273465

This test is checking if the function 'otherside_rightangle' returns the correct value for a right-angled triangle with sides of 7 and 8 units.

Here is the solution:
```
import math

def otherside_rightangle(a, b):
    return math.sqrt(a**2 + b**2)
``` """
"""
This function takes two arguments, 'a' and 'b', which are the lengths of the two sides of a right-angled triangle. It uses the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the length of the third side, 'c'. The result is returned as a float value.
