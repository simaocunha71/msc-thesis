```
def even_Power_Sum(n):
    total = 0
    for i in range(2, n*2, 2):
        total += i**5
    return total
```


The problem is asking to create a function that calculates the sum of the first n even natural numbers raised to the fifth power. 

The given unit test `assert even_Power_Sum(2) == 1056` helps in understanding the problem better. It implies that the function should calculate the sum of the first 2 even natural numbers (2, 4) raised to the fifth power, which is 2^5 + 4^5 = 32 + 1024 = 1056.

Here is the Python function that solves the problem:

```
def even_Power_Sum(n):
    total = 0
    for i in range(2, n*2, 2):
        total += i**5
    return total
```

This function initializes a variable `total` to 0, then enters a for loop that starts from 2 (the first even natural number), and increments by 2 in each iteration. The loop continues until it reaches `n*2`, which is the `n`-th even natural number. In each iteration, the current even natural number is raised to the fifth power and added to `total`. Finally, the function returns the calculated `total`.
