```


The function `even_Power_Sum` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of the first `n` even natural numbers raised to the fifth power. 

The function uses a list comprehension to generate the even numbers from 2 to `n*2` (since the last even number is `n*2`), squares them to the fifth power, and then sums them up using the built-in `sum` function. 

For example, when `n=2`, the function returns the sum of the first 2 even natural numbers raised to the fifth power, which is `2^5 + 4^5 = 32 + 1024 = 1056`. 

The unit test `assert even_Power_Sum(2) == 1056` confirms that the function works correctly for `n=2`. 

The function can handle any positive integer `n` as input, and the time complexity is O(n).  The space complexity is O(n) due to the list comprehension.  However, the actual memory usage is constant because the list comprehension generates a list of size `n`, which is a constant factor.  Therefore, the space complexity is effectively constant.  The function is efficient and can handle large values of `n`.
