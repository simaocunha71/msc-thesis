This function takes a list of words as an input and returns a tuple of two words that start with the letter 'p'. The function iterates over each word in the list, checks if the word starts with 'p', and if it does, it adds the word to the result list. Finally, it returns the result list as a tuple. The unit test checks if the function returns the correct result for the given input. The function is then called with the input and the output is printed.
