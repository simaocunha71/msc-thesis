You can use the built-in `list` function in Python to split a string into characters. Here's a simple function that does that:

```python
def split(s):
    return list(s)
```

This function works by passing the string `s` to the `list` function, which returns a list of characters in the string. For example, if you call `split('python')`, it will return `['p', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n']`. The unit test `assert split('python') == ['p','y','t','h','o','n']` will pass for this function. 

Note that the `list` function is used to convert the string into a list of characters. This is a common way to split a string into characters in Python. 

Also, this function does not remove any characters or modify the string in any way. It simply converts the string into a list of characters. If you want to split the string into characters based on some condition (like splitting a string into words), you would need a different function. 

For example, if you want to split a string into words, you could use the `split` function with a space character as the separator:

```python
def split_words(s):
    return s.split()
```

This function will split the string `s` into words and return them as a list. For example, if you call `split_words('hello world')`, it will return `['hello', 'world']`. 

Remember that the `split` function with no arguments will split the string into words based on whitespace. If you want to split the string based on a different separator, you can pass that separator as an argument to the `split` function. For example, if you want to split the string based on commas, you could use `s.split(',')`. 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions. 

Also, this solution is correct because the problem statement does not mention anything about removing any characters. It simply asks to split the string into characters. The unit test provided also suggests that the function should return a list of characters. So, the solution is correct according to the problem statement and the unit test. 

However, if the problem statement was asking for something else, like splitting the string into words or removing certain characters, then the solution would be different. But based on the problem statement and the unit test, the solution provided is correct. 

I hope
