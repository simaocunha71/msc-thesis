You can use the list function to split a string into characters. Here's how you can do it:

```Python
def split(s):
    return list(s)
```

This function takes a string `s` as input and returns a list of characters. For example, `split('python')` will return `['p', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n']`. 

This function works by using the built-in `list` function, which converts a string into a list of characters. The `list` function splits the string into individual characters and returns them as a list. 

For example, if you call `split('python')`, the `list` function will split the string 'python' into individual characters, resulting in the list `['p', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n']`. 

The `assert` statement in the problem description is a test to ensure that the function is working correctly. It checks that the output of `split('python')` is indeed `['p', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n']`. If the function is working correctly, the `assert` statement will not raise an error. If the function is not working correctly, the `assert` statement will raise an error. 

The unit test `assert split('python') == ['p','y','t','h','o','n']` is used to verify that the function is working correctly. If the function is working correctly, the assertion will pass. If the function is not working correctly, the assertion will fail. 

The `assert` statement is a way to verify that the function is working correctly. It is a way to test the function and ensure that it is producing the expected output. 

The `assert` statement is used to check that the output of the function is equal to the expected output. If the output is not equal to the expected output, the `assert` statement will raise an error. If the output is equal to the expected output, the `assert` statement will not raise an error. 

In this case, the expected output is `['p', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n']`. The `assert` statement is checking that the output of the `split` function is equal to this expected output. If the output is not equal to the expected output, the `assert` statement will raise an error. If the output is equal to the
