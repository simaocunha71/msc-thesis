```
def add_pairwise(t):
    return tuple(a + b for a, b in zip(t, t[1:]))
```


This function uses the built-in zip function to pair up the elements of the tuple with their neighbors. The zip function returns an iterator of tuples, where the i-th tuple contains the i-th element from each of the argument sequences or iterables. 

For example, if the tuple is (1, 5, 7, 8, 10), zip(t, t[1:]) will return an iterator that generates the following tuples: ((1, 5), (5, 7), (7, 8), (8, 10)). 

The function then uses a generator expression to add the elements of each pair, and finally converts the result to a tuple using the tuple function. 

This function will pass the given unit test. The unit test checks if the function returns the correct result for the tuple (1, 5, 7, 8, 10), which is (6, 12, 15, 18). 

For example, the first element of the result is the sum of the first and second elements of the tuple, which is 1 + 5 = 6. The second element of the result is the sum of the second and third elements of the tuple, which is 5 + 7 = 12, and so on. 

The function works for tuples of any length, not just the one given in the unit test. It will correctly add the neighboring elements of any tuple.
