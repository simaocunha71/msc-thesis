```
def add_pairwise(t):
    return tuple(t[i] + t[i + 1] for i in range(len(t) - 1))
```



The problem is asking you to write a function that takes a tuple of numbers as input and returns a new tuple where each element is the sum of the corresponding elements in the input tuple.

The input tuple is assumed to have at least two elements. The function adds the first and second elements, then the second and third elements, and so on, until it reaches the second to last and last elements.

For example, if the input tuple is (1, 5, 7, 8, 10), the function should return (6, 12, 15, 18). This is because 1 + 5 = 6, 5 + 7 = 12, 7 + 8 = 15, and 8 + 10 = 18.

Here is a Python function that solves this problem:

```
def add_pairwise(t):
    return tuple(t[i] + t[i + 1] for i in range(len(t) - 1))
```

This function uses a generator expression to iterate over the input tuple and add each element to the next one. The `range(len(t) - 1)` part ensures that we don't go out of bounds when trying to access the next element. The `tuple` function is used to convert the generator expression into a tuple.
