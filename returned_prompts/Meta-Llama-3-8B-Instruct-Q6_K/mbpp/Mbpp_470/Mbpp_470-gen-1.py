def add_pairwise(t):
    return tuple(x + y for x, y in zip(t, t[1:]))
```


The unit test `assert add_pairwise((1, 5, 7, 8, 10)) == (6, 12, 15, 18)` helps in understanding the requirement of the problem. It is asking to add the neighboring elements of the given tuple. This can be achieved by using the built-in `zip` function in Python, which pairs the elements of the tuple with their next elements. The `tuple` function is then used to convert the result into a tuple. 

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
def add_pairwise(t):
    return tuple(x + y for x, y in zip(t, t[1:]))
```

This function takes a tuple `t` as input and returns a new tuple where each element is the sum of the corresponding elements in the input tuple and the next element in the tuple. The `zip` function is used to pair the elements of the tuple with their next elements, and the `tuple` function is used to convert the result into a tuple. The `t[1:]` is used to get all elements of the tuple except the first one, which is used as the next element for each element in the tuple. 

For example, if the input tuple is `(1, 5, 7, 8, 10)`, the function will return `(6, 12, 15, 18)`, which is the sum of the neighboring elements in the input tuple. 

The function works for tuples of any length, not just the one shown in the unit test. It also works for tuples of any type, not just integers. The function assumes that the input is a tuple and returns a tuple as the result. If the input is not a tuple, the function will raise an error. 

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input tuple, because it needs to iterate over the entire tuple once to calculate the pairwise sums. The space complexity is also O(n), because it needs to store the result in a tuple of the same length as the input tuple. 





This solution passes the given unit test:

```
assert add_pairwise((1, 5, 7, 8, 10)) == (6, 12, 15, 18)
```
