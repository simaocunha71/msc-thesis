The problem is asking you to create a function that determines whether a given integer is a prime number or not. 

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. 

The provided unit test `assert prime_num(13)==True` suggests that the function should return `True` for the input `13`, which is a prime number. 

Here is a Python solution for the problem:

The function `prime_num` takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if it is a prime number, and `False` otherwise. 

First, it checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1, in which case it is not a prime number. 

Then, it checks if `n` is 2, which is the only even prime number. 

If `n` is greater than 2, it checks if `n` is divisible by any odd number up to the square root of `n`. If it is, then `n` is not a prime number. 

If `n` is not divisible by any of these numbers, then it is a prime number, and the function returns `True`. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(sqrt(n)), which is efficient for large inputs. 





This is a Python solution for the problem. It uses a loop to check if the number is divisible by any number up to its square root. If it is, then it is not a prime number. If it is not divisible by any of these numbers, then it is a prime number.
