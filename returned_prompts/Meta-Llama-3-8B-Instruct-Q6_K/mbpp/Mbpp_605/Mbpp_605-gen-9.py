The function `prime_num(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if it is a prime number, and `False` otherwise. 

The function first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1, in which case it is not a prime number and the function returns `False`. 

Then it iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive), and checks if `n` is divisible by any of these numbers. If it is, then `n` is not a prime number and the function returns `False`. 

If `n` is not divisible by any of these numbers, then it is a prime number and the function returns `True`. 

For example, the unit test `assert prime_num(13)==True` indicates that the function should return `True` for the input `13`, which is a prime number.  This unit test ensures that the function works correctly for prime numbers. 

The time complexity of this function is O(sqrt(n)), which is efficient for large inputs.  The space complexity is O(1), which means the function uses a constant amount of space.  This is efficient for large inputs. 

This function also handles the case where `n` is 2, which is a prime number.  The function returns `True` for `n=2`, as expected.  This is because the function correctly identifies 2 as a prime number. 

The function also handles the case where `n` is greater than 1 but not a prime number.  For example, if `n=4`, the function returns `False`, as expected.  This is because the function correctly identifies 4 as not a prime number. 

Overall, the function is efficient, correct, and handles edge cases correctly.  It is suitable for use in a real-world application.  The unit test `assert prime_num(13)==True` ensures that the function works correctly for prime numbers.  The function can be used to check if a given integer is a prime number.  For example, `prime_num(13)` returns `True`, indicating that 13 is a prime number.  Similarly, `prime_num(4)` returns
