```
def armstrong_number(n):
    num_str = str(n)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in num_str:
        sum += int(digit)**num_len
    return sum == n
```    



Explanation:
The function armstrong_number checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of the cubes of its digits. For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153.

The function converts the given number into a string to easily iterate over its digits. It then calculates the sum of the cubes of its digits. If the sum is equal to the original number, the function returns True, indicating that the number is an Armstrong number. Otherwise, it returns False.

The unit test `assert armstrong_number(153)==True` ensures that the function correctly identifies 153 as an Armstrong number.   



Note: This solution assumes that the input number is a positive integer. If you want to handle negative numbers or non-integer inputs, you'll need to add additional logic.    



Also, this solution uses a simple iterative approach. If you're interested in a more efficient solution using recursion, you can modify the function to use recursion instead of iteration. However, the basic idea remains the same.   



Lastly, this solution assumes that the input number is a single-digit number. If you want to handle multi-digit numbers, you can modify the function to use the length of the number as the exponent for the cube operation.   



Overall, this solution is a straightforward and efficient way to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number.    



It's worth noting that this solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of digits in the input number. This is because the function iterates over each digit in the number to calculate the sum of the cubes. The space complexity is O(1), which means the function uses a constant amount of space, regardless of the size of the input number.   



I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
