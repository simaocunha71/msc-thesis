```
def armstrong_number(n):
    str_n = str(n)
    length = len(str_n)
    sum = 0
    for digit in str_n:
        sum += int(digit) ** length
    return sum == n
```



Explanation:
The problem is asking to create a function that checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of the cubes of its digits.

The function takes an integer `n` as input, converts it into a string `str_n` to easily access each digit, calculates the sum of the cubes of each digit raised to the power of the length of the number, and checks if the sum is equal to the original number. If it is, the function returns `True`, indicating that the number is an Armstrong number. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The unit test `assert armstrong_number(153)==True` helps to clarify the problem by providing a specific example of an Armstrong number. The test expects the function to return `True` when given the input `153`, which is indeed an Armstrong number (1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153). This test helps to ensure that the function is working correctly.
