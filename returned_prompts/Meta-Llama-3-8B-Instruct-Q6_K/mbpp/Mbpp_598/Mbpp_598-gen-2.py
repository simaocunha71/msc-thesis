Explanation:
The problem is asking to create a function that checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of cubes of its digits.

The provided unit test `assert armstrong_number(153)==True` helps to understand the problem better, as it indicates that 153 is an Armstrong number.

The solution is a Python function named `armstrong_number` that takes an integer `n` as input. It converts the number to a string, initializes a variable `sum` to 0, and then iterates over each character (digit) in the string. For each digit, it calculates the cube of the digit and adds it to `sum`. Finally, it checks if `sum` is equal to the original number `n`. If it is, the function returns `True`, indicating that the number is an Armstrong number. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This solution uses the `str` function to convert the number to a string, the `int` function to convert each character to an integer, and the `**` operator to calculate the cube of a number. The `len` function is used to get the number of digits in the number. The `assert` statement is used to test the function with the input 153.  



Note: The problem statement does not explicitly mention the range of the input number, but based on the unit test, it can be assumed that the input number can be any positive integer.  



Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of digits in the input number. This is because the function iterates over each digit in the number.  



Space complexity: O(1), as the function only uses a constant amount of space to store the sum and the number of digits.  



The function can be optimized by using a more efficient method to calculate the sum of the cubes of the digits, such as using the `math.pow` function or a list comprehension. However, the provided solution is straightforward and easy to understand.  



It's worth noting that the problem statement does not specify the range of the input number, but based on the unit test, it can be assumed that the input number can be any positive integer. If the input number is negative or zero,
