def armstrong_number(n):
    num_digits = len(str(n))
    sum = 0
    temp = n
    while temp > 0:
        digit = temp % 10
        sum += digit ** num_digits
        temp //= 10
    return sum == n
```        
This function checks whether the given number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of the cubes of its digits. For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153. The function converts the number to a string to get the number of digits, then iterates over the digits, cubing each one and adding it to a running total. If the total is equal to the original number, the function returns True, indicating that the number is an Armstrong number; otherwise, it returns False.
The unit test `assert armstrong_number(153)==True` ensures that the function correctly identifies 153 as an Armstrong number.        
```python
assert armstrong_number(153)==True
```        
The unit test is checking if the output of `armstrong_number(153)` is `True`, which is expected because 153 is indeed an Armstrong number. If the function is correct, the test should pass. If the function is incorrect, the test will fail, indicating that there is a bug in the function.        
```python
import unittest

class TestArmstrongNumber(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_armstrong_number(self):
        self.assertTrue(armstrong_number(153))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```        
This is an example of how you can use the `unittest` module to write unit tests for your function. The `TestArmstrongNumber` class contains a single test method, `test_armstrong_number`, which calls the `armstrong_number` function with the argument `153` and checks that the result is `True`. If the function is correct, the test will pass; if the function is incorrect, the test will fail.        
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```        
This line of code runs the unit tests. When you run the script, it will execute the tests and report any failures. If all tests pass, it will report that all tests passed.        
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```        
This line of code runs the unit tests.
