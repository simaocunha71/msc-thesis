```
def sum_even_and_even_index(lst):
    return sum(num for i, num in enumerate(lst) if i % 2 == 0 and num % 2 == 0)
```
The function `sum_even_and_even_index` takes a list `lst` as input. It uses the `enumerate` function to iterate over the list with both the index `i` and the value `num`. It checks if the index `i` is even (i.e., `i % 2 == 0`) and if the value `num` is even (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`). If both conditions are met, it adds the value `num` to the sum. Finally, it returns the sum of even numbers at even positions. The unit test `assert sum_even_and_even_index([5, 6, 12, 1, 18, 8]) == 30` ensures that the function works correctly. 

For example, in the list `[5, 6, 12, 1, 18, 8]`, the even positions are 0 and 2, and the even numbers at these positions are 6 and 12. The sum of these numbers is 18. However, the problem statement asks for the sum of even numbers at even positions, which means the sum should be 18, not 30. The unit test is incorrect. The correct unit test should be `assert sum_even_and_even_index([5, 6, 12, 1, 18, 8]) == 18`.
