        return True
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):

The function takes an integer `n` and checks if it is not a prime number. It returns `True` if the number is not prime and `False` if it is prime.

The function first checks if the number is less than or equal to 1. If it is, the function returns `True` because numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime.

Then, the function iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive) and checks if `n` is divisible by any of these numbers. If `n` is divisible, the function returns `True` because `n` is not prime.

If the function does not find any divisors, it returns `False` because `n` is prime.

The unit test `assert is_not_prime(2) == False` ensures that the function correctly identifies prime numbers. Since 2 is a prime number, the function should return `False` for this input.
