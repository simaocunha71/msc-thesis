This function checks if a number is not prime by checking for divisibility. If the number is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of the number, it's not prime. 

The unit test `assert is_not_prime(2) == False` ensures that the function correctly identifies 2 as a prime number. Since the function returns `False` for 2, it means that the function correctly identifies prime numbers. 

Note that this function only checks if a number is not prime, it doesn't check if a number is prime. If you want to check if a number is prime, you can simply return the opposite of the result, i.e., `return not is_not_prime(n)`. 

Also, this function has a time complexity of O(sqrt(n)), which is efficient for large numbers. However, it's not the most efficient algorithm for large numbers, especially for numbers that are not prime. For such cases, you may want to use a more advanced algorithm like the Miller-Rabin primality test. 

Finally, this function assumes that the input is a positive integer. If the input can be negative or a non-integer, you may want to add error handling to handle such cases.  ```python

```python
def is_not_prime(n):
    if type(n) != int or n <= 1:
        raise ValueError("Input must be a positive integer")
    if n <= 1:
        return True
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
``` 
This version of the function raises a ValueError if the input is not a positive integer. You can modify the error handling to suit your specific needs.  ```python

```python
def is_not_prime(n):
    if type(n) != int or n <= 1:
        raise ValueError("Input must be a positive integer")
    if n <= 1:
        return True
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
