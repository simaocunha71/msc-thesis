This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is not a prime number, and `False` otherwise.

The function first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1, in which case it is not a prime number. Then, it iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive) to check if `n` is divisible by any of these numbers. If it is, then `n` is not a prime number, and the function returns `True`. If `n` is not divisible by any of these numbers, then it is a prime number, and the function returns `False`.

The unit test `assert is_not_prime(2) == False` ensures that the function correctly identifies prime numbers as well as non-prime numbers. In this case, the function returns `False` because 2 is a prime number.
