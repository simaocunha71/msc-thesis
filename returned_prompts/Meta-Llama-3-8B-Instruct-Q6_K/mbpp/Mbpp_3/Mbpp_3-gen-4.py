The function checks if a number is not prime by iterating from 5 to the square root of the number and checking if the number is divisible by any of these numbers. If it is, then the number is not prime and the function returns True. If the number is not divisible by any of these numbers, then it is prime and the function returns False.

The unit test `assert is_not_prime(2) == False` ensures that the function correctly identifies prime numbers. The test case checks if the function returns False for the prime number 2, which is the correct result. 

Note that the function also returns False for 2 and 3, which are the smallest prime numbers, and returns True for 1, which is not a prime number. This is according to the definition of a prime number, where a prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. 

The function also returns True for numbers that are less than or equal to 1, which is correct according to the definition of a prime number. 

The function is not case sensitive and correctly identifies non-prime numbers. For example, it correctly identifies 6 as a non-prime number because it is divisible by 2 and 3. 

The function is efficient and has a time complexity of O(sqrt(n)), where n is the input number. This is because the function only needs to iterate up to the square root of the number to check if it is prime. 

The function also correctly identifies prime numbers, such as 5 and 7, by returning False for these numbers. 

The function is easy to understand and use, and it provides a clear and concise way to identify non-prime numbers in Python.
