The task is to write a function in Python that identifies non-prime numbers. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. 

However, the problem statement does not clearly define what "non-prime numbers" are. But, based on the unit test `assert is_not_prime(2) == False`, it can be inferred that the function should return `False` for prime numbers and `True` for non-prime numbers.

Here is a Python function that fulfills this requirement:

```Python
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return True
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This function works by checking if a given number `n` is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not a prime number and the function returns `True`. If `n` is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is a prime number and the function returns `False`. 

Note that the function returns `True` for `n <= 1` because these numbers are not considered prime in mathematics. The unit test `assert is_not_prime(2) == False` is also fulfilled because the function returns `False` for prime numbers.
