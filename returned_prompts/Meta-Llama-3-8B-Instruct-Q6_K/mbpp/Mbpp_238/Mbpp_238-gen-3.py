The problem is asking to write a function that counts the number of non-empty substrings of a given string. For example, if the input string is "abc", the function should return 6 because there are 6 non-empty substrings: "a", "ab", "abc", "b", "bc", and "c".

Here is a Python function that solves the problem:

```
def number_of_substrings(s):
    return len(s) * (len(s) + 1) // 2
```

This function works by using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to calculate the number of non-empty substrings. The formula is `n * (n + 1) / 2`, where `n` is the length of the string. This formula works because each character in the string can be the start of a substring, and each pair of characters can also be the start of a substring, and so on.

For example, if the input string is "abc", the function will return `3 * (3 + 1) // 2 = 6`, which is the correct number of non-empty substrings.

The unit test `assert number_of_substrings("abc") == 6` ensures that the function works correctly for the input "abc". If the function returns the correct number of non-empty substrings for this input, the unit test will pass. If the function returns an incorrect number, the unit test will fail. This helps to ensure that the function works correctly for all inputs.
