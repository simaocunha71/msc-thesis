def cube_Sum(n):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(2, n*2, 2):
        sum += i**3
    return sum
```


This problem is asking to find the sum of the cubes of the first n even natural numbers. For example, if n is 2, the even natural numbers are 2 and 4, and their cubes are 8 and 64, so the sum of their cubes is 8 + 64 = 72. 

The provided unit test `assert cube_Sum(2) == 72` helps to understand the problem better. 

The function `cube_Sum` uses a loop to iterate from 2 to 2*n (since the even natural numbers are from 2 to 2*n), incrementing by 2 each time. For each number, it calculates the cube and adds it to the sum. Finally, it returns the sum. 

For example, if you call `cube_Sum(2)`, it will calculate the sum of the cubes of the first 2 even natural numbers, which is 72. 

This function assumes that n is a positive integer. If n is not a positive integer, the function may not work correctly.  You may want to add error checking code to handle this case. 

Also, the function does not handle the case where n is zero. You may want to add a special case to handle this.  For example, you could return 0 when n is 0.  Here is how you could modify the function to add this special case:

```
def cube_Sum(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    sum = 0
    for i in range(2, n*2, 2):
        sum += i**3
    return sum
```  This modified function will return 0 when n is 0 or negative, and it will calculate the sum of the cubes of the first n even natural numbers when n is positive.  It will also work correctly when n is 1, since the sum of the cubes of the first 1 even natural number is 0.  You can test it with different values of n to see that it works correctly.  For example, `cube_Sum(1)` will return 0, `cube_Sum(2)` will return 72, and `cube_Sum(3)` will return 288.  You can use
