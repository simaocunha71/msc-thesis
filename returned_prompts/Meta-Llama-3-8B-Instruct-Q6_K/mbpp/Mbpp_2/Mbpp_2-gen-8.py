```
def similar_elements(list1, list2):
    return set(list1) & set(list2)
```
The problem is asking to find the common elements between two lists. The provided unit test suggests that the input is a tuple of lists, but the function should still work with the standard list input.

The solution is to convert the lists into sets and then find the intersection of the two sets using the & operator. This will give us the common elements between the two lists.

Here's the explanation of the unit test:
```
assert set(similar_elements((3, 4, 5, 6),(5, 7, 4, 10))) == set((4, 5))
```
This test is checking if the function `similar_elements` returns the correct common elements between the two lists `(3, 4, 5, 6)` and `(5, 7, 4, 10)`. The expected output is `set((4, 5))`, which means the function should return a set containing the elements `4` and `5` that are common to both lists. The `assert` statement will pass if the function returns the correct result. If the function returns an incorrect result, the `assert` statement will raise an `AssertionError`.
