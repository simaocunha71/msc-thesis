```
def similar_elements(list1, list2):
    return set(list1) & set(list2)
```


The function `similar_elements` takes two lists `list1` and `list2` as input and returns a set of elements that are common to both lists. The `&` operator is used to find the intersection of the two sets. This means it returns a set containing elements that are present in both `list1` and `list2`. The unit test `assert set(similar_elements((3, 4, 5, 6),(5, 7, 4, 10))) == set((4, 5))` demonstrates that the function works as expected. It checks that the function returns a set containing the elements `4` and `5` when given the lists `(3, 4, 5, 6)` and `(5, 7, 4, 10)` as input. 
```
python
similar_elements((3, 4, 5, 6),(5, 7, 4, 10))
````
This function works by first converting the input lists into sets. This is because the `&` operator works on sets, not lists. The `set` function is used to convert the lists into sets. The `&` operator is then used to find the intersection of the two sets, which is the set of elements that are present in both lists. This result is then returned by the function. 
```
python
set(list1) & set(list2)
````
The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the total number of elements in the input lists. This is because the `set` function has a time complexity of O(n) and the `&` operator also has a time complexity of O(n) when the input sets are of size n. The space complexity is also O(n), as the function creates two sets of size n.

def similar_elements(list1, list2):
    return set(list1) & set(list2)
```
This function is efficient and works well for large input lists. It is also easy to understand and implement. 
```
python
assert set(similar_elements((3, 4, 5, 6),(5, 7, 4, 10))) == set((4, 5))
