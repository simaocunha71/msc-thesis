```
def similar_elements(list1, list2):
    return set(element for element in list1 if element in list2)
```
The problem is asking to write a function that takes two lists as input and returns the elements that are common to both lists. 

The unit test `assert set(similar_elements((3, 4, 5, 6),(5, 7, 4, 10))) == set((4, 5))` suggests that the function should return a set of elements that are present in both lists.

Here is a Python function that solves the problem. It uses a set comprehension to create a set of elements from the first list that are also present in the second list. The `in` operator is used to check if an element is present in the second list.

The function is case-sensitive and does not preserve the order of elements. If you need to preserve the order or make the function case-insensitive, you can modify it accordingly. 

For example, if you want to make the function case-insensitive, you can convert both lists to sets and then use the `&` operator to find the intersection of the two sets. Here is an example:
```
def similar_elements(list1, list2):
    set1 = set(element for element in list1)
    set2 = set(element for element in list2)
    return set1 & set2
```
