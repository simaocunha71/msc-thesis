def similar_elements(list1, list2):
    return set(list1) & set(list2)
```
The function takes two lists as input, converts them into sets, and then finds the intersection of the two sets using the `&` operator. The resulting set contains the common elements between the two lists. This function is case-sensitive and considers duplicates as well. For example, if the input lists are `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and `[4, 5, 6, 7]`, the output will be `{4}`. The order of elements in the output set is not guaranteed to be the same as the order in the input lists. 

In the unit test `assert set(similar_elements((3, 4, 5, 6),(5, 7, 4, 10))) == set((4, 5))`, the function correctly identifies the shared elements `4` and `5` from the input lists `(3, 4, 5, 6)` and `(5, 7, 4, 10)`. 

This function assumes that the input lists are non-empty. If the input lists are empty, the function will return an empty set. If the input lists are not lists, the function will raise a TypeError. 

For example, if the input is `similar_elements(1, 2)`, the function will raise a TypeError because `1` and `2` are not lists. 

The function does not modify the input lists. It returns a new set containing the shared elements. 

The function is efficient because it uses the built-in set operations, which have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input lists. 
```python
def similar_elements(list1, list2):
    return set(list1) & set(list2)
```  ```
```python
assert set(similar_elements((3, 4, 5, 6),(5, 7, 4, 10))) == set((4, 5))
```  ```
```python
similar_elements([1, 2, 3, 4], [4, 5, 6, 7])  # returns {4}
```  ```
```python
similar_elements([], [1, 2, 3, 4])  # returns set()
```  ```
```python
similar_elements('hello', [1, 2, 3, 4
