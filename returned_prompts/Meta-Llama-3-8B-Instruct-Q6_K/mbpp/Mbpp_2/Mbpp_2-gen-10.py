```
def similar_elements(list1, list2):
    return set(element for element in list1 if element in list2)
```



Explanation:
The problem is asking to find the common elements between two lists. The function should return a set of elements that are present in both lists.

The given unit test `assert set(similar_elements((3, 4, 5, 6),(5, 7, 4, 10))) == set((4, 5))` helps to understand the problem better. It means that the function should return the set `(4, 5)` when the input lists are `(3, 4, 5, 6)` and `(5, 7, 4, 10)`.

The solution is a simple set comprehension that iterates over the first list and checks if each element is present in the second list. If an element is found in the second list, it is added to the set. The function returns this set of common elements.

Note: The order of elements in the set is not important, and the function will return a set of unique elements, even if the input lists contain duplicate elements. This is because sets automatically eliminate duplicates. If you need the elements to be in the same order as they appear in the lists, you would need to use a different data structure, such as a list or a tuple.
