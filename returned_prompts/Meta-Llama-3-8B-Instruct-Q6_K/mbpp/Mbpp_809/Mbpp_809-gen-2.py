```
def check_smaller(t1, t2):
    return all(i <= j for i, j in zip(t1, t2))
```





This function uses the built-in `zip` function to iterate over the two tuples in parallel. The `all` function then checks if all elements in the resulting iterator are True. If any element is False (which means the corresponding elements in the tuples are not in the correct order), the function will immediately return False. If the function finishes iterating over the tuples without finding any incorrect order, it will return True. This allows us to check if each element of the second tuple is smaller than its corresponding element in the first tuple.

The unit test provided, `assert check_smaller((1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 4)) == False`, ensures that this function works correctly by checking that it returns False for a pair of tuples where the elements in the second tuple are not smaller than those in the first tuple.
