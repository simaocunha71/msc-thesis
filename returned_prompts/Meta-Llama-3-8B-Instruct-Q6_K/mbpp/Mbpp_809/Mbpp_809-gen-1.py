```
def check_smaller(t1, t2):
    for i in range(len(t1)):
        if t1[i] <= t2[i]:
            return False
    return True
```


This function takes two tuples `t1` and `t2` as input, and returns `True` if each element of `t2` is smaller than its corresponding element in `t1`, and `False` otherwise. The function iterates over the indices of `t1` using a for loop, and for each index, it checks if the corresponding element in `t2` is smaller than the element in `t1`. If it finds an index where this condition is not met, it immediately returns `False`. If it checks all indices and finds that each element in `t2` is smaller than its corresponding element in `t1`, it returns `True`. The unit test `assert check_smaller((1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 4)) == False` ensures that the function behaves correctly. 





The code above is a solution to the problem. It defines a function `check_smaller` that takes two tuples `t1` and `t2` as input and returns `True` if each element of `t2` is smaller than its corresponding element in `t1`, and `False` otherwise.

The function uses a for loop to iterate over the indices of `t1`. For each index, it checks if the corresponding element in `t2` is smaller than the element in `t1`. If it finds an index where this condition is not met, it immediately returns `False`.

If the function checks all indices and finds that each element in `t2` is smaller than its corresponding element in `t1`, it returns `True`. This is ensured by the unit test `assert check_smaller((1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 4)) == False`, which checks that the function returns `False` when the condition is not met.
