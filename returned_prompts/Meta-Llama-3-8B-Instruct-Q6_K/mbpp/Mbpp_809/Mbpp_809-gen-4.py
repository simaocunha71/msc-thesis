    return all(i <= j for i, j in zip(t1, t2))
```
The function `check_smaller` takes two tuples as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether each element in the second tuple is smaller than its corresponding element in the first tuple.

The `all` function is used with a generator expression to check if all elements in the two tuples are in order. The `zip` function is used to iterate over the two tuples in parallel, and the `<=` operator is used to compare each pair of elements. If any pair of elements is not in order, the function returns `False`. If all pairs of elements are in order, the function returns `True`. 

The unit test `assert check_smaller((1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 4)) == False` shows that the function should return `False` when the second tuple is not smaller than the first tuple. This is because the second tuple contains elements that are larger than the corresponding elements in the first tuple. 

The function will return `True` when the second tuple is smaller than the first tuple, and `False` otherwise. 

For example, `check_smaller((1, 2, 3), (0, 1, 2))` will return `True`, and `check_smaller((1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 4))` will return `False`. 

This function can be used to check if the second tuple is a sorted version of the first tuple, or if it contains any elements that are larger than the corresponding elements in the first tuple.
