def count_charac(s):
    return len(s)
```
This function uses the built-in `len()` function in Python, which returns the number of items in an object. In this case, it returns the number of characters in the string `s`. The unit test `assert count_charac("python programming")==18` ensures that the function works correctly, as the string "python programming" has 18 characters.  The function does not actually count characters, it simply returns the length of the string.  This is why it is called `count_charac` rather than `count_characters`.  It does not actually count the characters, it just returns the count.  The name `count_charac` is a bit misleading, and a more accurate name would be `count_string_length`.  However, the name `count_charac` is used in the unit test, so it is used here as well.  This is a good example of how the name of a function should reflect its purpose.  In this case, the name of the function does not accurately reflect its purpose.  It would be better to name it `count_string_length` or something similar.  This would make it clear what the function does, and would be more accurate.  However, the name `count_charac` is used in the unit test, so it is used here as well.
