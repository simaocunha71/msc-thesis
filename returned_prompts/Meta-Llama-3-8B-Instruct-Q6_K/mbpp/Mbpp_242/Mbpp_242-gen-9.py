```
def count_charac(s):
    return len(s)
```





Python's built-in `len()` function returns the length of a string, which is the number of characters in the string. So, we can use this function to count the total number of characters in a string. The unit test `assert count_charac("python programming")==18` also confirms this, as the string "python programming" contains 18 characters. Therefore, the function `count_charac(s)` can be implemented as `return len(s)`.  This solution is efficient and easy to understand.
