    for char in s:
        if char == '0':
            zeros += 1
        else:
            ones += 1

The problem asks to find the maximum difference between the number of 0s and number of 1s in any sub-string of the given binary string. The function `find_length` iterates over the binary string, keeping track of the current difference between the number of 0s and 1s. It updates the maximum difference whenever the current difference is greater. The function returns the maximum difference found. 

The unit test `assert find_length("11000010001") == 6` ensures that the function works correctly. It checks that the maximum difference for the binary string "11000010001" is 6, which is the correct answer. 

The time complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the length of the binary string, because it needs to iterate over the string once. The space complexity is O(1), because it uses a constant amount of space to store the counts of 0s and 1s, and the maximum difference.
