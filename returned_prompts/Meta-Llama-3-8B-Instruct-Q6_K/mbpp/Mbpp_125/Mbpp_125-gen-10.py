The function `find_length` takes a binary string `s` as input and returns the maximum difference between the number of 0s and number of 1s in any sub-string of `s`. It iterates over the string and calculates the difference between the number of 0s and number of 1s for each prefix of the string. It keeps track of the maximum difference and the corresponding number of 0s and 1s. Finally, it returns the maximum difference. The unit test `assert find_length("11000010001") == 6` ensures that the function works correctly. 

The time complexity of this function is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input string, because it iterates over the string and for each prefix, it counts the number of 0s and 1s. The space complexity is O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the maximum difference and the corresponding number of 0s and 1s. 

This function can be optimized to have a time complexity of O(n) by using a single pass to count the number of 0s and 1s in each prefix of the string. This can be done by maintaining two variables, `zeros` and `ones`, to count the number of 0s and 1s respectively, and updating them as the function iterates over the string. 

Here is the optimized function:
```
def find_length(s):
    max_diff = 0
    zeros = 0
    ones = 0
    for c in s:
        if c == '0':
            zeros += 1
        else:
            ones += 1
        diff = abs(zeros - ones)
        if diff > max_diff:
            max_diff = diff
    return max_diff
```
This function has the same output as the original function, but it is more efficient and has a time complexity of O(n).
