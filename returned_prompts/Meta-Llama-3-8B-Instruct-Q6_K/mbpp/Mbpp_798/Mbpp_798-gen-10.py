```
def _sum(array):
    return sum(array)
```
The problem asks for a function that calculates the sum of an array. The unit test provided suggests that the function should take an array as an argument and return the sum of its elements. 

In Python, the built-in `sum` function can be used to calculate the sum of an array. So, the solution is to define a function `_sum` that takes an array as an argument and returns the sum of its elements using the `sum` function. 

Here is the solution:
```
def _sum(array):
    return sum(array)
```
This function will pass the unit test provided, which checks if the sum of the array `[1, 2, 3]` is indeed `6`. 

Note that this solution assumes that the input is a list (or array) of numbers. If the input can be of a different type, additional error checking may be necessary.
