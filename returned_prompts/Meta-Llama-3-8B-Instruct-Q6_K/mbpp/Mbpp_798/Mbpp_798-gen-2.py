```
def _sum(arr):
    return sum(arr)
```
This function uses the built-in `sum` function in python to add up all the elements in the array. The unit test provided ensures that the function works correctly. For example, `_sum([1, 2, 3])` should return `6`. 

The `sum` function is a part of Python's standard library, and it is a built-in function that returns the sum of all elements in an iterable. It can be used with lists, tuples, dictionaries, and other iterable types. In this case, it is used with a list. 

Note: The name of the function is preceded by an underscore `_` which is a common convention in Python for naming internal or helper functions. This function can be used as a standalone function or as part of a larger program.
