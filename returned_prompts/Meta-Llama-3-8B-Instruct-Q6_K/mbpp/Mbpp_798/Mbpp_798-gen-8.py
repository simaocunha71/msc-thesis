```
def _sum(arr):
    return sum(arr)
```


The problem asks for a Python function that calculates the sum of an array. The unit test provided, `assert _sum([1, 2, 3]) == 6`, indicates that the function should return the sum of all elements in the array.

The solution is a simple function called `_sum` that takes an array as input and returns the sum of its elements using the built-in `sum` function. The unit test passes when the function is implemented as shown above.
