```
def _sum(arr):
    return sum(arr)
```
The unit test `assert _sum([1, 2, 3]) == 6` suggests that we need to write a function that calculates the sum of a given array. We can use the built-in `sum` function in Python to achieve this. Here's the solution:
```
def _sum(arr):
    return sum(arr)
```
This function takes an array as input and returns the sum of its elements. The unit test `assert _sum([1, 2, 3]) == 6` passes, indicating that the function works correctly.
