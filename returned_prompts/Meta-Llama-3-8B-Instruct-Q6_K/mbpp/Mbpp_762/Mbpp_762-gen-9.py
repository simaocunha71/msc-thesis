```
def check_monthnumber_number(month):
    if month in [1,3,5,7,8,10,12]:
        return False
    else:
        return True
```




The problem is asking to create a function that checks whether a given month number contains 30 days or not. The month numbers are given as integers from 1 to 12.

The provided unit test `assert check_monthnumber_number(6)==True` suggests that the function should return `True` for months with 30 days and `False` for months with less than 30 days. This is because month 6 (June) has 30 days.

Here's the Python function to solve the problem:
```
def check_monthnumber_number(month):
    if month in [1,3,5,7,8,10,12]:
        return False
    else:
        return True
```
This function works by checking if the given month number is in the list of months with less than 30 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, and December). If the month is in this list, the function returns `False`, indicating that the month has less than 30 days. Otherwise, it returns `True`, indicating that the month has 30 days.
