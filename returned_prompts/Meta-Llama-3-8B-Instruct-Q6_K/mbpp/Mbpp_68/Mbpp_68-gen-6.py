The problem is asking you to create a function that checks if a given array is monotonic or not. A monotonic array is either monotonically increasing or monotonically decreasing.

Here's a Python function that solves this problem:

```Python
def is_Monotonic(arr):
    increasing = decreasing = True
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] > arr[i - 1]:
            decreasing = False
        elif arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
            increasing = False
    return increasing or decreasing
```

This function works by iterating over the array and checking if each element is greater than or less than the previous one. If it finds an element that's neither greater nor less than the previous one, it sets the corresponding boolean variable to False. Finally, it returns whether the array is increasing or decreasing.

The unit test `assert is_Monotonic([6, 5, 4, 4]) == True` suggests that the function should return True for an array that is either increasing or decreasing. Therefore, we can modify the function to return True as soon as it finds an increasing or decreasing sequence. This is what the function does now. It returns True if the array is either increasing or decreasing, and False otherwise. This matches the expected output for the given unit test. 

For example, the array [6, 5, 4, 4] is decreasing, so the function should return True for this array. Similarly, the array [1, 2, 3, 4] is increasing, so the function should return True for this array as well. The function will return False for arrays that are neither increasing nor decreasing, such as [1, 3, 2, 4].
