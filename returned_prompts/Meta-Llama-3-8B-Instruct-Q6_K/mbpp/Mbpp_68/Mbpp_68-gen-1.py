The problem is asking to write a function that checks if a given array is monotonic or not. An array is considered monotonic if it's either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.

The unit test `assert is_Monotonic([6, 5, 4, 4]) == True` suggests that the array [6, 5, 4, 4] is considered monotonic because it's either increasing or decreasing.

Here's a python function that solves the problem:

```python
def is_Monotonic(arr):
    increasing = all(arr[i] <= arr[i+1] for i in range(len(arr)-1))
    decreasing = all(arr[i] >= arr[i+1] for i in range(len(arr)-1))
    return increasing or decreasing
```

This function works by checking if the array is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. It uses the `all` function to check if all elements in the array satisfy the condition. If the array is either increasing or decreasing, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.  The unit test `assert is_Monotonic([6, 5, 4, 4]) == True` should pass with this function.
