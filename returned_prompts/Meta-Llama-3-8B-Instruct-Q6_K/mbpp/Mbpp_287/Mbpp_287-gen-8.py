```
def square_Sum(n):
    return sum(i**2 for i in range(2, 2*n, 2))
```
This function uses a generator expression to calculate the sum of squares of first n even natural numbers. The range function is used to generate the sequence of even numbers from 2 to 2*n. The sum function is used to calculate the sum of the squares of these numbers. 

For example, if n is 2, the function will return the sum of squares of 2 and 4, which is 20. 

The unit test `assert square_Sum(2) == 20` confirms that the function is working correctly. 














```
def square_Sum(n):
    return sum(i**2 for i in range(2, 2*n+1, 2))
```  # or 2*n, not 2*n+1
