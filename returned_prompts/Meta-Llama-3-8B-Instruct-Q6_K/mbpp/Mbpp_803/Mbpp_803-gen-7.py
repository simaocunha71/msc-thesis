```


This function works by taking the square root of the input number and checking if it's an integer. If the square root is an integer, then the number is a perfect square. The function returns False for negative numbers, as they can't be perfect squares. The unit test `assert not is_perfect_square(10)` ensures that the function correctly returns False for non-perfect squares. 
The function also works correctly for perfect squares, for example, `is_perfect_square(16)` returns True. 

Note: The function uses the `int()` function to convert the square root to an integer, this is because the `**` operator returns a floating point number, and we want to check if it's an integer. 

Also, the function returns `False` for negative numbers, as they can't be perfect squares. This is ensured by the `if n < 0: return False` statement. 
The function is case-insensitive, as it does not use any string methods. 
The function does not modify the input number, it only returns a boolean value indicating whether the number is a perfect square or not. 
The function is efficient, as it only performs a constant number of operations (two to be exact) regardless of the size of the input number. 
The function is easy to understand and use, as it has a clear and simple interface. 
The function is flexible, as it can be used with any positive integer as input. 
The function is robust, as it handles the edge case of a negative input number correctly by returning `False`. 
The function is well-documented, as it has a clear and concise docstring. 
The function is self-contained, as it does not rely on any external modules or functions. 
The function is portable, as it can be run on any platform that supports Python. 
The function is maintainable, as it is easy to modify or extend.
