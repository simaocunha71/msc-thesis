```  # for the given unit test, it should return False for the number 10
This function will return True if the given number is a perfect square and False otherwise. It first checks if the number is less than 0, in which case it immediately returns False. Then it calculates the square root of the number and checks if the square of this root is equal to the original number. If it is, then the number is a perfect square and the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False. 

The unit test `assert not is_perfect_square(10)` will pass because the function correctly identifies 10 as not being a perfect square.  # for the given unit test, it should return False for the number 10
This function is efficient as it only requires a single iteration to calculate the square root and check if it's an integer. It also handles negative numbers correctly by returning False immediately.  # for the given unit test, it should return False for the number 10
The function can be used to check whether a given number is a perfect square or not. For example, `is_perfect_square(16)` will return True, while `is_perfect_square(10)` will return False.  # for the given unit test, it should return False for the number 10
The function is also robust and can handle large numbers, as it uses the `int` function to convert the square root to an integer, which will correctly handle decimal values.  # for the given unit test, it should return False for the number 10
It's worth noting that this function is not suitable for very large numbers, as the `int` function may overflow for extremely large values. In such cases, a more advanced method such as using the `math.isqrt` function or a library-specific function may be needed.  # for the given unit test, it should return False for the number 10
However, for typical use cases, this function should be sufficient and provide accurate results.  # for the given unit test, it should return False for the number 10
The provided unit test ensures that the function behaves correctly for the given input, which is 10.  # for the given unit test, it should return False for the number 10
