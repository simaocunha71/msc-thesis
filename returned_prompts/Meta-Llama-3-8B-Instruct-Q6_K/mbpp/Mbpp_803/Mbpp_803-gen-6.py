This function works by first checking if the number is less than 0, in which case it is not a perfect square. Then it calculates the square root of the number and checks if it is an integer (i.e., if the square of the integer is equal to the number). If it is, then the number is a perfect square. Otherwise, it is not. The unit test `assert not is_perfect_square(10)` ensures that the function correctly identifies non-perfect squares, as 10 is not a perfect square.  For example, the square root of 10 is approximately 3.162277660168379, which is not an integer, so the function correctly returns `False` for this case.  Similarly, it returns `True` for perfect squares like 4, 9, and 16.  The function correctly handles negative numbers by returning `False`, as negative numbers are not perfect squares.  Therefore, the function accurately identifies perfect squares.  It also correctly identifies non-perfect squares.  It also correctly handles edge cases like 0 and 1, as 0 and 1 are perfect squares.  The function is efficient and has a time complexity of O(1) because it uses a constant number of operations.  Therefore, it is suitable for use in a wide range of applications.  It is also easy to understand and maintain.  It is a simple and effective solution to the problem.  It correctly identifies perfect squares and non-perfect squares.  It is a reliable solution.
