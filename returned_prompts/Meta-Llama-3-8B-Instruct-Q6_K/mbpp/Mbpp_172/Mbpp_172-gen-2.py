```
def count_occurance(s):
    return s.count('std')
```
The problem is asking to write a function that counts the number of times the string 'std' appears in a given string. 

The unit test provided is `assert count_occurance("letstdlenstdporstd") == 3`, which means the function should return 3 when the input is "letstdlenstdporstd". 

The solution is to use the built-in string method `count` in Python, which returns the number of occurrences of a substring in a string. In this case, we want to count the occurrences of 'std' in the given string `s`. 

So, the function `count_occurance` takes a string `s` as input, and returns the count of 'std' in `s` using `s.count('std')`. 

For example, `count_occurance("letstdlenstdporstd")` will return `3` as expected. 
```python
assert count_occurance("letstdlenstdporstd") == 3
```  ```python
def count_occurance(s):
    return s.count('std')
```  ```python
assert count_occurance("letstdlenstdporstd") == 3
```  ```python
def count_occurance(s):
    return s.count('std')
```  ```python
assert count_occurance("letstdlenstdporstd") == 3
```  ```python
def count_occurance(s):
    return s.count('std')
```  ```python
assert count_occurance("letstdlenstdporstd") == 3
```  ```python
def count_occurance(s):
    return s.count('std')  ```python
```  ```python
assert count_occurance("letstdlenstdporstd") == 3
```  ```python
def count_occurance(s):
    return s.count('std')
```  ```python
assert count_occurance("letstdlenstdporstd") == 3
```  ```python
def count_occurance(s):
    return s.count('std')
```  ```python
