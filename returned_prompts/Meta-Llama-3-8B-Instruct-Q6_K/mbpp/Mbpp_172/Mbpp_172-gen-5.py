```
def count_occurance(s):
    return s.count('std')
```
The problem is asking to write a function that counts the number of occurrences of the string 'std' in a given string. The function should return the count of 'std' in the string. 

The unit test `assert count_occurance("letstdlenstdporstd") == 3` suggests that the function should return 3 for the given string "letstdlenstdporstd" because 'std' appears three times in the string.

The solution is to use the built-in `count` method of the string in Python, which returns the number of occurrences of the specified string in the given string. 

In the given problem, we can use `s.count('std')` to count the number of occurrences of 'std' in the string `s`. This will return the count of 'std' in the string.
