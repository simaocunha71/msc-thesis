```
def number_ctr(s):
    return len([i for i in s if i.isdigit()])
``` 
The given problem is asking to write a python function that counts the number of digits in a given string. 

The unit test provided is `assert number_ctr('program2bedone') == 1`, which means the function should return 1 for the given string 'program2bedone' because there is only one digit '2' in the string.

The provided solution is a list comprehension that iterates over each character in the string and checks if the character is a digit using the `isdigit()` method. The length of the list is then returned as the count of digits.

This solution works for the given unit test and should work for any string that contains digits. However, it may not work correctly for strings that contain non-ASCII digits (e.g., Arabic or Hindi digits). In such cases, a more complex solution that uses regular expressions or Unicode character properties may be needed.
