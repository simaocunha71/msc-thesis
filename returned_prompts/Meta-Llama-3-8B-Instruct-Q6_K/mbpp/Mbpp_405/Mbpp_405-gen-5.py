```
def check_tuplex(tup, element):
    return element in tup
```


The function `check_tuplex` takes two parameters: `tup` which is a tuple and `element` which is the element to be checked in the tuple. It returns `True` if the element exists in the tuple and `False` otherwise. 

The unit test `assert check_tuplex(("w", 3, "r", "e", "s", "o", "u", "r", "c", "e"),'r')==True` checks whether the element 'r' exists in the tuple. The function correctly returns `True` as 'r' is present in the tuple.  If 'r' was not present in the tuple, the function would return `False`. 

This function uses Python's built-in `in` operator which returns `True` if the element is found in the tuple, and `False` otherwise. This operator works with tuples, lists, strings, etc. 

This function is case-sensitive, meaning it treats 'r' and 'R' as different elements. If you want a case-insensitive check, you would need to convert both the tuple and the element to lower case (or upper case) before checking. For example: `return element.lower() in [x.lower() for x in tup]`.  However, this would also convert the tuple, which might not be what you want.  If you want to leave the tuple unchanged, you could create a copy of the tuple and convert the copy: `return element.lower() in [x.lower() for x in tup[:]]`.  But this is getting quite complex, so it's usually better to just use the `in` operator and deal with the case sensitivity.  If you're working with a lot of strings and you need a case-insensitive check, you might want to consider using a different data structure, like a set, which is case-insensitive by default.  But this would require a significant change to your code.  For a simple function like this, the `in` operator is usually the best choice.  It's easy to use and it works well.  But it's not suitable for all situations.  It's always a good idea to think about the requirements of your function and choose the best tool for the job.  If you're not sure what the best tool is, you can always try a few different options and see which one works best.
