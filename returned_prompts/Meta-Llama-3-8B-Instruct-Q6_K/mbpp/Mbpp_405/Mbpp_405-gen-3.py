```
def check_tuplex(tuplex, element):
    return element in tuplex
```





The function `check_tuplex` takes two parameters: `tuplex` which is a tuple, and `element` which is the element to be searched within the tuple. It returns `True` if the element is found in the tuple, and `False` otherwise.

The unit test provided, `assert check_tuplex(("w", 3, "r", "e", "s", "o", "u", "r", "c", "e"),'r')==True`, suggests that the function should return `True` when the element 'r' is found in the tuple.

This function uses the `in` operator, which checks if the element is present in the tuple. If the element is found, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
