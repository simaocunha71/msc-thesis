```
def check_tuplex(tuplex, element):
    return element in tuplex
```
The provided unit test `assert check_tuplex(("w", 3, "r", "e", "s", "o", "u", "r", "c", "e"),'r')==True` suggests that the function should check if the given element exists within the tuple. The `in` operator in Python can be used to check if an element exists within a tuple. 

So, the function `check_tuplex` takes two parameters: `tuplex` which is the tuple to be searched and `element` which is the element to be searched for. It returns `True` if the element exists within the tuple and `False` otherwise. 

Here is the Python code for the function:
```
def check_tuplex(tuplex, element):
    return element in tuplex
``` 





The function is defined as follows:
```
def check_tuplex(tuplex, element):
    return element in tuplex
```
This function takes two parameters: `tuplex` which is the tuple to be searched, and `element` which is the element to be searched for. It returns `True` if the element exists within the tuple and `False` otherwise.

This function is a simple and efficient way to check if an element exists within a tuple. It can be used in a variety of situations, such as data validation, searching for specific values, or checking for the presence of certain elements.
