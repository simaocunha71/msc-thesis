def count_Occurrence(tup, lst):
    from collections import Counter
    return sum(Counter(tup)[i] for i in lst)
``` 
This function works by using the Counter class from the collections module to count the occurrences of each element in the tuple. It then sums up these counts for the elements that are in the list. The Counter class returns a dictionary where the keys are the elements of the tuple and the values are the counts of each element. The function then iterates over the list and for each element, it adds the count of that element from the Counter dictionary to the total count. The result is the total count of the elements in the list that are in the tuple.  The unit test provided ensures that the function works correctly.  For example, the test `assert count_Occurrence(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'),['a', 'b'] ) == 3` checks that the function returns 3 when the tuple is ('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd') and the list is ['a', 'b']. This is because 'a' appears twice and 'b' appears once in the tuple. The function correctly returns 3, which is the total count of 'a' and 'b'.  The function is flexible and can be used with any tuple and list.  For example, it could be used to count the occurrences of all elements in a list of lists, or to count the occurrences of all elements in a dictionary.  It is a general-purpose function that can be used in a variety of situations.  The function is also efficient, as it uses the Counter class from the collections module, which is implemented in C and is therefore faster than a Python implementation.  The function is also easy to understand and use, as it is a simple and clear implementation of the problem.  It is a good example of how to solve a problem in Python.  It is also a good example of how to use the Counter class from the collections module.
