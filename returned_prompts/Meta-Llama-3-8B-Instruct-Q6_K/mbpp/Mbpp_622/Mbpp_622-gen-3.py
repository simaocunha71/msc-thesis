```
def get_median(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    median = (merged_list[size//2 - 1] + merged_list[size//2]) / 2
    return median
```


The problem is asking to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The median is the middle value of the combined list, which is calculated by averaging the two middle values if the length of the list is even.

The unit test `assert get_median([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5) == 16.0` suggests that the function should take three parameters: the two lists and the size of the lists. The function first merges the two lists and then finds the median.

Here is the solution in Python:
```
def get_median(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    median = (merged_list[size//2 - 1] + merged_list[size//2]) / 2
    return median
```
This function works by first merging the two lists into one sorted list. Then, it calculates the median by averaging the two middle values of the list. If the length of the list is odd, the median is the middle value. If the length of the list is even, the median is the average of the two middle values. The function returns the calculated median.
