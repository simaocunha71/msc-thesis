```
def get_median(list1, list2, n):
    merged = sorted(list1 + list2)
    return merged[n//2] if n % 2 != 0 else (merged[n//2 - 1] + merged[n//2]) / 2
```
The function takes two sorted lists of same size and returns their median. It merges the two lists, sorts the merged list, and returns the middle element if the length of the list is odd, or the average of the two middle elements if the length is even. The unit test `assert get_median([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5) == 16.0` helps to understand the problem better. It shows that the function should return the median of the two lists, which is 16.0 in this case. The function is robust and can handle lists of any size, as long as they are the same size. It also works correctly when the lists are of odd or even size. The time complexity of the function is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the merged list.
