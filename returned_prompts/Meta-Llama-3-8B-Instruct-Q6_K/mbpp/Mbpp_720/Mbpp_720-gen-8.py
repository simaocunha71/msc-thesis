def add_dict_to_tuple(t, d):
    return t + (d,)
```
This function adds a dictionary to the tuple. The dictionary is added as a single element in the tuple. The unit test `assert add_dict_to_tuple((4, 5, 6), {"MSAM" : 1, "is" : 2, "best" : 3} ) == (4, 5, 6, {'MSAM': 1, 'is': 2, 'best': 3})` shows that this function works correctly. The output is a tuple where the last element is the dictionary.  The `+` operator is overloaded to concatenate tuples in Python. When the `+` operator is used with a tuple and a single element (like a dictionary), it adds the single element to the end of the tuple. The `(d,)` syntax is used to make the dictionary a single element in the tuple, not a dictionary with a single element.  Without the comma, `(d)` would be a dictionary with a single element, not a single element in the tuple.  The comma is necessary to make `d` a single element in the tuple.  Without it, Python would treat `d` as a dictionary and not as a single element in the tuple.  This is why `(d,)` is used instead of `(d)`.  This is a common pattern in Python when you want to add a single element to a tuple.  This is why it is used in this function.
