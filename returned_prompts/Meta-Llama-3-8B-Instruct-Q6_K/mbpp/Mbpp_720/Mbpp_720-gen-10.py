```
def add_dict_to_tuple(tup, dictionary):
    new_tuple = tup + (dictionary,)
    return new_tuple
```
This function takes a tuple and a dictionary as input, and returns a new tuple that includes the dictionary. The dictionary is added to the end of the tuple. The unit test provided ensures that the function works correctly. 

For example, `add_dict_to_tuple((4, 5, 6), {"MSAM" : 1, "is" : 2, "best" : 3} )` would return `(4, 5, 6, {'MSAM': 1, 'is': 2, 'best': 3})`. 

The `+` operator is used to concatenate the tuple and the dictionary, which is a valid operation in Python. The resulting tuple includes the dictionary as its last element. 

The unit test `assert add_dict_to_tuple((4, 5, 6), {"MSAM" : 1, "is" : 2, "best" : 3} ) == (4, 5, 6, {'MSAM': 1, 'is': 2, 'best': 3})` ensures that the function works correctly by comparing the output of the function to the expected output. If the function works correctly, this test will pass. If the function does not work correctly, this test will fail, indicating that the function needs to be modified. 





This code defines a function called `add_dict_to_tuple` that takes two parameters: a tuple `tup` and a dictionary `dictionary`. It returns a new tuple that includes the dictionary.

The function uses the `+` operator to concatenate the tuple and the dictionary. This is a valid operation in Python, and it creates a new tuple that includes the dictionary as its last element.

The unit test provided ensures that the function works correctly. It checks that the output of the function is equal to the expected output. If the function works correctly, this test will pass. If the function does not work correctly, this test will fail, indicating that the function needs to be modified.

This code is a simple and effective solution to the problem. It uses the built-in `+` operator to concatenate the tuple and the dictionary, which is a valid operation in Python. The function is easy to understand and use, and it works correctly according to the unit test provided.
