```
def add_dict_to_tuple(t, d):
    return t + (d,)
```
The problem is asking to create a function that takes a tuple and a dictionary as input, and returns a new tuple that includes the original tuple and the dictionary.

The unit test provided helps to clarify the expected output. It shows that the function should concatenate the tuple and dictionary into a new tuple. The unit test is:
```
assert add_dict_to_tuple((4, 5, 6), {"MSAM" : 1, "is" : 2, "best" : 3} ) == (4, 5, 6, {'MSAM': 1, 'is': 2, 'best': 3})
```
To solve this problem, we can use the tuple concatenation operator `+` to combine the original tuple and the dictionary. The dictionary needs to be converted to a tuple first by using the tuple constructor `(d,)`.

Here is the solution:
```
def add_dict_to_tuple(t, d):
    return t + (d,)
```
