```
def add_dict_to_tuple(t, d):
    return t + (d,)
```
This problem is asking you to write a function that takes a tuple and a dictionary as input, and returns a new tuple that includes the original tuple and the dictionary. The dictionary should be added to the end of the tuple.

The unit test provided helps to clarify the problem. It shows that the function should add the dictionary to the end of the tuple, like this: `(4, 5, 6, {'MSAM': 1, 'is': 2, 'best': 3})`.

To solve this problem, you can use the tuple concatenation operator `+`. This operator can be used to combine two tuples into a new tuple. In this case, you would use it to combine the original tuple with a tuple that contains the dictionary. The dictionary should be wrapped in a tuple using the `(d,)` syntax.

Here is the solution:
```
def add_dict_to_tuple(t, d):
    return t + (d,)
```
This function takes two arguments, `t` and `d`. `t` is the original tuple, and `d` is the dictionary. It returns a new tuple that includes the original tuple and the dictionary. The dictionary is added to the end of the tuple using the tuple concatenation operator `+`. The `(d,)` syntax is used to wrap the dictionary in a tuple, so that it can be concatenated with the original tuple.
