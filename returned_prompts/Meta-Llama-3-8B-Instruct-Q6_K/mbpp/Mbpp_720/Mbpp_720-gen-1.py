The problem is asking to create a function that takes a tuple and a dictionary as input, and returns a new tuple that includes the input tuple followed by the input dictionary.

The unit test `assert add_dict_to_tuple((4, 5, 6), {"MSAM" : 1, "is" : 2, "best" : 3} ) == (4, 5, 6, {'MSAM': 1, 'is': 2, 'best': 3})` suggests that the dictionary should be appended to the end of the tuple.

Here is a Python function that accomplishes this:

```python
def add_dict_to_tuple(t, d):
    return t + (d,)
```

This function uses Python's tuple concatenation feature, which allows you to combine two tuples into a new tuple. The `(d,)` syntax is used to convert the dictionary to a tuple, since Python does not allow direct concatenation of tuples and dictionaries. The resulting tuple is then returned by the function.
