The task is to create a function that adds a dictionary to an existing tuple and returns the result as a tuple. 

The unit test provided helps clarify the expected output format, which is a tuple containing the original tuple and the dictionary.

Here's the Python function that accomplishes this:

```python
def add_dict_to_tuple(t, d):
    return t + (d,)
```

This function uses Python's tuple concatenation feature, where the `+` operator is used to combine two or more tuples. The dictionary is converted to a tuple using the `(d,)` syntax, which is necessary because dictionaries cannot be added directly to tuples. The resulting tuple contains the original tuple `t` and the dictionary `d`. 

For example, if we call `add_dict_to_tuple((4, 5, 6), {"MSAM" : 1, "is" : 2, "best" : 3} )`, the output will be `(4, 5, 6, {'MSAM': 1, 'is': 2, 'best': 3})`. 

This solution passes the provided unit test.
