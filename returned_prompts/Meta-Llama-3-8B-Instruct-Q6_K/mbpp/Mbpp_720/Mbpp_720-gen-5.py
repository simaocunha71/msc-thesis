```
def add_dict_to_tuple(tup, dict_in):
    return tup + (dict_in,)
```


The problem asks to create a function that takes a tuple and a dictionary as input, and returns a new tuple that includes the input tuple and the input dictionary.

The unit test provided helps to clarify the expected output. It shows that the input tuple is `(4, 5, 6)` and the input dictionary is `{"MSAM" : 1, "is" : 2, "best" : 3}`, and the expected output is `(4, 5, 6, {'MSAM': 1, 'is': 2, 'best': 3})`.

To solve this problem, we can use Python's tuple concatenation feature, which allows us to combine two tuples into a new tuple. In this case, we combine the input tuple with a new tuple that contains the input dictionary. We use the `+` operator to concatenate the tuples, and the `(dict_in, )` syntax to create a tuple from the dictionary.

Here is the solution:
```
def add_dict_to_tuple(tup, dict_in):
    return tup + (dict_in,)
```
This function takes two arguments, `tup` and `dict_in`, and returns a new tuple that includes the input tuple and the input dictionary. The `+` operator is used to concatenate the tuples, and the `(dict_in, )` syntax is used to create a tuple from the dictionary. The resulting tuple is returned as the output of the function.
