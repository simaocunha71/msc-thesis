```
def sum_negativenum(lst):
    return sum(num for num in lst if num < 0)
```


The unit test provided is:
```
assert sum_negativenum([2, 4, -6, -9, 11, -12, 14, -5, 17])==-32
```

This test checks if the function `sum_negativenum` correctly calculates the sum of the negative numbers in the given list. The expected output is `-32`, which is the sum of the negative numbers in the list `[-6, -9, -12, -5]`. 

The function uses a generator expression to iterate over the list, filtering out the negative numbers and summing them up. The built-in `sum` function is used to calculate the sum of the filtered numbers. 

This solution passes the provided unit test. 
```
print(sum_negativenum([2, 4, -6, -9, 11, -12, 14, -5, 17])) # Output: -32
```
