The problem is asking to create a function that calculates a dog's age in dog years. The function should take the dog's age in human years as an input and return the equivalent age in dog years.

However, the problem does not specify the exact conversion rate from human years to dog years. But, based on the provided unit test `assert dog_age(12)==61`, we can assume that the conversion rate is 5 human years equal to 1 dog year for the first two years, and 4 human years equal to 1 dog year after that.

Here is the Python solution for the problem:

```python
def dog_age(human_age):
    if human_age <= 2:
        return human_age * 5
    else:
        return 10 + (human_age - 2) * 4
``` 





```
def dog_age(human_age):
    if human_age <= 2:
        return human_age * 5
    else:
        return 10 + (human_age - 2) * 4
```

This function takes the human age as an input and returns the equivalent age in dog years. If the human age is less than or equal to 2, it returns the human age multiplied by 5. If the human age is more than 2, it returns 10 plus the difference between the human age and 2, multiplied by 4. This is based on the assumption that the first two years of a dog's life are equivalent to 5 human years, and each subsequent year is equivalent to 4 human years.
