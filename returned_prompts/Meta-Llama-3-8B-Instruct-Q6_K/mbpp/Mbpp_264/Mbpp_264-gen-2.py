The problem is asking to create a function that calculates a dog's age in dog years. However, the problem description does not specify the conversion rate from human years to dog years. 

Fortunately, the unit test `assert dog_age(12)==61` provides a hint about the conversion rate. Assuming that the first two years of a dog's life are equal to 10.5 years and each subsequent year is equal to 4 years, we can write the function as follows:

```
def dog_age(human_years):
    if human_years <= 2:
        return human_years * 10.5
    else:
        return 21 + (human_years - 2) * 4
```

This function takes the dog's age in human years as input and returns the dog's age in dog years. The function uses an if-else statement to determine whether the dog is less than or equal to 2 years old. If the dog is less than or equal to 2 years old, the function returns the human years multiplied by 10.5. If the dog is more than 2 years old, the function returns 21 (which is the equivalent of 2 years in dog years) plus the difference between the human years and 2, multiplied by 4. This is based on the assumption that the first two years of a dog's life are equal to 10.5 years and each subsequent year is equal to 4 years.
