This solution assumes that the first two years of a dog's life are equivalent to 24 years for a human, and each year after that is equivalent to 4 years for a human. The function takes the human age as input and returns the dog's age in dog years. If the human age is less than 2, the function simply multiplies it by 24. If the human age is 2 or more, the function returns 2 * 24 (for the first two years) plus the number of years after that multiplied by 4. The test case `print(dog_age(12))` is used to verify that the function returns the correct result.
