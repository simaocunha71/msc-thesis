def long_words(n, words):
  return [word for word in words.split() if len(word) > n]  # Python's built-in list comprehension is used here. The condition 'len(word) > n' filters the words that are longer than 'n'. The 'for' loop iterates over the words in the given list. The 'if' condition checks whether the length of each word is greater than 'n'. The words that satisfy this condition are included in the output list. The 'split()' function is used to split the string into a list of words. The 'in' operator is used to check whether a word is present in the list. The 'split()' function is used to split the string into a list of words.
