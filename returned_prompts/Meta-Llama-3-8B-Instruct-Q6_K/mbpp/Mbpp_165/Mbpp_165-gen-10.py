```
def count_char_position(s):
    s = s.lower()
    alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
    return sum(1 for a, c in zip(alphabet, s) if a == c)
```





Solution:
The problem is asking to count the number of characters in a string that occur at the same position in the string as in the English alphabet (case insensitive). For example, if the string is "xbcefg", the function should return 2 because 'b' and 'c' occur at the same position as in the English alphabet.

The unit test `assert count_char_position("xbcefg") == 2` helps to clarify this.

Here's a Python solution for the problem:

```python
def count_char_position(s):
    s = s.lower()
    alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
    return sum(1 for a, c in zip(alphabet, s) if a == c)
```

This function works by iterating over the English alphabet and the input string simultaneously using the `zip` function. It then checks if the current character in the string is the same as the current character in the alphabet (ignoring case by converting the string to lowercase). If they are the same, it counts it. The `sum` function is used to add up the counts. The result is the number of characters in the string that occur at the same position as in the English alphabet.
