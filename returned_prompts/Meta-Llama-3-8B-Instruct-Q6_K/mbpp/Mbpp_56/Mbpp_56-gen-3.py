```
def check(n):
    reverse = int(str(n)[::-1])
    return n == 2*reverse - 1
``` 
The function takes an integer as input and checks if it is one less than twice its reverse. It converts the integer to a string, reverses the string, converts it back to an integer, and then checks if the original number is equal to two times the reversed number minus 1. If it is, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. 

The unit test `assert check(70) == False` suggests that the function should return False for the input 70, indicating that 70 is not one less than twice its reverse. 

This function passes the given unit test, but it's worth noting that it may not cover all possible edge cases or corner cases. Depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the problem, additional tests or modifications to the function may be necessary.
