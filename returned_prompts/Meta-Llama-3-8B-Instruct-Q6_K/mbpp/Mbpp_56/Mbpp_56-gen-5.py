```
def check(n):
    rev = int(str(n)[::-1])  # reverse the number
    return n == 2 * rev - 1  # check if the number is one less than twice its reverse
``` 

Explanation:
The function `check(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and checks if it satisfies the condition that it is one less than twice its reverse. The reverse of a number is obtained by converting the number to a string, reversing the string, and then converting it back to an integer. The function returns `True` if the number satisfies the condition and `False` otherwise. 

The unit test `assert check(70) == False` ensures that the function returns `False` for the input `70`, as 70 is not one less than twice its reverse. 

The function works by first reversing the input number using the expression `int(str(n)[::-1])`. This expression converts the number to a string, reverses the string using slicing (`[::-1]`), and then converts the reversed string back to an integer. 

The function then checks if the original number is equal to two times the reversed number minus 1 using the expression `n == 2 * rev - 1`. If the number satisfies this condition, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

For example, if the input is `70`, the function first reverses `70` to get `07`, then checks if `70` is equal to `2 * 07 - 1`, which is `False`. Therefore, the function returns `False` for the input `70`. 

The function is designed to work with any positive integer input, and it returns `False` for all inputs that do not satisfy the condition that they are one less than twice their reverse. 

The unit test `assert check(70) == False` ensures that the function returns the correct result for the input `70`. 

This function is efficient and works correctly for all positive integer inputs. 

Note: This function does not handle non-integer inputs. If you want to handle non-integer inputs, you can add error handling code to the function. For example, you can use a try-except block to catch and handle `ValueError` exceptions that occur when the input is not an integer. 

Here is an example of how you can modify the function to handle non-integer inputs:
```
def check(n):
    try:
        rev = int(str(n
