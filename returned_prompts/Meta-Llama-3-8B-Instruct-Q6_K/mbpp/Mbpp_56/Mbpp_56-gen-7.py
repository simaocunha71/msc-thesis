```
def check(n):
    rev = int(str(n)[::-1])
    return n == 2*rev - 1
```





Python function to check if a given number is one less than twice its reverse.

The problem is asking to write a function that takes an integer as input and checks if the number is equal to one less than twice its reverse. The reverse of a number is obtained by reversing its digits.

For example, the reverse of the number 123 is 321.

The function should return True if the number is one less than twice its reverse, and False otherwise.

Here is a Python function that solves the problem:

```
def check(n):
    rev = int(str(n)[::-1])
    return n == 2*rev - 1
```

This function first converts the input number to a string, reverses the string using slicing (`[::-1]`), and then converts the reversed string back to an integer. It then checks if the original number is equal to one less than twice its reverse, and returns True or False accordingly.

The unit test `assert check(70) == False` helps to clarify the problem by providing an example of a number that is not one less than twice its reverse. This test can be used to verify that the function is working correctly.
