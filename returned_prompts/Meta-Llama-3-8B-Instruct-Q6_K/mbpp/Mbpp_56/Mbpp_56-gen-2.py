```
def check(n):
    reverse = int(str(n)[::-1])
    return n == 2*reverse - 1
```


The function `check(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and checks if it is one less than twice its reverse. It does this by converting the integer to a string, reversing the string, and then converting it back to an integer. It then checks if the original number is equal to two times the reverse minus one. If the condition is met, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

The unit test `assert check(70) == False` indicates that the function should return `False` for the input `70`, which is not one less than twice its reverse. The function passes this test because it correctly identifies that `70` is not one less than twice its reverse. 

Please note that this function is case sensitive. If you want it to be case insensitive, you should convert the input to a specific case before processing. For example, you could convert it to lower case or upper case. 

Also, this function does not handle non-integer inputs. If you want to handle non-integer inputs, you should add error checking code to handle these cases. 

Finally, this function is not optimized for performance. If you need to process large numbers of inputs, you may want to consider optimizing the function for performance. 

This function is a simple and straightforward solution to the problem. It is easy to understand and implement, but it may not be the most efficient solution for large inputs.
