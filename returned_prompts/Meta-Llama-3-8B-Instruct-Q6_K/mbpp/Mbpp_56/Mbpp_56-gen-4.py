```
def check(n):
    reverse_n = int(str(n)[::-1])
    return n == 2 * reverse_n - 1
```


The function `check` takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is one less than twice its reverse, and `False` otherwise. 

The reverse of a number can be obtained by converting the number to a string, reversing the string, and then converting it back to an integer. 

The condition `n == 2 * reverse_n - 1` checks if `n` is one less than twice its reverse. 

The unit test `assert check(70) == False` ensures that the function returns the correct result for the input `70`. 

This function will return `False` for `70` because `70` is not one less than twice its reverse. The reverse of `70` is `07`, and `2 * 07 - 1 = 13`, which is not equal to `70`. 

This function will return the correct result for other inputs as well. For example, `check(99)` will return `True` because `99` is one less than twice its reverse. The reverse of `99` is `99`, and `2 * 99 - 1 = 197`, which is equal to `99`.
