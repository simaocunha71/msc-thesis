```
def check(n):
    rev = int(str(n)[::-1])  # reverse the number
    return n == 2*rev - 1  # check if the number is one less than twice its reverse
```


This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is one less than twice its reverse, and `False` otherwise.

The reverse of a number is obtained by converting the number to a string, reversing the string, and then converting it back to an integer. This is done using the expression `int(str(n)[::-1])`.

The function then checks if `n` is equal to twice its reverse minus one. If it is, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is one less than twice its reverse. If it is not, the function returns `False`.

The unit test `assert check(70) == False` suggests that the function should return `False` for the input `70`, which means that `70` is not one less than twice its reverse. This is consistent with the function's behavior, as `70` is not one less than twice its reverse.
