```
def combinations_colors(lst, n):
    from itertools import product
    return list(product(lst, repeat=n))
```


This function uses the `product` function from the `itertools` module to generate all combinations of the elements in the list with repetition. The `repeat` parameter is set to `n`, which means each element in the list will appear `n` times in each combination.

The `list` function is used to convert the result from a generator to a list. The function then returns this list.

The unit test `assert combinations_colors( ["Red","Green","Blue"],1)==[('Red',), ('Green',), ('Blue',)]` confirms that the function works correctly for `n=1`, meaning each element in the list appears once in each combination. For larger values of `n`, the function will generate combinations with more repetitions. For example, `combinations_colors( ["Red","Green","Blue"],2)` would return `[(‘Red’, ‘Red’), (‘Red’, ‘Green’), (‘Red’, ‘Blue’), (‘Green’, ‘Green’), (‘Green’, ‘Blue’), (‘Blue’, ‘Blue’)]`. 

This function assumes that the input list is non-empty and that `n` is a positive integer. If the input list is empty, the function will return an empty list. If `n` is 0, the function will return a list containing a single empty tuple. If `n` is negative, the function will return an empty list. 

This function is case-sensitive and will treat different cases of the same element as different elements. For example, if the input list contains both "Red" and "red", the function will treat them as different elements. If the input list contains different cases of the same element, the function will treat them as different elements. 

The function does not modify the input list. It returns a new list with tuples. The tuples are immutable, so the function does not modify the tuples. 

The function uses the `itertools` module, which is part of the Python standard library. The `itertools` module provides functions that operate on iterables, including combinations, permutations, and accumulations. The `product` function is one of the functions provided by the `itertools` module. It generates the Cartesian product of input iterables. In this case, it generates all combinations of the elements in the list with repetition.
