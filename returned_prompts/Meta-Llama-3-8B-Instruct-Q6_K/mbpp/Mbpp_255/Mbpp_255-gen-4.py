```
def combinations_colors(lst, n):
    from itertools import product
    return list(product(lst, repeat=n))
```
The function uses the product function from the itertools module, which generates the cartesian product of input iterables. The repeat parameter is used to specify how many times to repeat each input iterable. For example, if lst = ["Red", "Green", "Blue"] and n = 1, the function will return [('Red',), ('Green',), ('Blue',)]. If lst = ["Red", "Green", "Blue"] and n = 2, the function will return [('Red', 'Red'), ('Red', 'Green'), ('Red', 'Blue'), ('Green', 'Red'), ('Green', 'Green'), ('Green', 'Blue'), ('Blue', 'Red'), ('Blue', 'Green'), ('Blue', 'Blue')]. 

The result is a list of tuples, where each tuple is a combination of elements from the input list. The combinations are generated with repetition, meaning that an element from the input list can be used multiple times in a combination. The function assumes that the input list contains unique elements. If the input list contains duplicate elements, the function will also generate duplicate combinations. 

The function is tested with the unit test `assert combinations_colors( ["Red","Green","Blue"],1)==[('Red',), ('Green',), ('Blue',)]`, which checks that the function returns the correct combinations when n = 1.  This test case helps to ensure that the function is working correctly for small values of n.  However, it does not cover all possible cases, and additional tests may be needed to ensure that the function is working correctly for all possible inputs.  For example, the function should also work correctly when n is larger than the length of the input list, or when the input list is empty.  Additional tests can be added to cover these cases.  For example, `assert combinations_colors([], 1) == []` tests that the function returns an empty list when the input list is empty, and `assert combinations_colors(["Red"], 5) == [('Red',), ('Red',), ('Red',), ('Red',), ('Red',)]` tests that the function returns the correct combinations when n is larger than the length of the input list.  These additional tests can help to ensure that the function is working correctly for all possible inputs.
