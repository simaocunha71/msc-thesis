def sort_sublists(lst):
  return [sorted(sublist) for sublist in lst]  # Python's built-in sorted() function is used to sort each sublist in-place. The sorted() function returns a new sorted list from the elements of any sequence. The result is a new sorted list from the elements of any sequence. If the sequence contains a list, tuple, or other iterable, the function recursively sorts it. If the sequence contains a dictionary, the function recursively sorts the dictionary items. If the sequence contains a string, the function recursively sorts the string characters. The sorted() function also accepts a key function that takes a list element and returns a value that will be used for sorting purposes. The key function is used to determine the sort order of the elements. The default key function is None, which means that the sorted() function will sort the elements in ascending order based on their values. The sorted() function can also accept a reverse argument that is a boolean value. If the reverse argument is True, the sorted() function will sort the elements in descending order. If the reverse argument is False, the sorted() function will sort the elements in ascending order. The default value of the reverse argument is False.
