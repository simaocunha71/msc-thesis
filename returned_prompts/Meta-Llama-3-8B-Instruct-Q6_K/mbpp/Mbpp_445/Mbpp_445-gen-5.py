```
def index_multiplication(tup1, tup2):
    result = [(a*b) for a, b in zip(tup1, tup2)]
    return tuple(result)
```



The problem asks you to create a function that takes two tuples as input and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of the corresponding elements from the input tuples. For example, if the input tuples are (1, 3) and (6, 7), the output should be (6, 21).

The unit test provided helps clarify the problem by showing an example of the expected output for a given input. The test case is:
assert index_multiplication(((1, 3), (4, 5), (2, 9), (1, 10)),((6, 7), (3, 9), (1, 1), (7, 3)) ) == ((6, 21), (12, 45), (2, 9), (7, 30))

To solve this problem, you can use the built-in zip function in Python, which pairs up the elements from two lists (or in this case, tuples). You can then use a list comprehension to multiply the corresponding elements and convert the result back to a tuple.

Here's the solution:
def index_multiplication(tup1, tup2):
    result = [(a*b) for a, b in zip(tup1, tup2)]
    return tuple(result)

This function works by iterating over the input tuples using the zip function, which returns an iterator of tuples where the first item in each passed iterator is paired together, and then the second item in each passed iterator are paired together etc. The list comprehension then multiplies the corresponding elements from the input tuples and stores the results in a new list. Finally, the function returns this list as a tuple.
