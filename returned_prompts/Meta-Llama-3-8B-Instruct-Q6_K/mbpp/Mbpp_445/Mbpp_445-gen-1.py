Explanation:
The function `index_multiplication` takes two tuples as input and returns a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple is the element-wise multiplication of the corresponding elements in the input tuples.

The function uses the built-in `zip` function to iterate over the elements of the input tuples in parallel. For each pair of elements, it uses a generator expression to compute the element-wise multiplication and creates a new tuple with the results. The resulting tuples are collected in a list, which is then converted to a tuple and returned.

The unit test provided ensures that the function works correctly for the given input tuples. The test case checks that the function returns the expected result for the given input. This test case helps to ensure that the function is working correctly and can be used to verify the correctness of the implementation.
