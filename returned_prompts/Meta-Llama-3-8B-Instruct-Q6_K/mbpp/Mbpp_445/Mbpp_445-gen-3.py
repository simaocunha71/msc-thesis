```
def index_multiplication(t1, t2):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(t1)):
        result.append((t1[i][0]*t2[i][0], t1[i][1]*t2[i][1]))
    return tuple(result)
```



The problem is asking to write a function that takes two tuples of tuples as input and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of the corresponding elements in the input tuples.

The input tuples contain two elements each, and the function should perform element-wise multiplication of these elements. For example, if the input tuples are ((1, 3), (4, 5)) and ((6, 7), (3, 9)), the output should be ((6, 21), (12, 45)).

The unit test provided is `assert index_multiplication(((1, 3), (4, 5), (2, 9), (1, 10)),((6, 7), (3, 9), (1, 1), (7, 3)) ) == ((6, 21), (12, 45), (2, 9), (7, 30))`.

Here is the solution in Python:
```
def index_multiplication(t1, t2):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(t1)):
        result.append((t1[i][0]*t2[i][0], t1[i][1]*t2[i][1]))
    return tuple(result)
```
This function uses a loop to iterate over the elements of the input tuples. For each element, it multiplies the corresponding elements of the two tuples and appends the result to a new list. Finally, it converts the list to a tuple and returns it.
