"""
The problem is asking to create a function that takes a list and a tuple as input, and returns a new tuple that is a combination of the given tuple and the given list. 

The unit test provided, `assert add_lists([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) == (9, 10, 5, 6, 7)`, suggests that the list should be appended to the end of the tuple.

Here's a Python function that accomplishes this:

```
python
def add_lists(lst, tup):
    return tup + tuple(lst)
```

This function uses the `+` operator to concatenate the tuple and the list. The `tuple()` function is used to convert the list to a tuple, since the `+` operator cannot be used directly with a tuple and a list. The resulting tuple is then returned by the function. 

For example, if we call `add_lists([5, 6, 7], (9, 10))`, the function will return `(9, 10, 5, 6, 7)`, which is the desired output.```python
```python
def add_lists(lst, tup):
    return tup + tuple(lst)

assert add_lists([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) == (9, 10, 5, 6, 7)
