The problem asks to write a function that takes a list and a tuple as input, and returns a new tuple that is a combination of the given tuple and the given list. 

The unit test `assert add_lists([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) == (9, 10, 5, 6, 7)` suggests that the function should concatenate the list to the tuple.

Here is a Python solution for the problem:
```
def add_lists(lst, t):
    return t + tuple(lst)
```
This function uses the `+` operator to concatenate the tuple `t` and the list `lst`. The `tuple()` function is used to convert the list to a tuple, because the `+` operator cannot concatenate a tuple and a list directly. The result is a new tuple that is a combination of the given tuple and the given list.
