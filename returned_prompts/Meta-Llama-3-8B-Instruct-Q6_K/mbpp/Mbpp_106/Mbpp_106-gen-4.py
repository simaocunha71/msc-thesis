```
def add_lists(list, tuples):
    new_tuple = tuples + tuple(list)
    return new_tuple
```


The task is to create a function that appends the elements of a given list to a given tuple. The function should return a new tuple containing the elements of the original tuple followed by the elements of the list.

The problem statement doesn't explicitly specify how the list should be appended to the tuple. However, based on the provided unit test, it seems that the list should be converted to a tuple and then concatenated with the original tuple. This can be achieved using the `+` operator to concatenate tuples and the `tuple()` function to convert the list to a tuple.

Here's a Python solution that implements this approach:
```
def add_lists(list, tuples):
    new_tuple = tuples + tuple(list)
    return new_tuple
```
This function takes two arguments: `list` and `tuples`. It converts the `list` to a tuple using the `tuple()` function and then concatenates it with the `tuples` using the `+` operator. The resulting tuple is then returned.

The provided unit test confirms that this function works as expected:
```
assert add_lists([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) == (9, 10, 5, 6, 7)
```


This test checks that when the function is called with the list `[5, 6, 7]` and the tuple `(9, 10)`, it returns the tuple `(9, 10, 5, 6, 7)`, which is the expected result.
