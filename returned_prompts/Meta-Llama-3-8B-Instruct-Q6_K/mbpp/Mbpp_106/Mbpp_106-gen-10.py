```
def add_lists(lst, tpl):
    return (*tpl, *lst)
```



Explanation:
The problem asks to create a function that takes a list and a tuple as input, and returns a new tuple that combines the elements of the tuple and the list. 

The unit test `assert add_lists([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) == (9, 10, 5, 6, 7)` helps to clarify the problem. It shows that the list should be appended to the tuple, effectively converting the list to a tuple.

The solution uses the `*` operator to unpack the tuple and the list, and then combines them into a new tuple using the `*` operator again. This creates a new tuple that contains all the elements of the original tuple, followed by all the elements of the original list. 

For example, if the input is `add_lists([5, 6, 7], (9, 10))`, the output will be `(9, 10, 5, 6, 7)`. 

This solution works for any list and tuple, not just the ones provided in the unit test. It's a general solution that can be used for any combination of lists and tuples.
