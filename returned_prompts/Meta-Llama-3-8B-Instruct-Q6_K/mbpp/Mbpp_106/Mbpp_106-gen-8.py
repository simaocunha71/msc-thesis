```
def add_lists(list, tuple):
    return tuple(list) + tuple
```



Here's the explanation:

The problem is asking to create a function that appends a given list to a given tuple. 

The unit test `assert add_lists([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) == (9, 10, 5, 6, 7)` suggests that the list should be concatenated to the tuple as a new tuple. 

So, we can use the `tuple(list)` function to convert the list to a tuple and then concatenate it with the original tuple using the `+` operator. 

Here's the solution:
```
def add_lists(list, tuple):
    return tuple(list) + tuple
```
This function takes a list and a tuple as input, converts the list to a tuple using `tuple(list)`, and then concatenates it with the original tuple using `+`. The result is a new tuple that includes all elements from both the list and the tuple.
