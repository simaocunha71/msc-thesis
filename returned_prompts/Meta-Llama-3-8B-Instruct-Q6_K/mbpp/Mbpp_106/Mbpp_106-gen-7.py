```
def add_lists(lst, t):
    t += tuple(lst)
    return t
```


This problem asks you to write a function that takes a list and a tuple as inputs, and returns a new tuple that is the result of appending the list to the tuple. 

The unit test `assert add_lists([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) == (9, 10, 5, 6, 7)` helps to clarify the expected behavior of the function. It shows that the function should concatenate the list to the tuple, without wrapping the list in a tuple. 

Here's a Python solution for the problem:
```
def add_lists(lst, t):
    t += tuple(lst)
    return t
```
This function uses the `+` operator to concatenate the tuple `t` with the tuple representation of the list `lst`. The result is a new tuple that is the concatenation of the original tuple and the list. The function then returns this new tuple. 

For example, if you call `add_lists([5, 6, 7], (9, 10))`, the function will return `(9, 10, 5, 6, 7)`, which is the concatenation of the tuple `(9, 10)` and the list `[5, 6, 7]`. 

This solution passes the given unit test, and it also works for any list and tuple inputs. 
```python
assert add_lists([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) == (9, 10, 5, 6, 7)
```  ```python
assert add_lists([1, 2], (3, 4)) == (3, 4, 1, 2)
```  ```python
assert add_lists([], (1, 2)) == (1, 2)
```  ```python
assert add_lists([1, 2, 3], ()) == (1, 2, 3)
```  ```python
assert add_lists([], []) == ()
```  ```python
assert add_lists([1, 2, 3], [4, 5]) == (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```  ```python
assert add_lists([1, 2], (3, 4, 5)) == (3, 4, 5, 1, 2
