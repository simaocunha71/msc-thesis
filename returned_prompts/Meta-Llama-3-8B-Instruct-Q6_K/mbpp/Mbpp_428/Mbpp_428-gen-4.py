```
def shell_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    gap = n // 2
    
    while gap > 0:
        for i in range(gap, n):
            temp = arr[i]
            j = i
            
            while j >= gap and arr[j - gap] > temp:
                arr[j] = arr[j - gap]
                j -= gap
            
            arr[j] = temp

The problem is asking you to implement the shell sort algorithm, which is a variation of insertion sort that is more efficient for large lists. The idea is to use a gap size and then slide the gap to the right, sorting the list as you go.

The unit test provided is `assert shell_sort([12, 23, 4, 5, 3, 2, 12, 81, 56, 95]) == [2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 12, 23, 56, 81, 95]`, which helps to clarify the expected output.

Here is the solution in Python:
```
def shell_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    gap = n // 2
    
    while gap > 0:
        for i in range(gap, n):
            temp = arr[i]
            j = i
            
            while j >= gap and arr[j - gap] > temp:
                arr[j] = arr[j - gap]
                j -= gap
            
            arr[j] = temp
        
        gap //= 2
    
    return arr
```
This function works by iterating through the list with a gap size, and then sliding the gap to the right, sorting the list as you go. The gap size is reduced by half each time, until it is 0. The function returns the sorted list.
