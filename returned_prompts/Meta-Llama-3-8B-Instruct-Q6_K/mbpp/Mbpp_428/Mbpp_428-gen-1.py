The shell sort algorithm is a type of insertion sort algorithm that uses a gap size to divide the array into subarrays. It then compares elements at the gap distance and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The gap size is gradually decreased until it is 1, at which point the array is sorted.

The provided unit test ensures that the function correctly sorts the array. It checks if the output of the function is the same as the expected output. If the output is not the same, the test fails.

In this solution, we start by initializing the gap size to half the length of the array. Then, we iterate over the array using a nested loop. The outer loop iterates over the array, and the inner loop compares elements at the current gap distance and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. We repeat this process until the gap size is 1, at which point the array is sorted.

Finally, we return the sorted array. The function should work correctly for any input array, as long as it is a list of integers. The unit test provided ensures that the function works correctly for the given input array.
