    while gap > 0:
        for i in range(gap, len(arr)):
            temp = arr[i]
            j = i
            while j >= gap and arr[j - gap] > temp:
                arr[j] = arr[j - gap]
                j -= gap
            arr[j] = temp

This problem is asking you to implement the shell sort algorithm, which is a sorting algorithm that uses insertion sort as a building block. The main idea is to divide the array into subarrays and sort each subarray using insertion sort, then merge the sorted subarrays together.

Here is the implementation of the shell sort algorithm in Python:

```
def shell_sort(arr):
    gap = len(arr) // 2
    while gap > 0:
        for i in range(gap, len(arr)):
            temp = arr[i]
            j = i
            while j >= gap and arr[j - gap] > temp:
                arr[j] = arr[j - gap]
                j -= gap
            arr[j] = temp
        gap //= 2
    return arr
```

This function takes an array as input, and returns the sorted array. The time complexity of this function is O(n log n), where n is the length of the array.

The unit test `assert shell_sort([12, 23, 4, 5, 3, 2, 12, 81, 56, 95]) == [2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 12, 23, 56, 81, 95]` ensures that the function is working correctly. It checks that the output of the function is equal to the expected output. If the output is not equal to the expected output, the test fails and an error message is displayed. If the output is equal to the expected output, the test passes and no error message is displayed.
