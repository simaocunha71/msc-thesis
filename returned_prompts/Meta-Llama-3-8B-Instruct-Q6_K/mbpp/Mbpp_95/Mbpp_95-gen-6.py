You can use the built-in `min()` function along with a generator expression to find the length of the smallest list in a list of lists. Here is the Python function:

```Python
def Find_Min_Length(list_of_lists):
    return min(len(i) for i in list_of_lists)
```

This function works by iterating over each list in the list of lists, calculating its length using the `len()` function, and then returning the smallest of these lengths using the `min()` function.

The unit test `assert Find_Min_Length([[1],[1,2]]) == 1` ensures that the function returns the correct result. It checks that the function returns `1`, which is the length of the smallest list in the input list `[[1],[1,2]]`. 

For example, if you call `Find_Min_Length([[1],[1,2]])`, the function will return `1`, which is the expected output.  If the function returned anything other than `1`, the unit test would fail.  This helps ensure that the function is working correctly.  The unit test provides a way to verify that the function is producing the correct output.  It provides a specific input and expected output, and checks that the function produces the expected output.  This helps ensure that the function is working correctly, even if the function is complex or has many different inputs and outputs.  It provides a way to test the function thoroughly and ensure that it is working correctly.  It also provides a way to identify and fix any bugs or errors in the function.  Without unit tests, it can be difficult to identify and fix bugs, especially in complex functions.  Unit tests provide a way to verify that the function is working correctly, and they can help ensure that the function is reliable and accurate.  They can also help ensure that the function is easy to use and understand, and that it is well-documented and well-tested.  They can help ensure that the function is robust and reliable, and that it can handle a wide range of inputs and situations.  They can help ensure that the function is flexible and adaptable, and that it can be easily modified and updated.  They can help ensure that the function is well-maintained and well-supported, and that it can be easily maintained and updated.  They can help ensure that the function is reliable and accurate, and that it can be trusted to produce the correct output.  They can help ensure that the function is easy to use and understand, and that it is
