Explanation:
The problem is asking to set all even bits of a given number. A bit is even if its position is even (0-based indexing). This can be achieved by using bitwise OR operation. The idea is to use the bitwise right shift operator to shift the bits of the number to the right by one position, and then use the bitwise OR operator to set the bits that were originally set to 1.

The unit test `assert even_bit_set_number(10) == 10` helps to clarify the problem. It means that the function should return the original number if all bits are even. 

For example, the binary representation of 10 is 1010. If we shift it to the right by one position, we get 0101. Then, we use the bitwise OR operator to set the bits that were originally set to 1, resulting in the original number 10. 

The function `even_bit_set_number(n)` takes an integer `n` as input, and returns the modified number with all even bits set. The bitwise OR operator `|` is used to combine the bits of the original number with the shifted bits. The `>> 1` operation shifts the bits to the right by one position, effectively moving the even bits to the odd positions. The `&` operator is not needed because the problem statement only requires setting the even bits, not clearing them. 

This function works for any positive integer `n`, not just 10. It can be tested with other numbers to verify its correctness.
