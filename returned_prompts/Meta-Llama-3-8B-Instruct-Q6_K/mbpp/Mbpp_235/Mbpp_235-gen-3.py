Explanation:
The problem is asking to set all even bits of a given number. This can be achieved by performing a bitwise XOR operation between the given number and its right shifted version by 1.

For example, if the given number is 10 (which is 1010 in binary), its right shifted version by 1 will be 5 (which is 0101 in binary). Performing a bitwise XOR operation between these two numbers will result in 10 (which is 1010 in binary), with all even bits set.

The unit test `assert even_bit_set_number(10) == 10` confirms this, as it expects the output to be 10, which is the number with all even bits set.
