def even_bit_set_number(n):
    result = 0
    i = 0
    while n > 0:
        if (n & 1) == 0:
            result |= 1 << i
        n >>= 1
        i += 1
    return result
```
This function works by iterating through each bit of the number. If the bit is even (i.e., 0), it sets the corresponding bit in the result to 1. The result is then returned.

The unit test `assert even_bit_set_number(10) == 10` is passed because the even bits of 10 are 0 and 2, and setting these bits to 1 results in 10 itself.

The time complexity of this function is O(log n) where n is the input number. This is because we are iterating through each bit of the number, which takes log n time. The space complexity is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of space to store the result and the index. 





Note: In Python, the bitwise AND operator is `&`, the bitwise OR operator is `|`, and the right shift operator is `>>`. The left shift operator is `<<`. These operators work with integers and binary numbers. The bitwise AND operator compares each bit of the first operand to the corresponding bit of the second operand. If both bits are 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the result bit is set to 0. The bitwise OR operator compares each bit of the first operand to the corresponding bit of the second operand. If either bit is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. The right shift operator shifts the bits of its first operand to the right. The left shift operator shifts the bits of its first operand to the left. The shift operators can be used to shift the bits of an integer. The bitwise AND and OR operators can be used to manipulate the bits of an integer.
