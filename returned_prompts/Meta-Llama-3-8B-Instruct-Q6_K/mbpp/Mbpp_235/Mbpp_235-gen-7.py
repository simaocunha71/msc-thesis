Explanation:
The problem asks to set all even bits of a given number. We can solve this by using bitwise operations. 

First, we convert the number to binary using the `bin()` function. This gives us a string that starts with '0b' to indicate it's a binary number. We remove these characters by slicing the string from the 2nd character onwards.

Next, we use the XOR operator (`^`) to set the even bits. We shift the number to the left by one bit using the `<<` operator, which effectively multiplies the number by 2. Then, we XOR the original number with the shifted number. This sets the even bits to 1 and leaves the odd bits unchanged.

Finally, we convert the binary string back to an integer using the `int()` function with base 2. This gives us the final result.

The unit test `assert even_bit_set_number(10) == 10` ensures that the function works correctly for the input 10, which has all even bits set. The expected output is 10, which is the original number with all even bits set.
