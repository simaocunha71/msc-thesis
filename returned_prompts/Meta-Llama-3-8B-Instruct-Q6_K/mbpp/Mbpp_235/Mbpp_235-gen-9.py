def even_bit_set_number(n):
    n = n | n >> 1
    return n
```
This problem is asking to write a function that sets all even bits of a given number. The even bits are the bits at the even indices (0-based indexing). 

The unit test `assert even_bit_set_number(10) == 10` suggests that we are allowed to modify the input number itself. 

The solution uses the bitwise OR operator `|`. The expression `n | n >> 1` sets all even bits of `n`. The `n >> 1` expression shifts the bits of `n` to the right by one position, which is equivalent to dividing `n` by 2. The `|` operator then performs a bitwise OR operation between `n` and `n >> 1`, which sets all the bits that are 1 in either `n` or `n >> 1` to 1. Since `n >> 1` has all the odd bits set to 1, the result is `n` with all even bits set to 1. 

The function returns the modified number. 

The time complexity of this solution is O(1) because it involves a constant number of operations, and the space complexity is O(1) because it uses a constant amount of space.
