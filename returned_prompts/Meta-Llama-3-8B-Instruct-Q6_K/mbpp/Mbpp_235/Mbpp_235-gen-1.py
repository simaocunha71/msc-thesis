The problem is asking to write a function that sets all even bits of a given number. However, it's important to note that the problem doesn't specify what to do with the odd bits. 

Thanks to the provided unit test `assert even_bit_set_number(10) == 10`, we can infer that the odd bits should not be changed. This means the function will set all even bits to 1 and leave the odd bits unchanged.

Here is the Python function that solves the problem:
```
def even_bit_set_number(n):
    return n | ((n >> 1) & 0xAAAAAAAA)
```
This function uses bitwise operations to set all even bits of the given number. The expression `n >> 1` shifts the bits of `n` to the right by one position, effectively dividing the number by 2. The expression `& 0xAAAAAAAA` is a mask that selects the even bits of the result. The `|` operator then combines the original number with the result of the mask operation, effectively setting all even bits to 1. The odd bits remain unchanged.
