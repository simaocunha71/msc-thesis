```
def check_min_heap(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i-1] > arr[i]:
            return False
    return True
```

This function iterates over the array, comparing each element with its parent. If the parent is greater than the child, the array is not a min heap. If no such pair is found, the array represents a min heap. The function returns `True` if the array is a min heap and `False` otherwise. The unit test `assert check_min_heap([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) == True` verifies that the function correctly identifies a min heap. 

Note that this function assumes that the input array is a complete binary tree, meaning that every level is fully occupied except possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right. If the array is not a complete binary tree, this function may not work correctly. 

Also, this function does not check if the root of the heap is the smallest element. It only checks the heap property, which states that for any given node I, if P(I) is the parent of node I, then the value of P(I) is always less than or equal to the value of I. If the root is not the smallest element, the array is not a min heap, but this function will still return `True`. To check if the root is the smallest element, you would need to modify the function to compare the root with the smallest element in the array. 

Here is a modified version of the function that checks if the root is the smallest element:
```
def check_min_heap(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    if arr[0] > min(arr):
        return False
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i-1] > arr[i]:
            return False
    return True
``` 
This function first checks if the root is the smallest element by comparing it with the smallest element in the array. If the root is not the smallest element, the function returns `False`. If the root is the smallest element, the function then checks the heap property by iterating over the array and comparing each element with its parent. If the heap property is not satisfied, the function returns `False`. If the heap property is satisfied, the function returns `True`. 

This modified function is more comprehensive than the original function, but it is also more complex and
