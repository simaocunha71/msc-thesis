def check_min_heap(arr):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(arr)):
            if arr[i] > arr[j]:
                return False
    return True
```
This function checks if the given array represents a min heap by iterating through the array and comparing each element with its right child. If any element is greater than its right child, it returns False, indicating that the array is not a min heap. If it iterates through the entire array without finding any such pair, it returns True, indicating that the array is a min heap.

The unit test `assert check_min_heap([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) == True` helps to clarify the problem by providing an example of an array that represents a min heap. The function should return True for this array, indicating that it is a valid min heap.

The time complexity of this function is O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the array, because it uses a nested loop to iterate through the array. The space complexity is O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the array and the loop indices.
