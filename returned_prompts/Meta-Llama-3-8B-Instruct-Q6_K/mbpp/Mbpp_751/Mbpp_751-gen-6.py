```
def check_min_heap(arr):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if i*2+1 < len(arr) and arr[i*2+1] < arr[i]:
            return False
    return True
```


This function checks if the given array represents a min heap by iterating over each element in the array. For each element, it checks if its left child (if it exists) is less than the element. If it finds any such pair where the left child is less than the parent, it immediately returns False, indicating that the array does not represent a min heap.

If the function doesn't find any such pair, it returns True, indicating that the array represents a min heap. This solution assumes that the input array is a complete binary tree, which is a common assumption for heap-related problems.

The unit test `assert check_min_heap([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) == True` ensures that the function correctly identifies a min heap. However, it's worth noting that this test doesn't cover all possible edge cases, and the function may need additional checks or modifications to handle other scenarios. For example, what if the input array is empty? What if the input array is not a complete binary tree? These cases should be considered and handled accordingly.
