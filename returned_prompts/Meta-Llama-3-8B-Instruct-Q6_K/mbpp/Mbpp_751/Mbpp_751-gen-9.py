```
def check_min_heap(arr):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] > arr[(i-1)//2]:
            return False
    return True
```
The function `check_min_heap` takes an array as input and checks if it represents a min heap or not. A min heap is a binary tree where each node is smaller than its children. 

The function iterates through the array, for each node, it checks if it is smaller than its parent node. If it finds a node that is larger than its parent node, it returns False, indicating that the array does not represent a min heap. If it checks all nodes and does not find any that are larger than their parent nodes, it returns True, indicating that the array represents a min heap.

The unit test `assert check_min_heap([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) == True` checks if the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` represents a min heap. Since the array is a min heap, the function should return True. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the array, and a space complexity of O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the function's variables.
