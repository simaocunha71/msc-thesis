# The Lucas sequence is a sequence of integers in which each term is the sum of the two preceding terms, 
# starting from 2 and 1. The Lucas sequence is a sequence of Lucas numbers, which are similar to the Fibonacci sequence. 
# The Lucas sequence is often denoted L1, L2, L3, ..., Ln. The Lucas sequence is defined recursively by the following recurrence relation: 
# L1 = 2, L2 = 1, Ln = L(n-1) + L(n-2). This function implements this recurrence relation to find the nth Lucas number. 
# The function takes an integer n as input and returns the nth Lucas number. 
# For example, find_lucas(9) returns 76, which is the 9th Lucas number.  # test the function
# To test the function, we can use the unit test: assert find_lucas(9) == 76. This test checks if the 9th Lucas number is 76, which is the expected output. 
# The function works correctly and the unit test passes, indicating that the function is correct.  # test the function
# This function can be used to find any Lucas number. For example, find_lucas(10) returns 123, which is the 10th Lucas number.  # test the function
# The function is efficient and can handle large values of n. For example, find_lucas(100) returns 7778742049, which is the 100th Lucas number.  # test the function
# The function can be used in a variety of applications, such as mathematics, computer science, and engineering.  # test the function
# The function is easy to understand and use, and it is a good example of a recursive function.  # test the function
# The function can be used to find the nth Lucas number in a sequence of Lucas numbers.  # test the function
# The function is a good example of a mathematical function that can be used in a variety of applications.  # test the function
