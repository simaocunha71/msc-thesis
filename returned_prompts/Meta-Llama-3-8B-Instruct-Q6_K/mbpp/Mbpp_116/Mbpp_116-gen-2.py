The problem is asking you to write a function that takes a tuple of positive integers as input and returns a single integer. The single integer is the concatenation of the digits in the tuple. For example, if the input tuple is (1,2,3), the output should be 123.

Here's a Python solution for this problem:

```
def tuple_to_int(t):
    return int(''.join(map(str, t)))
```

This function works by first converting each integer in the tuple to a string using the map function. It then joins these strings together into a single string using the join function. Finally, it converts this string back into an integer using the int function.

The unit test `assert tuple_to_int((1,2,3))==123` ensures that the function works correctly for the input tuple (1,2,3) and returns the expected output 123. This test is run when you run the Python program, and if the function doesn't return the expected output, the test will fail, indicating that there's an error in the function.
