The problem is asking you to write a function that takes a tuple of positive integers and returns a single integer. The integers in the tuple should be concatenated together to form the final integer. For example, if the input tuple is (1,2,3), the output should be 123.

Here's a Python solution for the problem:

```
def tuple_to_int(t):
    return int(''.join(map(str, t)))
```

This function works by first converting each integer in the tuple to a string using the map function, then joining these strings together with the join function. The result is a string that is the concatenation of the input integers. The int function is then used to convert this string back into an integer.

For example, if you call tuple_to_int((1,2,3)), the function will return 123. This is because '1'+'2'+'3' is equal to '123', and int('123') is equal to 123. This solution passes the given unit test:

```
assert tuple_to_int((1,2,3))==123
```
