The problem asks to write a function that takes a tuple of positive integers as input and returns a single integer. The single integer is formed by concatenating the strings of the input tuple.

For example, if the input tuple is (1, 2, 3), the function should return 123. This is confirmed by the unit test `assert tuple_to_int((1,2,3))==123`.

Here is the Python solution for the problem:

```
def tuple_to_int(t):
    return int(''.join(map(str, t)))
```



This function uses the `join` method to concatenate the strings in the tuple, and the `map` function to convert each integer in the tuple to a string. The `int` function is then used to convert the resulting string to an integer.
