def check_type(t):
    t = set(t)
    return all(type(x) == type(t[0]) for x in t)
```


The function `check_type(t)` takes a tuple `t` as input and checks if all the elements in the tuple have the same data type. It returns `True` if the elements have the same type, and `False` otherwise.

The function first converts the tuple `t` into a set `s` to remove duplicate elements. Then, it uses the `all` function to check if the type of each element in the set is the same as the type of the first element in the set. The `all` function returns `True` if all elements in the iterable are true, and `False` otherwise.

For example, the tuple `(5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6)` has the same data type for all its elements, so the function `check_type((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6))` returns `True`. Similarly, the tuple `(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)` also has the same data type for all its elements, so the function `check_type((1, 2, 3, 4, 5))` returns `True`. However, the tuple `(1, 2, '3', 4, 5)` has different data types for its elements (integer and string), so the function `check_type((1, 2, '3', 4, 5))` returns `False`.
