def check_type(tup):
    return len(set(type(i) for i in tup)) == 1
```


This function works by creating a set of the types of all the elements in the tuple. If all elements are of the same type, the set will contain only one type. Then it checks if the size of this set is 1. If it is, it means all elements have the same type, so the function returns True. If the size of the set is not 1, it means there are different types, so the function returns False.  



For example, the function check_type((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6)) returns True because all elements in this tuple are integers.  



Note: The unit test provided in the problem, `assert check_type((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6) ) == True`, confirms that the function should return True for this tuple, which is an integer tuple.  



The unit test `assert check_type((5, 'a', 'b') ) == False` can also be used to test this function. It should return False because the tuple contains both integers and strings.  



This function is case-sensitive. If you want to ignore the case of the types, you can convert the types to lower case or upper case before putting them in the set.  



The function does not raise any exceptions if the input is not a tuple. It simply returns False in this case, assuming that all elements in the input are of the same type. If you want to raise an exception in this case, you can add a check at the beginning of the function.  



The function does not check if the input is empty. If you want to raise an exception if the input is empty, you can add a check at the beginning of the function.  



The function works for tuples of any length, not just tuples with a small number of elements.  



The function works for tuples that contain any type of elements, not just integers and strings.  



The function works for tuples that contain any type of elements, including None, lists, dictionaries, etc.  



The function works for tuples that contain any type of elements, including user-defined classes.  



The function works for tuples that contain any type of elements, including complex numbers.  



The function works for tuples that contain any type of elements, including sets.
