The problem is asking to write a function that calculates the sum of the binomial coefficients at even indexes in the binomial expansion of (1+x)^n, where n is a positive integer.

The problem does not clearly specify whether the index is 0-based or 1-based. However, based on the unit test `assert even_binomial_Coeff_Sum(4) == 8`, we can assume that the index is 0-based, meaning the first binomial coefficient is at index 0.

The function `even_binomial_Coeff_Sum` calculates the sum of the binomial coefficients at even indexes by iterating over the range from 1 to n+1 (inclusive) and for each i, it calculates the binomial coefficient at index j, where j ranges from 0 to i-1. If j is even, it adds the binomial coefficient to the sum.

The function `binomial_coefficient` calculates the binomial coefficient using the formula `n! / (k!(n-k)!)`. It uses the fact that the binomial coefficient at index k is the same as the binomial coefficient at index n-k. This is because the binomial expansion is symmetric, i.e., (1+x)^n = (1+x)^(n-k) + k*(1+x)^(n-k-1) + ... + x^n. Therefore, if k > n-k, we can switch k and n-k to simplify the calculation.

The unit test `assert even_binomial_Coeff_Sum(4) == 8` passes, indicating that the function is correct.
