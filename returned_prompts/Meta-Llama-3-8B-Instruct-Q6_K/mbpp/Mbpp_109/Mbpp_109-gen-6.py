The function takes a binary string and an integer as inputs. It rotates the binary string `n` times by toggling each bit. Then it counts the number of '1's in the resulting string, which represents the number of numbers with an odd value when rotated `n` times. The function returns this count. The unit test `assert odd_Equivalent("011001",6) == 3` ensures that the function works correctly.  For example, the binary string "011001" rotated 6 times becomes "101010" which has 3 '1's.   Therefore, the function returns 3.  The function uses a loop to rotate the string `n` times and then another loop to count the number of '1's in the resulting string.  The time complexity is O(n), where `n` is the number of rotations, and the space complexity is O(1), which means the space usage does not change with the size of the input.   The function can be optimized by using a single loop to both rotate the string and count the number of '1's, but this would make the code more complex and harder to understand.   The current implementation is easy to understand and works correctly, so it is a good solution for this problem.  The function also handles the case where `n` is 0, which means the string is not rotated, and returns the count of '1's in the original string.  This is a correct result because the problem statement considers the case where `n` is 0.  The function can be further optimized by using a bit manipulation trick to count the number of '1's, but this would make the code more complex and harder to understand.   The current implementation is easy to understand and works correctly, so it is a good solution for this problem.  The function also handles the case where the input string is empty, which is a valid input for this problem.  The function returns 0 in this case, which is a correct result because there are no numbers with an odd value when
