```
def count_X(t, element):
    return t.count(element)
```





The problem is asking you to create a function that takes a tuple and an element as input, and returns the number of times the element appears in the tuple.

The unit test provided, `assert count_X((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2),4) == 0`, helps to clarify the problem. It shows that the function should return 0 for the given tuple and element 4, because 4 does not appear in the tuple.

Here is a simple solution using Python's built-in `count` method:
```
def count_X(t, element):
    return t.count(element)
```
This function takes a tuple `t` and an element `element` as input, and returns the number of times `element` appears in `t`. The `count` method returns the number of occurrences of the specified element in the tuple. If the element is not found in the tuple, the method returns 0.
