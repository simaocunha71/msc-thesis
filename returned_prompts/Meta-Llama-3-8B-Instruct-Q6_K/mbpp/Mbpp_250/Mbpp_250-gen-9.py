```
def count_X(tup, element):
    return tup.count(element)
```



The problem is asking to create a function that takes a tuple and an element as input, and returns the number of times the element appears in the tuple.

The unit test provided is `assert count_X((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2),4) == 0`, which means the function should return 0 when the element 4 is not found in the tuple.

Here's the solution in Python:
```
def count_X(tup, element):
    return tup.count(element)
```
This function uses the built-in `count` method of Python tuples, which returns the number of occurrences of the specified element in the tuple. If the element is not found in the tuple, it will return 0.
