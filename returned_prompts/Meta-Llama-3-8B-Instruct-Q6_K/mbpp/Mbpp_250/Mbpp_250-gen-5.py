```
def count_X(t, element):
    return t.count(element)
```


The function `count_X` takes a tuple `t` and an element as input, and returns the count of the element in the tuple. The `count` method of the tuple class is used to achieve this. This function passes the given unit test. 

The unit test `assert count_X((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2),4) == 0` checks if the function correctly returns 0 when the element 4 is not present in the tuple.
