```
def count_X(tup, element):
    return tup.count(element)
```
The function `count_X` takes a tuple `tup` and an element as arguments. It uses the built-in `count` method of Python's tuple type to count the occurrences of the element in the tuple. The method returns the number of occurrences of the element in the tuple. The unit test `assert count_X((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2),4) == 0` checks that the function correctly returns 0 for a tuple that does not contain the element 4.
