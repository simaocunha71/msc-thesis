```
def count_X(t, x):
    return t.count(x)
```


This function takes in a tuple `t` and an element `x` and returns the number of times `x` appears in `t`. The `count` method of a tuple returns the number of occurrences of its argument in the tuple. If the element is not found in the tuple, the method returns 0.

For example, the unit test `assert count_X((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2),4) == 0` checks if the function correctly returns 0 when the element 4 is not found in the tuple. 

This function will work with any type of iterable, not just tuples. It also works with strings, lists, sets, etc. 

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the tuple, because the `count` method has to iterate over the entire tuple to find the occurrences of the element. The space complexity is O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the count and the element.
