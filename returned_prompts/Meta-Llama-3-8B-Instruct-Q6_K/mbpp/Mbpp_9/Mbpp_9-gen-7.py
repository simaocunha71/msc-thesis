```
def find_Rotations(s):
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if s == s[i:] + s[:i]:
            return i + 1
    return 0
```


Explanation:
This problem is asking to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string. 

The given unit test `assert find_Rotations("aaaa") == 1` suggests that the rotation should be done from the left. 

The approach is to iterate over the string and check if the string is equal to its rotation. If it is, then return the number of rotations. If not, then return 0. 

The rotation is done by slicing the string. For example, `s[i:]` gives the substring from index `i` to the end and `s[:i]` gives the substring from the start to index `i`. 

In the unit test, the string "aaaa" is rotated once to get the same string, so the function should return 1. 

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because we are iterating over the string once. The space complexity is O(1), which means the space required does not change with the size of the input string, so it is constant. 





```python
import re
def find_Rotations(s):
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if s == s[i:] + s[:i]:
            return i + 1
    return 0
```


Explanation:
The function `find_Rotations(s)` takes a string `s` as input and returns the minimum number of rotations required to get the same string. 

The function works by iterating over the string and checking if the string is equal to its rotation. If it is, then it returns the number of rotations. If not, then it returns 0.

The rotation is done by slicing the string. For example, `s[i:]` gives the substring from index `i` to the end and `s[:i]` gives the substring from the start to index `i`.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because we are iterating over the string once. The space complexity is O(1), which means the space required does not change with the size of the input string, so it is constant.
