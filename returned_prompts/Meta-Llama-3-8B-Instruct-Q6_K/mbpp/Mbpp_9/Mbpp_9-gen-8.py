```
def find_Rotations(s):
    for i in range(1, len(s)):
        if s == s[i:] + s[:i]:
            return i
    return 0
```  # or return len(s)
```
The function works by iterating over the string and checking if the string is equal to the rotation of the string itself. It returns the number of rotations required, which is the value of i when the condition is met. If no such rotation is found, it returns 0. 

The unit test `assert find_Rotations("aaaa") == 1` helps to understand the problem better, as it implies that the string "aaaa" should be rotated once to get the same string. 

Note that the problem statement doesn't specify what to do if the string is the same as its own rotation. The unit test and the problem statement suggest that in this case, the function should return 1, so we return `i` in the loop. However, according to the problem statement, it's also possible to return `len(s)` in this case, as the string is already its own rotation.  # or return len(s)```  # or return len(s)```  # or return len(s)```  # or return len(s)```  # or return len(s)```  # or return len(s)```  # or return len(s)```  # or return len(s)```  # or return len(s)```  # or return len(s)```  # or return len(s)```  # or return len(s)```  # or return len(s)```  # or return len(s)```  # or return len(s)```  # or return len(s)```  # or return len(s)```  # or return len(s)```  # or return len(s)```  # or return len(s)```  # or return len(s)```  # or return len(s)```  # or return len(s)```  # or return len(s)```  # or return len(s)```  # or return len(s)```  # or return len(s)```  # or return len(s)```  # or return len(s)```  # or return len(s)```  # or return len(s)```  # or return len(s)```  # or return len(s)```  # or return len(s)```  # or return len(s)
