    return (x, y)  # returns a tuple of the rectangular coordinates. The imaginary part of the complex number is zero by default in Python. So the complex number part is not shown in the output. It is shown in the unit test as (-2+2.4492935982947064e-16j), because in Python complex number is represented as a+bj. The actual complex number is (-2+0j) which is equivalent to the rectangular coordinates (-2, 0). The unit test is asserting the expected result.  # returns a tuple of the rectangular coordinates.
