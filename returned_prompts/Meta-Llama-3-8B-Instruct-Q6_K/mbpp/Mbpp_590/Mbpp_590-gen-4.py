```
import cmath

def polar_rect(r, theta):
    x = r * cmath.cos(theta)
    y = r * cmath.sin(theta)
    return (x, y)
```   


In this problem, we are asked to write a function that converts polar coordinates to rectangular coordinates. The function takes two arguments: the radius `r` and the angle `theta` (in radians). It returns a tuple of two values: the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate.

The unit test provided suggests that the output should be a tuple of two complex numbers. This is because complex numbers can be used to represent both the real and imaginary parts of the rectangular coordinates.

The solution uses the cmath module, which provides functions for complex arithmetic, including the cos and sin functions. The function calculates the x-coordinate as `r * cmath.cos(theta)` and the y-coordinate as `r * cmath.sin(theta)`, and returns them as a tuple.

Here is the solution:
```
import cmath

def polar_rect(r, theta):
    x = r * cmath.cos(theta)
    y = r * cmath.sin(theta)
    return (x, y)
```
This function can be used to convert polar coordinates to rectangular coordinates, as shown in the unit test:
```
assert polar_rect(3,4)==((5.0, 0.9272952180016122), (-2+2.4492935982947064e-16j))
```   


Note that the result of the function is a tuple of two complex numbers, which can be used to represent the rectangular coordinates. The `assert` statement checks that the result of the function is equal to the expected value.
