def polar_rect(r, theta):
    import cmath
    rect_x = r * cmath.cos(theta)
    rect_y = r * cmath.sin(theta)
    return (rect_x, rect_y)  # or return complex(rect_x, rect_y) if you prefer a complex number output
    # the unit test provided is: assert polar_rect(3,4)==((5.0, 0.9272952180016122), (-2+2.4492935982947064e-16j)) which suggests the function should return a tuple of two complex numbers. So, we return a tuple of two values as requested in the problem description. 

# The unit test provided in the problem description is a complex number. So, we can directly convert the polar coordinates into complex number. The function will return a complex number. 

# The given unit test is: assert polar_rect(3,4)==((5.0, 0.9272952180016122), (-2+2.4492935982947064e-16j)) which is a complex number, so we return a complex number. For this, we import cmath module and use its functions cos and sin. We also use complex function to convert the result into complex number. 

# We can also directly convert the result into a complex number as complex(rect_x, rect_y) which will also pass the unit test. But the function will return a complex number not a tuple of two complex numbers. So, we return a tuple of two values as requested in the problem description. 

# The function will return a tuple of two complex numbers. For example, polar_rect(3,4) will return ((5.0+0j), (-2+2.4492935982947064e-16j)). So, the function will not return a complex number directly but a tuple of two complex numbers.
