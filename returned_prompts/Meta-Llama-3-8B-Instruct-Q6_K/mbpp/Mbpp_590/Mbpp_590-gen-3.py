```
def polar_rect(r, theta):
    x = r * math.cos(theta)
    y = r * math.sin(theta)
    return (x, complex(x, y))
```


The function takes two parameters, r (radius) and theta (angle in radians), and returns the rectangular coordinates (x, y) where x is the real part and y is the imaginary part of the complex number.
The unit test `assert polar_rect(3,4)==((5.0, 0.9272952180016122), (-2+2.4492935982947064e-16j))` helps to clarify that the function should return the real and imaginary parts of the complex number separately. This can be achieved by using the complex number function from the math module. The result of the function is a tuple containing the real part and the imaginary part of the complex number. 

The function uses the formulas x = r * cos(theta) and y = r * sin(theta) to calculate the rectangular coordinates from the polar coordinates. The math module is used to get the trigonometric functions cos and sin. The complex function from the math module is used to create a complex number from the real and imaginary parts. 

The function is designed to work with any valid polar coordinates (r, theta) and returns the corresponding rectangular coordinates (x, y) in the form of a complex number. The unit test helps to ensure that the function works correctly for a specific set of input values. 





Note: The math module is not imported in the function. You need to add `import math` at the beginning of the function to use the math module.
