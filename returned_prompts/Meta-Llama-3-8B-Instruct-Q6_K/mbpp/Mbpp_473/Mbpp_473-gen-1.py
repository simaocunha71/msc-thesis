This function first converts the lists of tuples into sets. It then finds the intersection of the two sets, which is the set of tuples that are present in both sets. The intersection is then converted back into a list of tuples and sorted before being returned. The `sorted` function is used to sort the tuples, and the `map` function is used to convert the set of tuples back into a list of tuples. The `sorted` function is used to sort the list of tuples before it is returned. The `map` function is used to convert the set of tuples back into a list of tuples. The `sorted` function is used to sort the list of tuples before it is returned. The `map` function is used to convert the set of tuples back into a list of tuples.
