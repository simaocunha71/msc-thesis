def tuple_intersection(tuple_list1, tuple_list2):

# test the function
tuple_list1 = [(3, 4), (5, 6), (9, 10), (4, 5)]
tuple_list2 = [(5, 4), (3, 4), (6, 5), (9, 11)]

Note: 
This problem is asking you to find the intersection of two lists of tuples. The intersection of two sets is the set of elements which are common to both sets. In this case, it's the tuples that are present in both lists, regardless of their order. 

The unit test provided is a good example of this. The tuples `(4, 5)` and `(3, 4)` are present in both lists, but they are in different orders in the lists. The function should still return these tuples as part of the intersection.

The solution uses Python's built-in set data type and the `&` operator to find the intersection of the two sets of tuples. It then converts the resulting set back into a list of tuples and sorts each tuple before returning the result. 

This solution assumes that the tuples in the input lists are hashable, meaning they can be used as keys in a dictionary. This means that the tuples should contain immutable types, such as integers or strings, but not mutable types, such as lists or dictionaries. 

If the tuples in the input lists are not hashable, you would need to use a different approach to find the intersection, such as using a list comprehension to iterate over the tuples and check if they are present in both lists. 

Here is the modified code to handle this:

```Python
def tuple_intersection(tuple_list1, tuple_list2):
    intersection = [tuple(sorted(t1)) for t1 in tuple_list1 if tuple(sorted(t1)) in [tuple(sorted(t2)) for t2 in tuple_list2]]
    return tuple(intersection)
```
This code sorts each tuple before comparing it to the other tuples in the list, so it will work correctly even if the tuples are in different orders
