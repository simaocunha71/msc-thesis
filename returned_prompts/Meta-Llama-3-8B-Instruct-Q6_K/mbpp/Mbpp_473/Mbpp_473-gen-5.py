```
def tuple_intersection(tuple_list, other_tuple_list):
    set1 = set(tuple_list)
    set2 = set(other_tuple_list)
    intersection = set1 & set2
    return tuple(sorted(intersection))
```
The provided unit test indicates that the function should return a tuple of tuples, where each tuple contains the intersection of elements in the given tuple list and the other tuple list, and the order of the elements in the tuples does not matter. The provided solution uses Python's built-in set data structure to find the intersection of the two sets of tuples. The sorted function is used to sort the tuples in the intersection set, and the tuple function is used to convert the set of tuples back to a tuple. The resulting tuple contains the intersection of the elements in the given tuple list and the other tuple list.
