Explanation:
The problem is asking to write a function that finds the ratio of zeroes to non-zeroes in an array of integers. The ratio is calculated by dividing the count of zeroes by the total count of elements in the array.

The unit test provided helps to clarify the problem by giving an example of the expected output. The test checks if the ratio of zeroes to non-zeroes in the array [0, 1, 2, -1, -5, 6, 0, -3, -2, 3, 4, 6, 8] is close to 0.181818.

The solution is a simple function that iterates over the array, counts the number of zeroes, and then divides it by the total count of elements to get the ratio. The `math.isclose` function is used to check if the calculated ratio is close to the expected value. The `rel_tol` parameter is set to 0.001 to allow for a small tolerance in the comparison.
