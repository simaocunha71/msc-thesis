```
import math
def zero_count(nums):
    zeroes = sum(1 for num in nums if num == 0)
    non_zeroes = len(nums) - zeroes
    return zeroes / non_zeroes if non_zeroes > 0 else 0
```





The problem is asking you to write a function that calculates the ratio of zeroes to non-zeroes in an array of integers. 

The unit test provided suggests that the function should return a floating-point number. 

Here is a Python solution for the problem:

```
import math
def zero_count(nums):
    zeroes = sum(1 for num in nums if num == 0)
    non_zeroes = len(nums) - zeroes
    return zeroes / non_zeroes if non_zeroes > 0 else 0
```

This function works by first counting the number of zeroes in the array using a generator expression. It then calculates the number of non-zero elements by subtracting the count of zeroes from the total length of the array. Finally, it returns the ratio of zeroes to non-zeroes. If the array contains only zeroes, the function returns 0 to avoid a division by zero error. 

The `math.isclose` function from the unit test is used to verify that the ratio is close to the expected value within a certain tolerance. This is a common practice in numerical computations where exact equality may not be achievable due to floating-point precision issues.
