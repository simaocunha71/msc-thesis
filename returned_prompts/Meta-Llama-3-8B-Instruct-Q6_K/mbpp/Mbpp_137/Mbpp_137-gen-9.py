The function `zero_count` takes an array of integers as input and returns the ratio of zeroes to non-zeroes. It counts the number of zeroes and non-zeroes in the array and then calculates the ratio. If there are no non-zeroes in the array (i.e., all elements are zeroes), it returns 0. The unit test `assert math.isclose(zero_count([0, 1, 2, -1, -5, 6, 0, -3, -2, 3, 4, 6, 8]), 0.181818, rel_tol=0.001)` ensures that the function returns the correct result.  The `math.isclose` function is used to compare the result with the expected value with a relative tolerance of 0.001. This means that the actual result is considered equal to the expected result if the difference between them is less than or equal to 0.001 times the expected result.  For example, if the expected result is 0.1, the actual result is considered equal if it is between 0.099 and 0.101.  This is necessary because floating point arithmetic can sometimes produce small rounding errors.  The `rel_tol` parameter specifies the relative tolerance.  In this case, it is set to 0.001, which means that the actual result is considered equal if the difference between it and the expected result is less than or equal to 0.001 times the expected result.  If the expected result is 0.1, the actual result is considered equal if it is between 0.099 and 0.101.  The `math.isclose` function is a more flexible and robust way to compare floating point numbers than the simple equality test, because it takes into account the possibility of small rounding errors.  It is also more flexible because it allows the user to specify the relative tolerance.  For example, if the expected result is 0.1 and the actual result is 0.0999, the `math.isclose` function will consider them equal if the `rel_tol` parameter is set to 0.001, but the simple equality test will not.
