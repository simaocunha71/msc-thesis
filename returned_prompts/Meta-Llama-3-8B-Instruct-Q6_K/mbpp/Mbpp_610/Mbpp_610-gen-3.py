```
def remove_kth_element(lst, k):
    return lst[:k-1] + lst[k:]
```


Explanation:
The problem is asking to create a function that takes a list and an integer k as input, and returns a new list with the same elements as the original list, but the k'th element removed. 

In the given unit test, the list is `[1,1,2,3,4,4,5,1]` and the k'th element to be removed is the 3rd element, which is `2`. The expected output is `[1, 1, 3, 4, 4, 5, 1]`, which is the original list without the 3rd element.

The solution to this problem is to use Python's list slicing feature. The `lst[:k-1]` expression returns a new list that includes all elements from the beginning of the list up to, but not including, the k'th element. The `lst[k:]` expression returns a new list that includes all elements from the k'th element to the end of the list. By concatenating these two lists using the `+` operator, we effectively remove the k'th element from the original list. 

For example, if the input list is `[1,1,2,3,4,4,5,1]` and k is `3`, the function will return `[1, 1, 3, 4, 4, 5, 1]`, which is the expected output. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list, because it involves creating a new list. The space complexity is also O(n), because the function returns a new list that is potentially larger than the input list. 





```
def remove_kth_element(lst, k):
    return lst[:k-1] + lst[k:]
```


This function takes a list `lst` and an integer `k` as input, and returns a new list with the same elements as the original list, but the k'th element removed. The function uses Python's list slicing feature to create a new list that includes all elements from the beginning of the list up to, but not including, the k'th element, and all elements from the k'th element to the end of the list. The two lists are then concatenated using the `+` operator to create the new
