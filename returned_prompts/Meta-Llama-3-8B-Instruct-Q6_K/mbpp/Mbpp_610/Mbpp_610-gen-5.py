def remove_kth_element(lst, k):
    if k > len(lst):
        raise ValueError("k is larger than the length of the list")
    return lst[:k-1] + lst[k:]
```
This function works by slicing the list into two parts: the part before the k'th element, and the part after the k'th element. The k'th element itself is not included in either part. The result is a new list that contains all the elements of the original list, except for the k'th one.

The function also checks if k is larger than the length of the list, and raises a ValueError in that case, because it doesn't make sense to remove an element that doesn't exist. This is done to ensure the function behaves correctly in all cases. 

The unit test `assert remove_kth_element([1,1,2,3,4,4,5,1],3)==[1, 1, 3, 4, 4, 5, 1]` shows that the function should return a list with all the elements of the original list, except for the 3rd element (which is 2). The function passes this test, as expected.
