```
def surfacearea_cube(size):
    return 6 * (size ** 2)
```



The surface area of a cube can be calculated by multiplying the area of one face by the number of faces. The area of one face is the square of the size of the cube. So the surface area of a cube is 6 * (size ** 2). 

This is confirmed by the unit test `assert surfacearea_cube(5)==150`, which is the surface area of a cube with a size of 5. The surface area is 6 * (5 ** 2) = 6 * 25 = 150. 

The function `surfacearea_cube(size)` takes a size as input and returns the surface area of the cube. 

This function passes the given unit test.
