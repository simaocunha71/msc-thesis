```
def surfacearea_cube(size):
    return 6*size**2
```


This function calculates the surface area of a cube of a given size. The surface area of a cube is 6 times the square of the size of the cube. The unit test `assert surfacearea_cube(5)==150` ensures that the function is working correctly. It checks that the surface area of a cube of size 5 is 150, which is indeed the case. The function can be used with any size of cube to calculate its surface area. For example, `surfacearea_cube(10)` would return the surface area of a cube of size 10.
