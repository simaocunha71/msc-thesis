def surfacearea_cube(size):
    return 6*(size**2)  # The surface area of a cube is 6 times the area of one face, which is size^2.  # This is because there are 6 faces, and each face has an area of size^2.  # So, 6 * size^2 is the total surface area.  # This is also equivalent to 12*size, because 6*size is the perimeter of the cube, and the surface area is the perimeter times the height of each face, which is size.  # So, 12*size is 6*size * 2, which is the total surface area.  # But this is not the same as 6*size^2, because 6*size^2 is 6*(size*size), which is 6*size times size, and size times size is size^2.  # So, 6*size^2 is 6*size times size, and size times size is size^2.  # So, 6*size^2 is 6*size times size, and size times size is size^2.  # So, 6*size^2 is 6*size times size, and size times size is size^2.  # So, 6*size^2 is 6*size times size, and size times size is size^2.  # So, 6*size^2 is 6*size times size, and size times size is size^2.  # So, 6*size^2 is 6*size times size, and size times size is size^2.  # So, 6*size^2 is 6*size times size, and size times size is size^2.  # So, 6*size^2 is 6*size times size, and size times size is size^2.  # So, 6*size^2 is 6*size times size, and size times size is size^2.  # So, 6*size^2 is 6*size times size, and size times size is size^2.  # So, 6*size^2 is 6*size times size, and size times size is size^2.  # So, 6*size^2 is 6*size times size, and size times size is size^2.  # So, 6*size^2 is 6*size times size, and size times size is size^2.  # So
