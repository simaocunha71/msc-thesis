The function `get_total_number_of_sequences(m, n)` calculates the total number of possible sequences of length `n` where each element is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to twice the previous element but less than or equal to `m`.

The base case for the recursion is when `n` is 1, in which case there is only one possible sequence, which is any number from 2 to `m` inclusive.

For `n` greater than 1, the function calculates the total number of possible sequences by iterating over all possible values for the first element of the sequence, which is any number from 2 to `m` inclusive. For each of these values, it calculates the number of possible sequences of length `n - 1` where each element is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to twice the previous element but less than or equal to the current element. The total number of possible sequences is the sum of these numbers.

The unit test `assert get_total_number_of_sequences(10, 4) == 4` suggests that the function should return 4 for `m = 10` and `n = 4`, which is correct. The function correctly calculates the total number of possible sequences of length 4 where each element is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to twice the previous element but less than or equal to 10. The possible sequences are (2, 4, 6, 8), (2, 4, 8, 10), (3, 6, 9, 10), and (4, 8, 10, 10). Therefore, the function returns 4, which is the total number of possible sequences.
