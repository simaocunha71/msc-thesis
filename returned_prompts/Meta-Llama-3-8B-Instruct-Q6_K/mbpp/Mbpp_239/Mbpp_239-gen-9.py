The problem asks to find the number of possible sequences of length n, where each element is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to twice the previous element but less than or equal to m. 

The base case for the problem is when the sequence length is 1, in which case there is only one possible sequence. 

For the general case, the problem is equivalent to finding the number of sequences of length n-1, where each element is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to twice the previous element but less than or equal to m, and then adding the number of sequences of length n-1, where the first element is i (for each i from 2 to min(m, n*2)). 

This is because for a sequence of length n, the last element can be any number from 2 to min(m, n*2), and the rest of the sequence can be any sequence of length n-1. 

The unit test `assert get_total_number_of_sequences(10, 4) == 4` helps to clarify the problem by providing an example of the expected output. 

The function `get_total_number_of_sequences(m, n)` uses a recursive approach to solve the problem. It calculates the number of possible sequences for each possible first element, and then adds them up. The function returns the total count of possible sequences. 

Note that the function uses a recursive approach, which can be less efficient than an iterative approach for large inputs. However, for the given constraints, the recursive approach is sufficient. 

Also, the function assumes that the input integers m and n are positive. If this is not the case, the function may not work correctly. 

The time complexity of the function is O(min(m, n*2)^n), because in the worst case, the function needs to calculate the number of sequences for each possible first element. The space complexity is O(n), because the function uses a recursive approach and the maximum depth of the recursion tree is n.
