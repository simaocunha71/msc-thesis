```
def get_total_number_of_sequences(m, n):
    if n == 1:
        return m
    total = 0
    for i in range(2, m):
        total += get_total_number_of_sequences(i, n - 1)
    return total
```


The problem is asking to find the total number of possible sequences of length n, where each element is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to twice the previous element but less than or equal to m.

The given unit test `assert get_total_number_of_sequences(10, 4) == 4` helps to clarify the problem. It suggests that we need to find the total number of sequences, not the actual sequences themselves.

Here is the Python solution for the problem. It uses recursion to find the total number of sequences. The base case is when n is 1, in which case the total number of sequences is m. For n greater than 1, the total number of sequences is the sum of the total number of sequences for each possible value of the first element (from 2 to m-1), and the total number of sequences for the remaining elements (n-1). This is because each element is greater than or equal to twice the previous element.

The time complexity of this solution is O(m^(n-1)), because in the worst case, we need to calculate the total number of sequences for each possible value of the first element. The space complexity is O(n), because of the recursive call stack. However, this can be improved to O(1) by using dynamic programming.
