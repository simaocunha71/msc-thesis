The problem is asking to find the total number of possible sequences of length n, where each element is a positive integer greater than or equal to twice the previous element, and less than or equal to m.

The given unit test `assert get_total_number_of_sequences(10, 4) == 4` helps to clarify the problem. It suggests that the sequences are not necessarily distinct, and we are counting the total number of possible sequences.

Here's a Python solution for the problem:

The function `get_total_number_of_sequences` takes two arguments `m` and `n`. If `n` is 1, it returns `m` because there are `m` possible sequences of length 1 (each element can be any integer from 1 to `m`). If `n` is greater than 1, it recursively calls itself with `m // 2` and `n - 1`, and multiplies the result by `m`. This is because for each possible sequence of length `n - 1`, we can add any integer from 1 to `m` to the end, resulting in `m` possible sequences.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the sequence. This is because we are recursively calling the function n times. The space complexity is O(n) as well, because we are using a recursive call stack of size n.
