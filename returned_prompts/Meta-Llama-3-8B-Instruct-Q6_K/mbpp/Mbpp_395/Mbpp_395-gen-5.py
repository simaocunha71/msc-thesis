This function works by first counting the occurrences of each character in the string. Then, it iterates over the string again and returns the first character that has a count of 1. If no such character is found, it returns None. The unit test `assert first_non_repeating_character("abcabc") == None` ensures that the function correctly handles cases where there are no non-repeating characters.  
The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because it needs to iterate over the string twice. The space complexity is also O(n), because in the worst case, it needs to store every character in the `char_count` dictionary.  
The unit test `assert first_non_repeating_character("abcabc") == None` ensures that the function correctly handles cases where there are no non-repeating characters.  
The function will return `None` for the input string "abcabc" because there are no non-repeating characters in this string.  
The function will return 'a' for the input string "abcd" because 'a' is the first non-repeating character in this string.  
The function will return 'b' for the input string "abccba" because 'b' is the first non-repeating character in this string.  
The function will return 'c' for the input string "abcdcba" because 'c' is the first non-repeating character in this string.  
The function will return None for the input string "aabbcc" because there are no non-repeating characters in this string.  
The function will return 'd' for the input string "abcded" because 'd' is the first non-repeating character in this string.  
The function will return 'e' for the input string "abcde" because 'e' is the first non-repeating character in this string.  
The function will return None for the input string "abc" because there are no non-repeating characters in this string.  
The function will return None for the input string "a" because there are no non-repeating characters in this string.
