The function `first_non_repeating_character` takes a string `s` as an input. It first counts the frequency of each character in the string using a dictionary `char_count`. Then it iterates over the string again and returns the first character that has a count of 1. If no such character is found, it returns `None`. 

For example, for the input "abcabc", the function will return `None` because all characters are repeated. 

The unit test `assert first_non_repeating_character("abcabc") == None` ensures that the function returns `None` when all characters are repeated. 

This function has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string. 

Note: The problem statement does not specify whether the function should return the index of the first non-repeated character or the character itself. The solution provided returns the character itself. If the problem statement is changed to require the index of the first non-repeated character, the solution would need to be modified accordingly.

        else:

    for i in range(len(s)):
        if char_count[s[i]] == 1:
            return i
