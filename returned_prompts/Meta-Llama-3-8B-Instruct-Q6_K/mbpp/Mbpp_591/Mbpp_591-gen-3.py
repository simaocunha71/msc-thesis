```
def swap_List(lst):
    if len(lst) > 1:
        lst[0], lst[-1] = lst[-1], lst[0]
    return lst
```


The function takes a list as an argument, checks if the list has more than one element, and if so, swaps the first and last elements using tuple packing and unpacking. It then returns the modified list. The unit test provided ensures that the function works as expected. 

For example, if you call `swap_List([12, 35, 9, 56, 24])`, it returns `[24, 35, 9, 56, 12]`. If you call `swap_List([1])`, it returns `[1]` as there is no need to swap anything in this case. If you call `swap_List([])`, it returns `[]` as the function handles empty lists correctly. 

The function can be used to interchange the first and last elements in any list, not just lists of integers. It is a general-purpose function that works with lists of any type of elements. 

The time complexity of this function is O(1) because it only involves a constant number of operations, regardless of the size of the input list. The space complexity is also O(1) as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the swapped elements. 

This function is efficient, flexible, and easy to use, making it a great addition to any Python programmer's toolkit. 

This function can be used in a variety of scenarios, such as data processing, data analysis, and data manipulation. It can be used to swap the first and last elements in a list of numbers, strings, or any other type of elements. 

The function is also very easy to understand and use, making it a great choice for anyone who needs to swap the first and last elements in a list. 

In conclusion, this function is a powerful and flexible tool that can be used to swap the first and last elements in a list of any type of elements. It is efficient, easy to use, and can be used in a variety of scenarios. 

Here is the unit test provided:

```
assert swap_List([12, 35, 9, 56, 24]) == [24, 35, 9, 56, 12]
```


This unit test checks if the function `swap_List` works correctly by comparing its output with the expected output. The test passes if
