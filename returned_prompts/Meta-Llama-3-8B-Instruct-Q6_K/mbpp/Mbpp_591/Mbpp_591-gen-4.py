def swap_List(input_list):
    if len(input_list) > 1:
        input_list[0], input_list[-1] = input_list[-1], input_list[0]
    return input_list
```
This function takes a list as input and checks if the list has more than one element. If it does, it swaps the first and last elements of the list. The function then returns the modified list. The unit test `assert swap_List([12, 35, 9, 56, 24]) == [24, 35, 9, 56, 12]` ensures that the function works correctly. 

Note: Python's list is a mutable object, which means it can be modified in place. The line `input_list[0], input_list[-1] = input_list[-1], input_list[0]` is a tuple packing and unpacking, which swaps the values of the first and last elements in the list. This is a more efficient and Pythonic way to swap values in a list compared to creating a new list with the swapped elements.
