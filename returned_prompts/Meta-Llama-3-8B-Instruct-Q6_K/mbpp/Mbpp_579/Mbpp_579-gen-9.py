```
def find_dissimilar(t1, t2):
    return tuple(sorted([i for i in t1 + t2 if t1.count(i) != t2.count(i)]))
```



Solution:
```
def find_dissimilar(t1, t2):
    return tuple(sorted([i for i in t1 + t2 if t1.count(i) != t2.count(i)]))
```



Explanation:
The problem is asking to find the elements that are not common in both tuples. We can achieve this by finding the count of each element in both tuples and then adding the elements to the result if their counts are not equal.

The unit test provided is `assert find_dissimilar((3, 4, 5, 6), (5, 7, 4, 10)) == (3, 6, 7, 10)`, which suggests that the order of the elements in the result does not matter. Therefore, we can use a set to store the unique elements and then convert it to a list and sort it before converting it to a tuple.

The function `find_dissimilar` takes two tuples as input, `t1` and `t2`. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over the union of `t1` and `t2` and checks if the count of each element in `t1` is not equal to its count in `t2`. If the counts are not equal, the element is added to the result. The result is then sorted and converted to a tuple.

For example, if `t1 = (3, 4, 5, 6)` and `t2 = (5, 7, 4, 10)`, the function will return `(3, 6, 7, 10)`, which are the elements that are not common in both tuples.
