```
def find_dissimilar(t1, t2):
    return tuple([x for x in t1 + t2 if t1.count(x) != t2.count(x)])
```





The problem asks you to write a function that finds the dissimilar elements in two given tuples. 

The problem statement is not clear about what it means by "dissimilar elements". However, based on the provided unit test, it seems that "dissimilar elements" means the elements that are present in one tuple but not the other.

The unit test is `assert find_dissimilar((3, 4, 5, 6), (5, 7, 4, 10)) == (3, 6, 7, 10)`, which suggests that the function should return all elements that are present in either tuple but not in the other.

Here's a Python solution for the problem:

```
def find_dissimilar(t1, t2):
    return tuple([x for x in t1 + t2 if t1.count(x) != t2.count(x)])
```

This function works by concatenating the two tuples and then iterating over the combined tuple. For each element, it checks if the element is present in the same number of times in both tuples. If the element is present in different numbers of times, it's considered dissimilar and added to the result list. Finally, the result list is converted to a tuple and returned.
