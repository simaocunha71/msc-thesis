```
def find_dissimilar(t1, t2):
    return tuple(x for x in t1 + t2 if t1.count(x) != t2.count(x))
```


The given problem is asking to find the elements that are present in either of the tuples but not in both. The function `find_dissimilar` takes two tuples as input and returns a new tuple containing these dissimilar elements.

Here's how it works:

1. `t1 + t2` concatenates the two input tuples into a single tuple.
2. The generator expression `(x for x in t1 + t2 if t1.count(x) != t2.count(x))` iterates over each element in the concatenated tuple.
3. `t1.count(x) != t2.count(x)` checks if the count of the current element `x` in `t1` is not equal to its count in `t2`. This is because elements that are present in both tuples will have the same count in both.
4. The `tuple` function is used to convert the generator expression into a tuple, which is then returned as the result.

The provided unit test `assert find_dissimilar((3, 4, 5, 6), (5, 7, 4, 10)) == (3, 6, 7, 10)` helps to clarify the expected output of the function. It shows that the function should return a tuple containing all elements that are present in either of the input tuples but not in both. In this case, the result is `(3, 6, 7, 10)`, which are the elements that are present in either `(3, 4, 5, 6)` or `(5, 7, 4, 10)` but not in both.
