```
def find_dissimilar(t1, t2):
    set1 = set(t1)
    set2 = set(t2)
    dissimilar = (element for element in set1.union(set2) if element not in set1.intersection(set2))
    return tuple(sorted(dissimilar))
```


The function find_dissimilar takes two tuples t1 and t2 as input, converts them into sets, and then finds the elements that are in either set but not in both. It uses a generator expression to generate these elements and then converts them back into a tuple, sorting it for consistency. The unit test provided ensures that the function works correctly for the given example. 





The unit test:
```
assert find_dissimilar((3, 4, 5, 6), (5, 7, 4, 10)) == (3, 6, 7, 10)
```


This test checks that the function correctly identifies the dissimilar elements in the two input tuples. The expected output is a tuple containing the elements 3, 6, 7, and 10, which are the elements that are present in either tuple but not in both. The function passes this test if it returns the correct tuple. 





This function can be used to find the dissimilar elements in any two tuples, not just the specific example provided in the unit test. It is a general solution that works for any two input tuples.
