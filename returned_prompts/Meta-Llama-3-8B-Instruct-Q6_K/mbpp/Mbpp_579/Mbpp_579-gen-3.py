def find_dissimilar(t1, t2):
    return tuple(sorted(set(t1) ^ set(t2)))
```
The function `find_dissimilar` takes two tuples `t1` and `t2` as input. It converts the tuples into sets, finds the symmetric difference of the sets using the `^` operator, converts the result back to a tuple, and returns it. The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements that are in either of the sets but not in their intersection.

The unit test `assert find_dissimilar((3, 4, 5, 6), (5, 7, 4, 10)) == (3, 6, 7, 10)` ensures that the function works correctly. It checks if the output of the function is equal to the expected result.

The function is case-insensitive and does not consider the order of elements in the tuples. It returns a tuple of unique elements that are present in either of the input tuples but not in their intersection. If there are duplicate elements in the input tuples, they are treated as separate elements. For example, if the input tuples are `(1, 2, 2, 3)` and `(2, 2, 4, 5)`, the output will be `(1, 3, 4, 5)`.

The time complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the total number of elements in the input tuples. The space complexity is also O(n), as we need to store the result in a tuple. The function uses the `set` data structure to find the symmetric difference, which has an average time complexity of O(n) for the `^` operator. The `sorted` function has a time complexity of O(n log n), but it is used only once to convert the set to a tuple. Therefore, the overall time complexity of the function is O(n). The space complexity is O(n) because we need to store the result in a tuple.
