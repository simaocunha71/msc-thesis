```
def replace_blank(s, c):
    return s.replace(" ", c)
```
This function uses the `replace` method of the string, which replaces all occurrences of the first argument with the second argument. In this case, we replace all occurrences of blank space with the character `c`. The unit test `assert replace_blank("hello people",'@')==("hello@people")` shows that this function works correctly.  It replaces all blank spaces in the string "hello people" with '@', resulting in "hello@people". 
This function is case-sensitive and does not preserve the original string. If you want to preserve the original string and also handle uppercase and lowercase blank spaces, you would need to add additional logic.  For example, you could use the `translate` method to replace both lowercase and uppercase blank spaces with the character `c`. 
Here is an example of how you could do that:
```
def replace_blank(s, c):
    return s.translate(str.maketrans(" ", c)).translate(str.maketrans(" ", c).maketrans())
``` 
This function first replaces all lowercase blank spaces with the character `c`, then it replaces all uppercase blank spaces with the character `c`. This way, it handles both lowercase and uppercase blank spaces. 
However, please note that this approach is not recommended if the string contains other special characters that should not be replaced. The original function is simpler and works correctly for the given unit test. 
If you want to handle other special characters, you would need to add additional logic to the function.  For example, you could use a regular expression to replace all non-alphanumeric characters with the character `c`. 
Here is an example of how you could do that:
```
import re
def replace_blank(s, c):
    return re.sub(r'\W', c, s)
``` 
This function uses the `sub` method of the `re` module to replace all non-alphanumeric characters (which are matched by the regular expression `\W`) with the character `c`. This way, it handles all special characters. 
However, please note that this approach is more complex and may not be suitable for all cases. The original function is simpler and works correctly for the given unit test. 
In conclusion, the original function is the simplest and most straightforward way to replace blank spaces in a string with a character, but it may not handle all special characters. You would need to add additional logic to handle other special characters.
