The nth nonagonal number is the sum of the first n nonagonal numbers. The nth nonagonal number can be calculated using the formula n*(8n^2 - 8n + 3)/2.

Here is the Python function to calculate the nth nonagonal number:

```python
def is_nonagonal(n):
    return n*(8*n**2 - 8*n + 3)//2
```

This function takes an integer n as input and returns the nth nonagonal number. The `//` operator is used for integer division, which is used to ensure that the result is an integer.

The unit test `assert is_nonagonal(10) == 325` ensures that the function is working correctly. The 10th nonagonal number is indeed 325.  If the function was incorrect, this test would fail.  For example, if the function was calculating the nth triangular number instead of the nth nonagonal number, this test would fail.  This is a way to ensure that the function is correct.  It's always a good idea to write unit tests for your functions to ensure they are working correctly.  This can help catch errors and ensure that your functions are correct.  Without unit tests, it can be difficult to catch errors and ensure that your functions are working correctly.  Unit tests can save you time and effort in the long run by helping you catch errors early and ensuring that your functions are correct.
