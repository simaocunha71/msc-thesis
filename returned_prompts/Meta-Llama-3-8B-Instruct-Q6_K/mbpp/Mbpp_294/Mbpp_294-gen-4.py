The problem is asking you to write a function that finds the maximum value in a given list. The list can contain different types of values, such as strings, integers, floats, etc.

The unit test `assert max_val(['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, 'version'])==5` suggests that the function should return the maximum integer value in the list, ignoring non-integer values.

Here's a Python solution using the built-in `max` function with a generator expression to filter out non-integer values:

```
def max_val(lst):
    return max(i for i in lst if isinstance(i, int))
```

This function works by iterating over each element in the list. If the element is an integer (checked using `isinstance(i, int)`), it is included in the generator expression. The `max` function then returns the largest integer value from this expression. If the list is empty or contains no integers, the function returns `None`.
