```
def volume_cube(side_length):
    return side_length ** 3
```





Python function to calculate the volume of a cube given its side length. This function takes one argument, the side length of the cube, and returns the volume of the cube. The volume of a cube is calculated by cubing the side length. This is because the volume of a cube is equal to the area of one side times the height of the cube, which is equal to the side length. The area of one side of the cube is the square of the side length. Therefore, the volume of the cube is the square of the side length times the side length, which is the cube of the side length. This is implemented in the function below:

```
def volume_cube(side_length):
    return side_length ** 3
```

This function can be tested with the following unit test:

```
assert volume_cube(3) == 27
```

This test ensures that the function correctly calculates the volume of a cube with a side length of 3, which is equal to 27. If the function is implemented correctly, this test will pass.
