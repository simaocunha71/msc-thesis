```
def volume_cube(side_length):
    return side_length ** 3
```


The problem is asking you to write a function that calculates the volume of a cube given its side length. 

The unit test `assert volume_cube(3)==27` suggests that the volume of a cube with side length 3 should be 27, which is the correct volume (3^3 = 27).

The formula to calculate the volume of a cube is side_length ** 3, so the function should return the cube of the side length. 

Here's the solution:
```
def volume_cube(side_length):
    return side_length ** 3
```


This function takes one argument, `side_length`, and returns the volume of a cube with that side length. The volume is calculated by raising the side length to the power of 3. 

For example, if you call `volume_cube(3)`, it will return `27`, which is the volume of a cube with side length 3. 
```python
print(volume_cube(3))  # Output: 27
```


This function should pass the given unit test. 
```python
assert volume_cube(3) == 27
```


It's a simple and efficient solution to the problem. 
```python
import math
def volume_cube(side_length):
    return side_length**3
```


You can also use the `math.pow` function to calculate the cube of the side length. 
```python
import math
def volume_cube(side_length):
    return math.pow(side_length, 3)
```


Both of these solutions will give the same result, but the first one is more concise and efficient. 
```python
print(volume_cube(3))  # Output: 27
```


This function can be used to calculate the volume of a cube with any given side length. 
```python
print(volume_cube(4))  # Output: 64
print(volume_cube(5))  # Output: 125
```


You can test it with different side lengths to see the correct volume calculations. 
```python
import math
def volume_cube(side_length):
    return math.pow(side_length, 3)
```


This function will work correctly for all positive real numbers, including integers, floating-point numbers, and decimal numbers. 
```python
print(volume_cube(3.5))  # Output: 42.875
print(volume_cube(-3))  # Output: -27
print
