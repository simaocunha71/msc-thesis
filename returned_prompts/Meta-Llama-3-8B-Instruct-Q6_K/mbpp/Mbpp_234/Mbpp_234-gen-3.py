```
def volume_cube(side_length):
    return side_length ** 3
```


This function calculates the volume of a cube given its side length. The volume of a cube is calculated by cubing the side length. The unit test `assert volume_cube(3)==27` ensures that the function works correctly for a cube with a side length of 3, which has a volume of 27 cubic units. 

The function takes an integer as input, which represents the side length of the cube, and returns the volume of the cube as an integer. The function uses the exponentiation operator (`**`) to cube the side length, which is equivalent to raising the side length to the power of 3. 

For example, if the input is 3, the function will return 3 ** 3 = 27, which is the volume of a cube with a side length of 3. 

The function is simple and efficient, and it can be used to calculate the volume of any cube given its side length.
