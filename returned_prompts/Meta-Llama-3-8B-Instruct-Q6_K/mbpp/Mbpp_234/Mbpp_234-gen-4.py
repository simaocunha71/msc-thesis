```
def volume_cube(side_length):
    return side_length**3
```


This function takes the side length of a cube as an argument and returns its volume, which is calculated by cubing the side length. The unit test provided, `assert volume_cube(3)==27`, ensures that the function works correctly, as the volume of a cube with a side length of 3 is indeed 27. 

The unit test is used to validate the correctness of the function. The function is expected to return the volume of the cube for a given side length. In this case, the side length is 3, and the expected output is 27. If the function is correct, it should return 27 for the input 3. If not, the test will fail, indicating that there's an error in the function. 

The function is designed to be reusable and can be used to calculate the volume of any cube given its side length. It's a simple and efficient solution for this problem. 

The unit test is written in the assert statement, which checks if the output of the function is equal to the expected result. If the output is not equal to the expected result, the test will fail, indicating that there's an error in the function. 

The unit test is used to validate the correctness of the function and ensure that it works as expected. It's an essential part of the testing process and helps to identify errors and bugs in the code. 

The function is tested with the input 3, which is a valid side length for a cube. The expected output is 27, which is the volume of the cube with a side length of 3. The function is expected to return 27 for this input. If the function returns any other value, the test will fail, indicating that there's an error in the function. 

The unit test is used to ensure that the function works correctly for different inputs and edge cases. It's an important part of the testing process and helps to identify errors and bugs in the code.
