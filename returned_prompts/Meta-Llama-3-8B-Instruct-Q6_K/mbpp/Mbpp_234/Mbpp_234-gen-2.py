```
def volume_cube(side_length):
    return side_length ** 3
```


The problem is asking to write a function that calculates the volume of a cube given its side length. The formula to calculate the volume of a cube is side length cubed (side_length ** 3).

The unit test provided is `assert volume_cube(3)==27`, which means the function should return 27 when the side length of the cube is 3. This test helps to clarify the expected output of the function.

The solution is a simple function that takes the side length as input and returns the volume of the cube, which is calculated by raising the side length to the power of 3. This function can be used to find the volume of a cube given its side length.
