```
def volume_cube(side_length):
    return side_length ** 3
```


Explanation:
The function `volume_cube` takes a single argument `side_length` which is the length of the side of the cube. The volume of a cube is calculated by cubing the side length (`side_length ** 3`). This function is then tested using the unit test `assert volume_cube(3) == 27` which checks if the calculated volume of a cube with a side length of 3 is indeed 27, which is correct.
