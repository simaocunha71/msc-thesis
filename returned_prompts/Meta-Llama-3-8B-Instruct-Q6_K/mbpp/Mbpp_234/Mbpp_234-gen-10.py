def volume_cube(side_length):
    return side_length ** 3
```
This function takes a side length as input and returns the volume of the cube. The volume of a cube is calculated by cubing the side length. The unit test `assert volume_cube(3)==27` ensures that the function works correctly for a cube with a side length of 3.  This test checks that the function returns 27, which is the volume of a cube with a side length of 3 (since 3^3 = 27).  If the function is correct, this test will pass, otherwise, it will fail.  This is a basic way to test the correctness of a function.  In a real-world scenario, you would want to test the function with a variety of inputs to ensure it works correctly in all cases.  In this case, you could add more unit tests to test the function with different inputs.  For example, you could test the function with a cube with a side length of 4, or a cube with a side length of 0.5, etc.  This would ensure that the function is correct for all possible inputs.  The unit test `assert volume_cube(3)==27` is a simple way to test the function, but it is not enough to guarantee that the function is correct for all possible inputs.  You would need to add more tests to ensure the function is correct for all possible inputs.
