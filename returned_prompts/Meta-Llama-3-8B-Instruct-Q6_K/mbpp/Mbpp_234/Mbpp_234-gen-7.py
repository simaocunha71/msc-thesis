def volume_cube(side_length):
    return side_length ** 3
```
The function `volume_cube` takes a side length as an input and returns the volume of the cube. The volume of a cube is calculated by cubing the side length. In this case, the unit test `assert volume_cube(3)==27` confirms that the function is working correctly. If the side length is 3, the function should return 27, which is the volume of a cube with a side length of 3.  This function will work for any positive integer side length.  If a negative integer is provided, it will return a negative volume, which is not physically meaningful.  However, the function is designed to work with any real number as input, not just integers.  If a non-integer is provided, it will return a non-integer volume, which is also physically meaningful.  For example, if the side length is 3.5, the function will return approximately 42.6561, which is the volume of a cube with a side length of 3.5.  This function does not handle non-numeric inputs, so if a string or a list is provided, it will raise an error.  However, this is not a problem in this specific case, as the problem statement does not specify what should happen with non-numeric inputs.  In a real-world application, you might want to add error handling to deal with non-numeric inputs.  For example, you could use a try-except block to catch and handle exceptions.  Here is an example of how you could do this:

```
def volume_cube(side_length):
    try:
        side_length = float(side_length)
        return side_length ** 3
    except ValueError:
        return "Error: Input must be a number"
```
This function will return an error message if a non-numeric input is provided.  It will also work correctly with decimal numbers, and will return a volume that is a decimal number.  It will also work correctly with negative numbers, and will return a negative volume.  However, it will not work correctly with complex numbers, and will raise an exception if a complex number is provided.  If you want to handle complex numbers, you would need to add additional error handling.  For example, you could use the `abs` function to get the absolute value of the complex number, and then calculate the volume using the absolute value.  However, this is not
