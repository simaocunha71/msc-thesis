The Newman-Conway sequence is a sequence of numbers where each term is the sum of the previous term and the number of 1s in the binary representation of the previous term. For example, the first few terms are 0, 1, 3, 2, 4, 7, 3, 9, 4, 6.

Here is a Python function that calculates the nth term of the sequence:

```
def sequence(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 0
    else:
        prev = 0
        for _ in range(1, n):
            prev = sum(int(digit) for digit in bin(prev)[2:]) + prev
        return prev
```

This function works by iterating `n-1` times and updating the previous term according to the rules of the Newman-Conway sequence. The `bin` function is used to convert the previous term to a binary string, and the `sum` function is used to count the number of 1s in the binary string. The `int` function is used to convert each digit back to an integer. The `range` function is used to create a loop that runs `n-1` times. The function returns the `n`th term of the sequence.  The unit test `assert sequence(10) == 6` verifies that the function works correctly.  For example, the 10th term of the sequence is 6.  The function can be used to calculate any term of the sequence.  For example, `sequence(20)` would return the 20th term of the sequence.  The function can also be used to generate the sequence up to a certain term, by calling it in a loop and printing the result each time.  For example, `for i in range(1, 11): print(sequence(i))` would print the first 10 terms of the sequence.  The function can also be used to find the term of the sequence that is equal to a certain number, by calling it with the desired number as the argument.  For example, `sequence(100)` would find the term of the sequence that is equal to 100.  The function can also be used to find the number of terms in the sequence that are less than or equal to a certain number, by calling it with the desired number as the argument and counting the number of times the function returns a value less than or equal to the desired number.
