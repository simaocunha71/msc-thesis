    return [sorted(sublist) for sublist in lst]  # Use list comprehension to sort each sublist. The built-in sorted function is used to sort each sublist. The sorted function returns a new sorted list from the elements of any sequence. It does not modify the original list. The result is a list of lists where each sublist is sorted.  # You can use the sorted function in a list comprehension to sort each sublist. This will return a list of lists where each sublist is sorted.  # Alternatively, you can use a for loop to iterate over the list of lists and sort each sublist. This will also return a list of lists where each sublist is sorted.  # You can also use the sorted function in a for loop to sort each sublist. This will also return a list of lists where each sublist is sorted.  # The sorted function can also be used with the join function to concatenate the sorted sublists into a single string. This will return a string where the sublists are concatenated in sorted order.  # The sorted function can also be used with the join function to concatenate the sorted sublists into a single string.
