```
def sort_sublists(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists]
```



The provided unit test `assert sort_sublists((["green", "orange"], ["black", "white"], ["white", "black", "orange"]))==[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]` helps to understand the problem better. It suggests that the task is to sort each sublist of strings in the given list of lists. The function should return a new list of lists where each sublist is a sorted version of the corresponding sublist in the input.

The solution is a simple list comprehension that uses the built-in `sorted` function to sort each sublist. The `sorted` function returns a new sorted list from the elements of any sequence. The `for` loop iterates over each sublist in the input list of lists and sorts it. The sorted sublists are then collected in a new list, which is the output of the function. 





Final Answer: The final answer is def sort_sublists(list_of_lists): return [sorted(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists]. I hope it is correct.
