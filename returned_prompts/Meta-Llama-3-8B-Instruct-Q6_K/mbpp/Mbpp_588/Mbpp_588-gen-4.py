Python function to find the difference between largest and smallest value in a given list. The function `big_diff` takes a list of numbers as input and returns the difference between the largest and smallest value in the list. The unit test `assert big_diff([1,2,3,4]) == 3` ensures that the function works correctly for a list of positive integers.
