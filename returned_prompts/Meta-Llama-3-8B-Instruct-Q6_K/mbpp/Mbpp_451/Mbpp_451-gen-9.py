def remove_whitespaces(s):

Python's `replace` method is a string method that returns a copy of the string where all occurrences of a substring are replaced with another substring. In this case, we're replacing all occurrences of a space character (`" "`) with an empty string (`""`), effectively removing all whitespaces from the string. The unit test `assert remove_whitespaces(' Google    Flutter ') == 'GoogleFlutter'` ensures that the function works correctly. 

When you run this function with the given test case, it will return `'GoogleFlutter'`, which passes the test. The function will work correctly for any string with whitespaces. For example, `remove_whitespaces('Hello   World!')` will return `'HelloWorld!'`. 

This function does not preserve the original string and returns a new string with the whitespaces removed. If you want to modify the original string in-place, you can use the `replace` method in-place by using the `inplace` parameter, like this: `s = s.replace(" ", "", 1)`. However, this will only replace the first occurrence of the substring, not all of them. If you want to remove all occurrences, it's better to create a new string as shown in the function above. 

Remember, strings in Python are immutable, so when you use `replace` or any other string method, you're actually creating a new string, not modifying the original one. If you want to modify the original string, you need to reassign the result back to the original variable.  For example, `s = s.replace(" ", "")` will modify the original string `s`.  However, in this case, the original string is not modified, because `replace` returns a new string and the original string remains unchanged. If you want to remove all whitespaces from the original string, you need to reassign the result back to the original variable, like this: `s = s.replace(" ", "")`.  After this, `s` will be the new string without whitespaces.  The original string remains unchanged.  So, the original string is not modified, a new string is created.  That's why we always return a new string in this function.  If you want to modify the original string, you can reassign the result back to the original variable.  However, this is not necessary in this case, because the function already returns a new
