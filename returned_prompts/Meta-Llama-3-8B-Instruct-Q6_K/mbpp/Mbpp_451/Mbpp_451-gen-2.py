```
def remove_whitespaces(s):
    return s.replace(" ", "")
```



The problem is asking to create a function that takes a string as input and returns the same string but with all the whitespaces removed. 

For example, if the input string is ' Google    Flutter ', the output should be 'GoogleFlutter'.

The unit test provided, `assert remove_whitespaces(' Google    Flutter ') == 'GoogleFlutter'`, helps to clarify the problem. It shows that the function should replace all the spaces in the string with nothing, effectively removing them.

Here is the solution in Python:
```
def remove_whitespaces(s):
    return s.replace(" ", "")
```
This function uses the `replace` method of the string, which replaces all occurrences of the specified character (in this case, a space) with the specified replacement (in this case, an empty string). The result is a string with all the spaces removed.
