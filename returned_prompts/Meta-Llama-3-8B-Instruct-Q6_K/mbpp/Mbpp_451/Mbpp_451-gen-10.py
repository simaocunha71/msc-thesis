```
def remove_whitespaces(s):
    return s.replace(' ', '')
```





This problem is asking you to create a function that takes a string as input and returns the same string but with all the whitespaces removed. 

The unit test provided suggests that the function should remove all the whitespaces from the input string. For example, the test `assert remove_whitespaces(' Google    Flutter ') == 'GoogleFlutter'` implies that the function should return `'GoogleFlutter'` when given the input `' Google    Flutter '`. 

The solution to this problem is to use the `replace` method of the string, which replaces all occurrences of a substring with another substring. In this case, we want to replace all occurrences of the whitespace character (`' '`) with an empty string (`''`). 

Here is the Python function that accomplishes this:

```
def remove_whitespaces(s):
    return s.replace(' ', '')
```

This function takes a string `s` as input, replaces all occurrences of the whitespace character with an empty string, and returns the resulting string. For example, if you call `remove_whitespaces(' Google    Flutter ')`, it will return `'GoogleFlutter'`.
