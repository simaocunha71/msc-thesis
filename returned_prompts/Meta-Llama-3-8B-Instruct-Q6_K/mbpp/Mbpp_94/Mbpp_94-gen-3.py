```
def index_minimum(tuples):
    return min(tuples, key=lambda x: x[1])[0]
```
The function takes a list of tuples as input and returns the first value of the tuple with the smallest second value. The `min` function is used with a `key` function that returns the second value of each tuple. The `min` function then returns the tuple with the smallest second value, and the function returns the first value of that tuple. For example, if the input is ` [('Rash', 143), ('Manjeet', 200), ('Varsha', 100)]`, the function will return `'Varsha'`. 
The unit test `assert index_minimum([('Rash', 143), ('Manjeet', 200), ('Varsha', 100)]) == 'Varsha'` ensures that the function works correctly. 
This function assumes that the list of tuples is not empty and that all tuples have at least two elements. If these assumptions are not valid, the function may not work correctly. 
The function is case sensitive, so it will treat 'Rash' and 'rash' as different values. If you want the function to be case insensitive, you can convert the values to lower case or upper case before comparing them. 
The function does not handle the case where the list of tuples is empty. If the list is empty, the function will raise a ValueError. If you want the function to handle the case where the list is empty, you can add a check at the beginning of the function to return a default value, such as None or an empty string. 
The function is not efficient for very large lists of tuples, because it needs to iterate over the entire list to find the tuple with the smallest second value. If you need to find the tuple with the smallest second value in a very large list, you may want to use a different data structure, such as a heap or a balanced binary search tree. 
The function is not thread safe, because it uses the `min` function, which is not thread safe. If you need to use this function in a multi-threaded program, you will need to use a thread safe alternative.
