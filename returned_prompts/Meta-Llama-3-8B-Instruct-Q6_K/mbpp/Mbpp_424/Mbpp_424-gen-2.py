def extract_rear(t):
    return [s[-1] for s in t]
```


This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string `s` in the tuple `t`. For each string, it extracts the last character using `s[-1]` and adds it to the list. The resulting list is then returned. 

For example, when called with the tuple `('Mers', 'for', 'Vers')`, the function returns `['s', 'r', 's']`, as expected.  The unit test `assert extract_rear(('Mers', 'for', 'Vers') ) == ['s', 'r', 's']` ensures this behavior.  If the function is implemented correctly, this test will pass.  If the function is not implemented correctly, this test will fail, indicating an error in the implementation.  This test provides a clear example of the expected output for the given input, allowing the function to be tested and verified.  This is a common practice in software development, as it helps ensure that the function behaves as expected and catches any errors or bugs.  It also allows for quick and easy testing of the function, making it easier to verify that the function is working correctly.  This is particularly useful when implementing a function that is complex or has many possible inputs and outputs.  In this case, the function is relatively simple, but the test provides a clear and concise way to verify its behavior.  This can be especially helpful when working with a team, as it provides a clear and consistent way to test and verify the function.  It also allows for easy debugging, as any errors or bugs can be quickly identified and fixed.  This is an important aspect of software development, as it helps ensure that the software is reliable, efficient, and effective.  It also helps to reduce the risk of errors and bugs, which can be costly and time-consuming to fix.  By using unit tests, developers can be confident that their software is working correctly and can focus on adding new features and improving performance.  This is a key part of the software development process, as it helps to ensure that the software is of high quality and meets the needs of its users.
