```
def extract_rear(tup):
    return [i[-1] for i in tup]
```



Explanation:
The problem asks to create a function that takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list of the last character of each string in the tuple.

The unit test provided helps to clarify the expected output: `assert extract_rear(('Mers', 'for', 'Vers') ) == ['s', 'r', 's']`. This indicates that the function should return a list of the last character of each string in the input tuple.

The solution uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input tuple and extract the last character of each string. The expression `i[-1]` is used to get the last character of each string `i`. The resulting list of last characters is then returned by the function. 





This solution passes the given unit test:
```
assert extract_rear(('Mers', 'for', 'Vers') ) == ['s', 'r', 's']
```





The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of strings in the input tuple, because it iterates over the tuple once. The space complexity is also O(n), because it creates a new list with the same number of elements as the input tuple.
