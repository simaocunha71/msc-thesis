```
def extract_rear(t):
    return [s[-1] for s in t]
```


The unit test `assert extract_rear(('Mers', 'for', 'Vers') ) == ['s', 'r', 's']` suggests that we need to extract the last character of each string in the tuple. 

We can use list comprehension to achieve this. The expression `s[-1]` gives the last character of each string, and the comprehension iterates over each string in the tuple. 

The result is a list of the last characters of each string in the tuple. 
For example, the last character of 'Mers' is 's', the last character of 'for' is 'r', and the last character of 'Vers' is 's'. 
So the output of `extract_rear(('Mers', 'for', 'Vers') )` is `['s', 'r', 's']`. 





Note: The function `extract_rear` is case sensitive. If you want the function to be case insensitive, you can convert the strings to lower case or upper case before extracting the last character. For example, `s[-1].lower()` or `s[-1].upper()`. 

However, based on the unit test provided, it seems that the function should be case sensitive. 

Also, the function does not handle the case where an empty string is in the tuple. Depending on the requirements, you might want to add a check for empty strings and handle them in some way. For example, you could return an empty list if an empty string is found. 

Here is the modified function that handles empty strings:

```
def extract_rear(t):
    result = []
    for s in t:
        if s:
            result.append(s[-1])
    return result
```


This function will return an empty list if an empty string is found in the tuple.
