def extract_rear(t):
    return [s[-1] for s in t]
```


The problem asks you to write a function that takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list of characters. Each character in the output list should be the last character of the corresponding string in the input tuple.

The unit test `assert extract_rear(('Mers', 'for', 'Vers') ) == ['s', 'r', 's']` helps to understand the problem better. It shows that the function should extract the last character of each string in the tuple and return them as a list.

The solution is a list comprehension that iterates over the input tuple and uses the indexing feature of Python strings to get the last character of each string. The `[-1]` indexing gets the last character of the string. The list comprehension then collects these characters into a list, which is the output of the function. 





Example:
```
print(extract_rear(('Mers', 'for', 'Vers') ) )  # Output: ['s', 'r', 's']
```


The function works by iterating over each string in the input tuple. For each string, it uses the indexing feature of Python strings to get the last character. The last character is then added to the output list. The function returns the output list, which contains the last character of each string in the input tuple. 





Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of strings in the input tuple. This is because the function iterates over each string in the tuple once. 





Space complexity: O(n), where n is the number of strings in the input tuple. This is because the function creates a list to store the last character of each string. The size of the list is equal to the number of strings in the input tuple. 





The function is efficient because it uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input tuple and get the last character of each string. This makes the function easy to read and understand, and it also makes it efficient in terms of time and space complexity. 





The function can be further optimized by using a generator expression instead of a list comprehension. This would make the function more memory-efficient, especially for large input tuples. However, the function would still have the same time complexity, O(n). 





Here is the optimized version of the function:
```
def extract_rear(t):
    return (s[-1] for s in t)
```
