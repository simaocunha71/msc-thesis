This problem asks to write a function to check whether a given matrix is a magic square. A magic square is a square matrix filled with distinct positive integers, where the sum of each row, column, and both diagonals is equal.

The provided unit test suggests that a magic square is a square matrix filled with distinct positive integers, where the sum of each row, column, and both diagonals is equal. The unit test is:
```
assert magic_square_test([[7, 12, 1, 14], [2, 13, 8, 11], [16, 3, 10, 5], [9, 6, 15, 4]])==True
```

Here is the solution:
```
def magic_square_test(matrix):
    sum_row = sum([sum(row) for row in matrix])
    sum_col = sum([sum([matrix[j][i] for j in range(len(matrix))]) for i in range(len(matrix[0]))])
    sum_diagonal1 = sum([matrix[i][i] for i in range(len(matrix))])
    sum_diagonal2 = sum([matrix[i][len(matrix)-i-1] for i in range(len(matrix))])
    return sum_row == sum_col and sum_row == sum_diagonal1 and sum_row == sum_diagonal2
```
This function calculates the sum of each row, column, and both diagonals of the matrix. If all these sums are equal, then the matrix is a magic square. The function returns `True` if the matrix is a magic square and `False` otherwise.
