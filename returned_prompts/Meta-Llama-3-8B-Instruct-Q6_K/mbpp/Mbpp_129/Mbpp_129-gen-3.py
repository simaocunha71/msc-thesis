This function checks whether the given matrix is a magic square. A magic square is a square matrix filled with distinct positive integers from 1 to n^2 such that each cell contains a number which is the sum of the numbers in the cells of the corresponding row, column, and main diagonal. The function returns True if the matrix is a magic square and False otherwise. It checks the rows, columns, and diagonals of the matrix to ensure they all have the same sum. If any of the sums are different, the function returns False. If all the sums are the same, the function returns True. The unit test provided checks whether the function correctly identifies a magic square. The test matrix is a magic square, so the function should return True. If the function is correct, it will return True for this test case. If the function is incorrect, it will return False. The unit test can be used to verify that the function is working correctly. If the function is not working correctly, the test will fail, indicating that the function needs to be fixed.
