The problem is asking to write a function that determines whether a given matrix is a magic square or not. A magic square is a square grid filled with distinct positive integers, where the sum of each row, column, and diagonal is equal to the same constant.

However, the problem does not specify what this constant should be. But based on the unit test provided, we can assume that the constant is the sum of all elements in the matrix. This means that the function should check if the sum of each row, column, and diagonal is equal to the sum of all elements in the matrix.

Here is the Python solution for the problem:

```
def magic_square_test(matrix):
    n = len(matrix)
    total_sum = sum(sum(row) for row in matrix)
    for i in range(n):
        row_sum = sum(matrix[i])
        col_sum = sum(matrix[j][i] for j in range(n))
        if row_sum != total_sum or col_sum != total_sum:
            return False
    diagonal1_sum = sum(matrix[i][i] for i in range(n))
    diagonal2_sum = sum(matrix[i][n-i-1] for i in range(n))
    if diagonal1_sum != total_sum or diagonal2_sum != total_sum:
        return False
    return True
```

This function works by first calculating the total sum of all elements in the matrix. Then it checks if the sum of each row, column, and diagonal is equal to the total sum. If any of these sums is not equal to the total sum, the function returns False, indicating that the matrix is not a magic square. If all sums are equal to the total sum, the function returns True, indicating that the matrix is a magic square.
