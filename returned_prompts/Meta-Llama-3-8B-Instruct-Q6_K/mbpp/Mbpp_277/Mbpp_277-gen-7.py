def dict_filter(d, n):
    return {k: v for k, v in d.items() if v >= n}
```
The function `dict_filter` takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n` as inputs. It returns a new dictionary that includes only the key-value pairs from the original dictionary where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. The `items()` method is used to iterate over the key-value pairs of the dictionary, and the dictionary comprehension is used to create the new dictionary. The condition `v >= n` is used to filter the key-value pairs. 

The unit test `assert dict_filter({'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Kierra Gentry': 165, 'Pierre Cox': 190},170)=={'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Pierre Cox': 190}` ensures that the function correctly filters the dictionary to include only the entries with values greater than or equal to `170`. The expected output is `{'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Pierre Cox': 190}`, which is the dictionary with only the entries where the value is greater than or equal to `170`. 

This function can be used to filter a dictionary based on a specific condition, and it can be applied to any dictionary and integer value.
