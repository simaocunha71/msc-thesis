```
def dict_filter(d, n):
    return {k: v for k, v in d.items() if v >= n}
```
This function uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary that only includes the key-value pairs from the original dictionary where the value is greater than or equal to n. The `items()` method is used to iterate over the key-value pairs in the dictionary, and the `if` condition is used to filter out any pairs where the value is less than n. The resulting dictionary is then returned. 

For example, if we call `dict_filter({'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Kierra Gentry': 165, 'Pierre Cox': 190}, 170)`, the function will return `{'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Pierre Cox': 190}`, which only includes the key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to 170. 

The unit test `assert dict_filter({'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Kierra Gentry': 165, 'Pierre Cox': 190},170)=={'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Pierre Cox': 190}` ensures that the function behaves correctly in this scenario. 





Note: The problem statement is slightly unclear, but based on the provided unit test, it seems that the function should return a new dictionary that only includes the key-value pairs from the original dictionary where the value is greater than or equal to n. If this is not the intended behavior, please clarify the problem statement.
