    return {key: value for key, value in d.items() if value >= n}
```
This function uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary that only includes the key-value pairs from the original dictionary where the value is greater than or equal to the given integer n. The `items()` method is used to iterate over the key-value pairs in the dictionary, and the `if` statement is used to filter out the pairs that do not meet the condition. The resulting dictionary is then returned.  The unit test `assert dict_filter({'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Kierra Gentry': 165, 'Pierre Cox': 190},170)=={'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Pierre Cox': 190}` ensures that the function works correctly.  For example, it checks that the function returns a dictionary with only the entries for 'Cierra Vega', 'Alden Cantrell', and 'Pierre Cox' when given the dictionary `{'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Kierra Gentry': 165, 'Pierre Cox': 190}` and the integer `170`.  The function passes this test, so it is a correct solution to the problem.  It is also a good practice to use unit tests to ensure that the function works correctly with different inputs.  In this case, the unit test helps to ensure that the function correctly filters out the entry for 'Kierra Gentry' because her height is less than 170.  The function also correctly includes the entries for 'Cierra Vega', 'Alden Cantrell', and 'Pierre Cox' because their heights are greater than or equal to 170.  This shows that the function is working correctly and is a good solution to the problem.  It is also a good practice to use descriptive variable names, such as `key` and `value`, to make the code easier to read and understand.  In this case, using `key` and `value` as variable names makes it clear what the dictionary comprehension is doing and makes the code easier to read and understand.  It is also a good practice to use a consistent coding style throughout the code, such as using four spaces for indentation and using a consistent naming convention.  In this case, the code uses four spaces for indentation and
