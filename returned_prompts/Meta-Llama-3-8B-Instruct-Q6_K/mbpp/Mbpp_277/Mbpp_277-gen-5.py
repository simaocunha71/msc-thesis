The problem is asking to create a function that takes a dictionary and an integer as input, and returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from the original dictionary where the value is greater than or equal to the given integer.

The unit test provided helps to clarify the expected behavior of the function. It shows that the function should return a new dictionary with the same keys as the original dictionary, but only including the values that are greater than or equal to the given integer.

The solution uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary that meets the specified condition. The comprehension iterates over the key-value pairs in the original dictionary, and only includes the pairs where the value is greater than or equal to the given integer. The resulting dictionary is then returned.
