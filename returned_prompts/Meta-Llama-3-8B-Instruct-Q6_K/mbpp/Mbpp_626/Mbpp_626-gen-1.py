This function calculates the area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle with a given radius. It first calculates the side of the triangle using the Pythagorean theorem. Then it calculates the semiperimeter and the height of the triangle using the formulae for the area of a triangle and the formula for the semiperimeter of a triangle. Finally, it calculates the area of the triangle using Heron's formula. If the radius is negative, the function returns None, and if the radius is zero, the function returns 0. 

The unit test `assert triangle_area(-1) == None` ensures that the function returns None for a negative radius. 

The unit test `assert triangle_area(0) == 0` ensures that the function returns 0 for a radius of 0. 

This function assumes that the input radius is a non-negative number. If the input radius is not a non-negative number, the function may not work correctly. 

The time complexity of this function is O(1), which means it runs in constant time. The space complexity is O(1), which means it uses constant space.
