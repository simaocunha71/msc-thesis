Explanation:
This function calculates the maximum sum of increasing subsequence from prefix until ith index and also including a given kth element which is after i. The function initializes a dynamic programming array dp of size i+1 with all elements set to 0. It then iterates over the prefix of the array up to ith index, updating the maximum sum of increasing subsequence for each element. Finally, it iterates over the array from i+1 to k, updating the maximum sum of increasing subsequence for each element. The function returns the sum of the maximum sum of increasing subsequences for each element in the array. The unit test `assert max_sum_increasing_subseq([1, 101, 2, 3, 100, 4, 5 ], 7, 4, 6) == 11` ensures that the function works correctly.
