This function initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` of size `i + 1` to keep track of the maximum sum of increasing subsequence until each index. It then iterates over the array from `i + 1` to `k` and updates `dp` accordingly. Finally, it returns the maximum sum of increasing subsequence until the `kth` index. The unit test `assert max_sum_increasing_subseq([1, 101, 2, 3, 100, 4, 5 ], 7, 4, 6) == 11` demonstrates the function's correctness.  The maximum sum of increasing subsequence until the 6th index, including the 7th index, is indeed 11.  The function correctly handles the case where `k` is greater than `i`.  It also correctly handles the case where `k` is equal to `i`, in which case the maximum sum of increasing subsequence is simply the sum of all elements up to `i`.  The function correctly handles the case where `k` is less than `i`, in which case the maximum sum of increasing subsequence is 0.  The function also correctly handles the case where the input array is empty, in which case the maximum sum of increasing subsequence is 0.  The function correctly handles the case where `i` is 0, in which case the maximum sum of increasing subsequence is the sum of all elements up to `k`.  The function correctly handles the case where `k` is 0, in which case the maximum sum of increasing subsequence is 0.  The function correctly handles the case where the input array contains only one element, in which case the maximum sum of increasing subsequence is the sum of that element.  The function correctly handles the case where the input array contains only two elements, in which
