```
def max_sum_increasing_subseq(arr, i, k, kth):
    max_sum = 0
    for j in range(i, k):
        if arr[j] < arr[kth]:
            max_sum = max(max_sum, arr[j] + max_sum_increasing_subseq(arr, j, k, kth))
    return max_sum
```
The problem is asking to find the maximum sum of increasing subsequence from the prefix of the array until the ith index and also including the kth element which is after i. The kth element is given as an input.

The function max_sum_increasing_subseq takes four parameters: the array, the index i, the index k, and the kth element. It initializes the maximum sum as 0 and then iterates from i to k. If the current element is less than the kth element, it updates the maximum sum by taking the maximum of the current maximum sum and the sum of the current element and the maximum sum of the increasing subsequence from the current element to the kth element.

The unit test provided is:
```
assert max_sum_increasing_subseq([1, 101, 2, 3, 100, 4, 5 ], 7, 4, 6) == 11
```
This test case checks if the function returns the correct maximum sum for the given array and indices. The array is [1, 101, 2, 3, 100, 4, 5], i is 7, k is 4, and kth is 6. The expected output is 11. The function should return 11 as the maximum sum of increasing subsequence from the prefix of the array until the 7th index and also including the 6th element. The increasing subsequence is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] which sums up to 11.
