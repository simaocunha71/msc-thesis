The problem is asking to find the maximum sum of an increasing subsequence from the prefix until the ith index, and also including the kth element which is after i. The subsequence should be increasing and the elements should be considered in the order they appear in the array.

The unit test `assert max_sum_increasing_subseq([1, 101, 2, 3, 100, 4, 5 ], 7, 4, 6) == 11` helps to clarify the problem by providing an example of the expected output.

The solution uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. It first calculates the maximum sum of increasing subsequences up to the ith index, and then extends this subsequence to include the kth element. The function returns the maximum sum of the subsequence including the kth element. The time complexity of the solution is O(k) and the space complexity is O(i).
