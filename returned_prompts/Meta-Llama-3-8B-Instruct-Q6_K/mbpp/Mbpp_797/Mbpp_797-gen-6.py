```
def sum_in_range(l, r):
    return sum(range(l, r + 1, 2))
```


Explanation:
The problem is asking to find the sum of all odd natural numbers within the range l and r. We can solve this problem by using the built-in function `range()` and `sum()` in Python.

The `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from `l` and ending at `r` (but not including `r`). The third argument to `range()` is the step size, which is set to `2` to generate only the odd numbers.

The `sum()` function then adds up all the numbers in the generated sequence.

The unit test `assert sum_in_range(2,5) == 8` ensures that our function works correctly. For example, the sum of all odd natural numbers in the range 2 to 5 is 2 + 4 = 8. 

So, the function `sum_in_range(l, r)` will return the sum of all odd natural numbers within the range `l` and `r`.
