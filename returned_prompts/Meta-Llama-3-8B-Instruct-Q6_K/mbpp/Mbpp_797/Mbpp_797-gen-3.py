```
def sum_in_range(l, r):
    return sum(i for i in range(l, r+1) if i % 2 != 0)
```
Explanation:
The problem is asking to find the sum of all odd natural numbers within the range l and r. We can use the built-in sum function and a generator expression to achieve this. The generator expression `i for i in range(l, r+1) if i % 2 != 0` iterates over the range from l to r (inclusive) and includes only the odd numbers by filtering out the even numbers using the condition `i % 2 != 0`. The sum function then adds up all these odd numbers and returns the result. The unit test `assert sum_in_range(2,5) == 8` ensures that the function is working correctly for the given range.
