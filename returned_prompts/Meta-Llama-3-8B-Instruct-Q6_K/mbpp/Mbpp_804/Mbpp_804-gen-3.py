```
def is_product_even(lst):
    product = 1
    for num in lst:
        product *= num
    return product % 2 == 0
```


The problem is asking to create a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns whether the product of these numbers is even or not. 

The unit test `assert is_product_even([1,2,3])` suggests that the function should return `True` if the product is even and `False` otherwise.

Here is the solution in Python:

The function `is_product_even` initializes a variable `product` to 1. Then it iterates over each number in the list, multiplying the `product` by the current number. Finally, it returns whether the `product` is even (i.e., whether it is divisible by 2) or not. The modulo operator `%` is used to find the remainder of the division of the `product` by 2. If the remainder is 0, the `product` is even. Otherwise, it is odd. 

The function uses a simple and efficient approach to calculate the product of the numbers in the list. It does not require any additional data structures or complex logic. 

The unit test `assert is_product_even([1,2,3])` should pass with this implementation, as the product of the numbers 1, 2, and 3 is 6, which is even.
