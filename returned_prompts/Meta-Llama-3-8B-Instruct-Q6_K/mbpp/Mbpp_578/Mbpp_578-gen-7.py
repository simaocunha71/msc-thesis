```
def interleave_lists(list1, list2, list3):
    return [x for pair in zip(list1, list2, list3) for x in pair]
```
The function uses the built-in `zip` function to group elements from the three lists into tuples, and then uses a list comprehension to flatten these tuples into a single list. This works because `zip` stops when the shortest input iterable is exhausted, so we don't need to worry about the lists being of different lengths. 

For example, if we call `interleave_lists([1,2,3,4,5,6,7],[10,20,30,40,50,60,70],[100,200,300,400,500,600,700])`, the `zip` function will group the elements as follows:
```
[(1, 10, 100), (2, 20, 200), (3, 30, 300), (4, 40, 400), (5, 50, 500), (6, 60, 600), (7, 70, 700)]
```
And then the list comprehension will flatten these tuples into a single list:
```
[1, 10, 100, 2, 20, 200, 3, 30, 300, 4, 40, 400, 5, 50, 500, 6, 60, 600, 7, 70, 700]
