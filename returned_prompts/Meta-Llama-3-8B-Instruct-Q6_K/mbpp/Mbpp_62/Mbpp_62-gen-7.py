```
def smallest_num(lst):
    return min(lst)
```
The above function will return the smallest number in the list. It uses the built-in `min` function in Python which returns the smallest item in an iterable or the smallest of two or more arguments. 

The unit test `assert smallest_num([10, 20, 1, 45, 99]) == 1` ensures that the function is working correctly. 

This function will work for any list of numbers and will return the smallest number in the list. 

For example, `smallest_num([10, 20, 1, 45, 99])` will return `1` which is the smallest number in the list.
