```
def smallest_num(lst):
    return min(lst)
```
Explanation: 
The problem is asking to write a function that finds the smallest number in a given list. 
The function should take a list of numbers as an argument and return the smallest number in the list.
In Python, the built-in `min()` function is used to find the smallest item in an iterable. 
So, the function `smallest_num(lst)` can be implemented as `return min(lst)`.
This function will work correctly for the given unit test `assert smallest_num([10, 20, 1, 45, 99]) == 1`. 
The test checks if the function returns the correct smallest number in the given list, which is 1. 
The function will return the correct result for any list of numbers. 
For example, if the input list is `[10, 20, 1, 45, 99]`, the function will return `1`, which is the smallest number in the list. 
Similarly, if the input list is `[-5, 0, 5, 10, 15]`, the function will return `-5`, which is the smallest number in the list. 
The function will work correctly for any list of numbers. 

Note: 
- The `min()` function returns the smallest item in an iterable or the smallest of two or more arguments.
- The `min()` function is a built-in function in Python.
- The function `smallest_num(lst)` can be implemented as `return min(lst)`.
- The function will work correctly for any list of numbers.
- The function will return the correct result for any list of numbers. 
- The function will return the smallest number in the list. 





This is the solution to the problem. It defines a function called `smallest_num` that takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the smallest number in the list. The function uses the built-in `min` function in Python to find the smallest number in the list. The unit test `assert smallest_num([10, 20, 1, 45, 99]) == 1` checks if the function returns the correct smallest number in the given list, which is 1. The function will work correctly for any list of numbers.
