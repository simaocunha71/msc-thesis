You can use the built-in `min` function in Python to find the smallest number in a list. Here is the function:
```
def smallest_num(lst):
    return min(lst)
```
The `min` function returns the smallest item in an iterable or the smallest of two or more arguments. In this case, it returns the smallest number in the list `lst`. 

The unit test `assert smallest_num([10, 20, 1, 45, 99]) == 1` confirms that the function is working correctly. It checks that the function returns `1` when given the list `[10, 20, 1, 45, 99]`. 

This function will work for any list of numbers, not just the one given in the unit test. It is a simple and efficient solution.
