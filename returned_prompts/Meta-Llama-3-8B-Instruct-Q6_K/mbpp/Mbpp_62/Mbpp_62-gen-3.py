```
def smallest_num(lst):
    return min(lst)
```
The problem is asking for a function that finds the smallest number in a given list. 

The unit test `assert smallest_num([10, 20, 1, 45, 99]) == 1` suggests that the function should return the smallest number in the list.

The built-in `min` function in Python can be used to achieve this. It returns the smallest item in an iterable or the smallest of two or more arguments.

Here is the solution: 
```
def smallest_num(lst):
    return min(lst)
```  This function takes a list `lst` as input and returns the smallest number in the list. The `min` function is used to find the smallest number. The unit test `assert smallest_num([10, 20, 1, 45, 99]) == 1` passes with this solution.  ```  This function is efficient because it uses the built-in `min` function which has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the number of elements in the list.  Therefore, the overall time complexity of this function is O(n).  The space complexity is O(1) as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the function's variables.  ```  This function can be used to find the smallest number in any list of numbers.  For example, `smallest_num([10, 20, 1, 45, 99])` returns `1`, which is the smallest number in the list.  ```  Note: The `min` function can also be used with a key function to find the smallest number based on a specific criterion. For example, `min(lst, key=abs)` returns the smallest absolute value in the list.  ```  This can be useful when the list contains both positive and negative numbers and you want to find the smallest number based on its absolute value.  ```  For example, `smallest_num([-10, -20, 1, 45, 99])` returns `-20`, which is the smallest absolute value in the list.  ```  The `min` function is a powerful tool in Python and can be used in a variety of situations to find the smallest or largest item in a list.  ```  It is also worth noting that the `min` function can be used with other types of iterable, such as strings or dictionaries, to find the smallest item based on a specific criterion.
