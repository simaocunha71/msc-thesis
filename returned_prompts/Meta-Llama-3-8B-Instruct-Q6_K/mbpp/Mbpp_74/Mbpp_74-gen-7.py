```
def is_samepatterns(patterns, sequence):
    return len(patterns) == len(sequence) and all(patterns[i] == sequence[i] for i in range(len(patterns)))
```



Here is the explanation of the code:

The function is_samepatterns takes two parameters: patterns and sequence. It checks if the length of the patterns list is equal to the length of the sequence list. If they are equal, it then checks if the elements at each index in the patterns list are equal to the elements at the same index in the sequence list. If all elements are equal, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

In the unit test, the function is called with the patterns ["red", "green", "green"] and the sequence ["a", "b", "b"]. The function correctly returns True because the length of the patterns list is equal to the length of the sequence list, and the elements at each index in the patterns list are equal to the elements at the same index in the sequence list.
