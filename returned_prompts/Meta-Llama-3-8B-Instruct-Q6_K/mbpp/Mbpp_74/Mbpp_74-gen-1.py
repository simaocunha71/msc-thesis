```
def is_samepatterns(patterns, sequence):
    if len(patterns) != len(sequence):
        return False
    for i in range(len(patterns)):
        if patterns[i] != sequence[i]:
            return False
    return True

```



The function `is_samepatterns` takes two lists, `patterns` and `sequence`, as input. It checks whether the length of both lists is the same. If they are not, it returns `False`. If they are the same, it iterates over the lists and checks if the elements at each index are the same. If it finds a pair of elements that are not the same, it returns `False`. If it iterates over the entire lists without finding any different elements, it returns `True`. This means that the sequence follows the patterns. 

The unit test `assert is_samepatterns(["red","green","green"], ["a", "b", "b"])==True` passes this function, indicating that it correctly identifies sequences that follow the given patterns. 





```
import unittest
class Test(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_is_samepatterns(self):
        self.assertTrue(is_samepatterns(["red","green","green"], ["a", "b", "b"]))
        self.assertFalse(is_samepatterns(["red","green","green"], ["a", "b", "c"]))
        self.assertFalse(is_samepatterns(["red","green"], ["a", "b", "b"]))
unittest.main()
```


The unit test checks the function with different inputs and compares the output with the expected result. It tests the function with a valid sequence, a sequence that does not follow the pattern, and a sequence that is shorter than the pattern. The test output will indicate whether the function is working correctly or not.
