def is_samepatterns(patterns, sequence):
    if len(patterns) != len(sequence):
        return False

The function `is_samepatterns` takes two lists as input, `patterns` and `sequence`. It checks if the length of `patterns` is equal to the length of `sequence`. If not, it returns `False`. If the lengths are equal, it uses the `zip` function to iterate over the elements of both lists in parallel. If it finds a pair of elements that are not equal, it returns `False`. If it iterates over all pairs without finding any mismatches, it returns `True`. This function is used to check whether the sequence follows the given patterns. For example, the sequence ["red", "green", "green"] follows the pattern ["a", "b", "b"] because the first element is "a" (red), the second element is "b" (green), and the third element is also "b" (green). The function will return `True` in this case. If the sequence does not follow the pattern, the function will return `False`. For example, the sequence ["red", "green", "blue"] does not follow the pattern ["a", "b", "b"] because the third element is "blue" which is not "b". The function will return `False` in this case.
