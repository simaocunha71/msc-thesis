```
def count_Pairs(lst, k):
    lst = set(lst)
    return sum(1 for i in lst for j in lst if i != j and j <= k)
```
This function works by first converting the list to a set, which removes any duplicate values. Then it uses a generator expression to iterate over the set and count the number of pairs where the elements are unequal and the second element is less than or equal to k.

The unit test `assert count_Pairs([1,2,1],3) == 2` ensures that the function works correctly by checking that it returns 2 for the input `[1,2,1]` and k=3. This is because the possible unordered pairs where both elements are unequal are `(1,2)` and `(2,1)`. 

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input list. This is because it needs to iterate over the list once to convert it to a set, and then it needs to iterate over the set again to count the pairs. The space complexity is also O(n), because it needs to store the set of unique elements. 

Note that the function does not count duplicate pairs. For example, if the input list is `[1,2,2]`, the function will count `(1,2)` and `(2,1)` as two different pairs, even though they are the same pair. If you want to count duplicate pairs as well, you can modify the function to use a different approach, such as using the `itertools.combinations` function.  """  # This line is unnecessary.
