The problem is asking to write a function that takes a list of integers and counts the number of possible unordered pairs where both elements are unequal. 

The unit test provided, `assert count_Pairs([1,2,1],3) == 2`, suggests that the function should take two parameters: the list of integers and the length of the list. It should count the number of pairs where both elements are unequal and return this count.

Here is a Python function that solves the problem:

```
def count_Pairs(lst, n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            if lst[i] != lst[j]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

This function works by iterating over the list and checking each pair of elements. If the elements are unequal, it increments the count. The function returns the total count at the end. 

Note that this function has a time complexity of O(n^2) because it uses two nested loops to iterate over the list. If the list is very large, this function may be slow. 

Also, this function does not handle the case where the list contains duplicate elements. If the list can contain duplicates, the function should be modified to skip over duplicate elements when checking for pairs. 

For example, if the list is `[1,2,2,3]`, the function should count the pairs `(1,2)` and `(1,3)` only once, not twice. This can be done by using a set to keep track of the elements that have already been seen. Here is the modified function:

```
def count_Pairs(lst, n):
    seen = set()
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            if lst[i] not in seen and lst[j] not in seen and lst[i] != lst[j]:
                count += 1
                seen.add(lst[i])
                seen.add(lst[j])
    return count
```  `

This modified function has a time complexity of O(n^2) as well, but it is more efficient than the original function because it uses a set to keep track of the elements that have already been seen. This reduces the number of comparisons it needs to make, especially when the list contains many duplicate elements.  `

The time complexity of this function is O(n^2) in the worst case, but it can be improved to
