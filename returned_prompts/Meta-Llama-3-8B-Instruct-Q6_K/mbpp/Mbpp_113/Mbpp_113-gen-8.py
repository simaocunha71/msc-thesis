```
def check_integer(s):
    try:
        int(s)
        return True
    except ValueError:
        return False
```


The unit test `assert check_integer("python")==False` indicates that the function should return `False` for a string that does not represent an integer. The function `check_integer(s)` tries to convert the input string `s` to an integer using `int(s)`. If the conversion is successful, it returns `True`. If a `ValueError` is raised, it means that the string cannot be converted to an integer, and the function returns `False`. 

The `try-except` block is used to catch the `ValueError` and handle it accordingly. This approach is more Pythonic and efficient than checking for the presence of non-digit characters in the string. It also allows for more flexibility in the input strings that can be checked. For example, it can handle strings that contain leading or trailing whitespace, or strings that contain decimal points or negative signs.
