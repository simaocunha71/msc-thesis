```
def check_integer(s):
    try:
        int(s)
        return True
    except ValueError:
        return False
```

The function `check_integer(s)` takes a string `s` as input. It tries to convert the string `s` into an integer using the `int(s)` function. If the conversion is successful, it means the string represents an integer and the function returns `True`. If the conversion raises a `ValueError` (which happens when the string cannot be converted into an integer), the function returns `False`. This function will work for strings like "123" and "0", but it will return `False` for strings like "python" or "abc". The unit test `assert check_integer("python")==False` ensures that this function works correctly.
