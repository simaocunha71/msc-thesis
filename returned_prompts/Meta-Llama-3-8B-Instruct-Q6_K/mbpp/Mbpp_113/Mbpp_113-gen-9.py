def check_integer(s):
    try:
        int(s)
        return True
    except ValueError:
        return False
```
Explanation:
The function `check_integer` takes a string `s` as input and returns `True` if the string represents an integer and `False` otherwise. It does this by trying to convert the string to an integer using the `int()` function. If the conversion is successful, the function returns `True`. If the conversion raises a `ValueError` (which it will if the string does not represent an integer), the function returns `False`. This approach works for any string that represents an integer, including strings that start with a negative sign, as well as strings that represent very large integers. The unit test `assert check_integer("python")==False` ensures that the function correctly returns `False` for a string that does not represent an integer.
