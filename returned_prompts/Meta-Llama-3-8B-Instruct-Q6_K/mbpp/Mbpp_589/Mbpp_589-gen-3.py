```
def perfect_squares(start, end):
    return [i**2 for i in range(int(start**0.5), int(end**0.5)+1) if start <= i**2 <= end]
```


The problem is asking to write a function that finds all perfect squares between two given numbers. A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. For example, 1, 4, 9, 16, and 25 are perfect squares.

The function should take two parameters, start and end, which represent the range of numbers to search for perfect squares. The function should return a list of all perfect squares in this range.

The unit test `assert perfect_squares(1,30)==[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]` helps to clarify the problem by providing an example of what the function should return.

Here is a Python solution for the problem:
```
def perfect_squares(start, end):
    return [i**2 for i in range(int(start**0.5), int(end**0.5)+1) if start <= i**2 <= end]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to generate the perfect squares. It iterates over the range of numbers from the square root of start to the square root of end (inclusive), and for each number, it checks if its square is within the range [start, end]. If it is, the square is added to the list. The function returns the list of perfect squares.
