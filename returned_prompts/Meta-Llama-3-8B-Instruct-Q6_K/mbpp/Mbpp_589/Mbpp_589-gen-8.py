    for i in range(int(start**0.5), int(end**0.5) + 1):

```
The function `perfect_squares` takes two parameters `start` and `end` representing the range of numbers. It iterates from the square root of `start` up to the square root of `end` (inclusive), and checks if the square of each number falls within the given range. If it does, the square is added to the `result` list. The function returns the list of perfect squares.

The unit test `assert perfect_squares(1,30)==[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]` ensures that the function works correctly for the given range. The test case checks if the function returns the expected list of perfect squares between 1 and 30. If the function passes the test, it means it is working correctly. If not, it means there is an issue with the function.
