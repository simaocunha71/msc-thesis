The given function calculates the sum of all odd length subarrays in the given array. It does this by iterating over all possible subarrays and checking if the length of the subarray is odd. If the length is odd, it calculates the sum of the subarray and adds it to the total sum. The function returns the total sum of all odd length subarrays.

The unit test `assert odd_length_sum([1,2,4]) == 14` ensures that the function works correctly. It checks that the sum of all odd length subarrays in the array `[1,2,4]` is indeed 14. 

This function has a time complexity of O(n^3) where n is the length of the array, because it has a triple loop structure. It has a space complexity of O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the sum and the indices of the subarrays. 

There might be a more efficient solution, but this function works correctly for the given problem. 

Note: This solution assumes that the input array is non-empty. If the input array can be empty, you might want to add a check at the beginning of the function to return 0 in that case. 

Also, the function can be optimized by calculating the sum of the subarray only once and then storing it in a variable, instead of recalculating it every time. This would reduce the time complexity to O(n^2). However, this would still be quite slow for large inputs. A more efficient solution would be to use a prefix sum array and then calculate the sum of the subarray in O(1) time. This would reduce the time complexity to O(n). 

Here is the optimized function:

```
def odd_length_sum(arr):
    prefix_sum = [0] * (len(arr) + 1)
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        prefix_sum[i+1] = prefix_sum[i] + arr[i]
    sum = 0
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        for j in range(i, len(arr)):
            if (j - i + 1) % 2 != 0:
                sum += prefix
