```
def get_coordinates(coordinate):
    x, y = coordinate
    adjacent_coordinates = []
    for i in range(x-1, x+2):
        for j in range(y-1, y+2):
            if (i, j) != (x, y):
                adjacent_coordinates.append([i, j])
    return adjacent_coordinates
```


The function `get_coordinates` takes a coordinate tuple as input and returns a list of all adjacent coordinates. The adjacent coordinates are the coordinates that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent to the given coordinate.

The function works by iterating over the range of x and y values around the given coordinate, and appending the coordinates that are not the same as the given coordinate to the list of adjacent coordinates.

The unit test `assert get_coordinates((3, 4)) == [[2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 5], [3, 3], [3, 4], [3, 5], [4, 3], [4, 4], [4, 5]]` ensures that the function returns the correct list of adjacent coordinates for a given coordinate.
