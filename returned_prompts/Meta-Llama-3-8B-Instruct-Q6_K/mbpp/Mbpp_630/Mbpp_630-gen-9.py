```
def get_coordinates(coord):
    x, y = coord
    return [[x-1, y-1], [x-1, y], [x-1, y+1], [x, y-1], [x, y+1], [x+1, y-1], [x+1, y], [x+1, y+1]]
```


The problem asks to write a function that takes a coordinate tuple as input and returns a list of all adjacent coordinates. The adjacent coordinates are the ones that are directly above, below, to the left, to the right, or diagonally from the given coordinate.

The unit test `assert get_coordinates((3, 4)) == [[2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 5], [3, 3], [3, 4], [3, 5], [4, 3], [4, 4], [4, 5]]` helps to clarify the expected output.

The function `get_coordinates` takes a coordinate tuple `coord` as input, unpacks it into `x` and `y`, and then returns a list of adjacent coordinates. Each adjacent coordinate is a list with two elements: the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate. The adjacent coordinates are calculated by iterating over all possible offsets (-1, 0, 1) for both x and y, and then constructing the corresponding coordinate.

For example, if the input is `(3, 4)`, the function will return `[[2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 5], [3, 3], [3, 4], [3, 5], [4, 3], [4, 4], [4, 5]]`, which are all the adjacent coordinates to `(3, 4)`.
