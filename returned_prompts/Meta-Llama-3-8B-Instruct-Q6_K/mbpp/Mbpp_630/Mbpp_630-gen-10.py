```
def get_coordinates(coords):
    x, y = coords
    return [[x-1, y-1], [x-1, y], [x-1, y+1], [x, y-1], [x, y+1], [x+1, y-1], [x+1, y], [x+1, y+1]]
```





The function `get_coordinates` takes a tuple of coordinates `(x, y)` as input and returns a list of all adjacent coordinates. The adjacent coordinates are calculated by considering the possible movements in the 2D grid (up, down, left, right). 

The unit test provided ensures that the function returns the correct adjacent coordinates for the given input `(3, 4)`. The expected output is a list of 9 coordinates, which are the adjacent coordinates to the input coordinate `(3, 4)`. 

The function works by iterating over the possible movements (up, down, left, right) and calculating the new coordinates by subtracting or adding 1 to the original x and y coordinates. The resulting coordinates are then added to the list of adjacent coordinates. 

The time complexity of this function is O(1) because it only involves a fixed number of calculations, regardless of the input size. The space complexity is also O(1) because it only requires a fixed amount of space to store the adjacent coordinates. 





Here is the unit test:

```
assert get_coordinates((3, 4)) == [[2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 5], [3, 3], [3, 4], [3, 5], [4, 3], [4, 4], [4, 5]]
```





This test ensures that the function returns the correct adjacent coordinates for the input `(3, 4)`. The expected output is a list of 9 coordinates, which are the adjacent coordinates to the input coordinate `(3, 4)`. The test passes if the function returns the expected output.
