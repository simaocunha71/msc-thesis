```
def get_coordinates(coordinate):
    x, y = coordinate
    return [[x-1, y-1], [x-1, y], [x-1, y+1], [x, y-1], [x, y+1], [x+1, y-1], [x+1, y], [x+1, y+1]]
```



The function `get_coordinates` takes a coordinate tuple `(x, y)` as input and returns a list of all adjacent coordinates. 

The adjacent coordinates are calculated by considering all possible positions that can be reached by moving one step up, down, left, right from the given coordinate. 

The unit test `assert get_coordinates((3, 4)) == [[2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 5], [3, 3], [3, 4], [3, 5], [4, 3], [4, 4], [4, 5]]` demonstrates this functionality. 

For the input `(3, 4)`, the function returns all the coordinates that are one step away from `(3, 4)`, which are `[(2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)]`.
