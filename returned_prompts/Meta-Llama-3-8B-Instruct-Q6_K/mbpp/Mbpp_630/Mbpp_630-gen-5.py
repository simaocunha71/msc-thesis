```
def get_coordinates(coord):
    x, y = coord
    return [[i, j] for i in range(x-1, x+2) for j in range(y-1, y+2) if 0 <= i <= 5 and 0 <= j <= 5]
```


The given function `get_coordinates` takes a coordinate tuple `(x, y)` as input and returns a list of all the adjacent coordinates. The adjacent coordinates are calculated by iterating over the range of `x-1` to `x+1` and the range of `y-1` to `y+1`. The condition `if 0 <= i <= 5 and 0 <= j <= 5` is used to ensure that the coordinates are within the valid range. The function then returns the list of adjacent coordinates. 

The unit test `assert get_coordinates((3, 4)) == [[2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 5], [3, 3], [3, 4], [3, 5], [4, 3], [4, 4], [4, 5]]` shows that the function returns the expected list of adjacent coordinates for the input `(3, 4)`.
