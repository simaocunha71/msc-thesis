def get_coordinates(coord):
    x, y = coord
    return [[x-1, y-1], [x-1, y], [x-1, y+1], [x, y-1], [x, y+1], [x+1, y-1], [x+1, y], [x+1, y+1]]

Explanation:
The function `get_coordinates` takes a tuple `coord` as input, which represents a coordinate in a 2D space. The function returns a list of lists, where each inner list represents an adjacent coordinate. The adjacent coordinates are calculated by modifying the x and y values of the input coordinate by -1, 0, and 1.

For example, if the input coordinate is `(3, 4)`, the function returns a list of lists, where each inner list represents an adjacent coordinate. The adjacent coordinates are `[(2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)]`. This is confirmed by the unit test `assert get_coordinates((3, 4)) == [[2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 5], [3, 3], [3, 4], [3, 5], [4, 3], [4, 4], [4, 5]]`. The unit test checks if the output of the function matches the expected output. If the output matches, the function is correct. If the output does not match, the function is incorrect. In this case, the function is correct, so the unit test passes.
