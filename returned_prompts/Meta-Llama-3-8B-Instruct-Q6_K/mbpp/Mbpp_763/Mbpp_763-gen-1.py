Explanation:
This function takes an array and the size of the array as input and returns the minimum difference between any two elements in the array. 

First, we sort the array in ascending order. Then we iterate through the array, calculating the difference between each pair of adjacent elements. We keep track of the minimum difference found so far and return it at the end. 

The unit test `assert find_min_diff((1,5,3,19,18,25),6) == 1` ensures that the function works correctly. 

The time complexity of this function is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the size of the array. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the minimum difference and the loop index.
