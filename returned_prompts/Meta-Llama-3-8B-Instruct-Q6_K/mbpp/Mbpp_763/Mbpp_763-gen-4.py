```
def find_min_diff(arr, k):
    arr.sort()
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        diff = arr[i] - arr[i-1]
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
    return min_diff
```
The function `find_min_diff` takes a list of numbers `arr` and an integer `k` as input. It sorts the list, then iterates over the list to find the minimum difference between any two adjacent elements. The function returns the minimum difference.

The unit test `assert find_min_diff((1,5,3,19,18,25),6) == 1` is used to verify the correctness of the function. It checks if the function returns the correct minimum difference for the given input.

Note: The problem statement does not specify whether the minimum difference should be less than or equal to a given constant `k`. However, based on the unit test provided, it seems that the function should return the minimum difference between any two elements in the array, without considering a given constant `k`. If the problem statement is modified to include the constant `k`, the function would need to be modified accordingly.
