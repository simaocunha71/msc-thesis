This function iterates over the elements of the first list. For each element, it checks if the element is present in both the second and the third lists. If the element is present in both lists, and it is not already in the list of common elements, it is added to the list of common elements. The function returns the list of common elements. 

Note: This function does not consider the indices of the elements in the lists, it only checks if the elements are present in all three lists. If you want to consider the indices, you would need to modify the function to store the indices along with the elements and then return the common elements along with their indices.  The unit test `assert extract_index_list([1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7],[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7])==[1, 7]` suggests that the function should return the common elements without considering their indices.  Therefore, the function is implemented to return a list of common elements without considering their indices.  If you want to consider the indices, you would need to modify the function accordingly.  For example, you could return a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element and its index if it is present in all three lists.  For example, the function could return `[(1, 0), (1, 1), (7, 6)]` for the input `([1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7],[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7])`.  However, this would require a significant modification of the function.  The function as it is currently implemented does not consider the indices of the elements in the lists.  It only checks if the elements are present in all three lists.  Therefore, it returns
