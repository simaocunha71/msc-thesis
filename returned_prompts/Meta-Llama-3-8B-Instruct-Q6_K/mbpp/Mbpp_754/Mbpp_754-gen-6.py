The provided unit test suggests that we need to find elements that appear at the same index in all three lists. The function `extract_index_list` does this by first finding the common indices in the three lists, and then returning the elements at those indices.

For example, when we call `extract_index_list([1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7])`, it returns `[1, 7]` because these are the elements that appear at the same index in all three lists.

This function uses list comprehensions to achieve this. The first list comprehension finds the common indices in the three lists, and the second list comprehension returns the elements at those indices.  It assumes that the lists are of the same length. If the lists are of different lengths, it will raise an IndexError.  If you want to handle lists of different lengths, you should add a check to ensure that the lists are of the same length before trying to access elements at specific indices.  You could do this by using the `zip_longest` function from the `itertools` module, which returns an iterator that aggregates elements from each of the iterables. If the iterables are of uneven length, missing values are filled-in with fillvalue. It's a good practice to include such error handling code in your functions to make them more robust.  Here is the updated function:

```
import itertools

def extract_index_list(list1, list2, list3):
    if len(list1) != len(list2) or len(list1) != len(list3):
        return "Lists must be of the same length"
    common_index_list = [i for i in range(len(list1)) if list1[i] in list2 and list1[i] in list3]
    return [list1[i] for i in common_index_list]
```

This function now checks if the lists are of the same length before trying to find common indices and elements. If the lists
