The function `extract_index_list` takes three lists as input. It first creates a list of indices where elements from `list1` are common with `list2` and `list3`. Then it creates a list of elements that are common in all three lists. This function assumes that the input lists are of the same length.

The unit test `assert extract_index_list([1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7],[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7])==[1, 7]` ensures that the function returns the correct result. It checks that the function returns `[1, 7]` when given the input lists `[1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7]`, and `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7]`. This is because `1` and `7` are the only elements that appear in all three lists under the same index. The function returns the correct result in this case.  



This function works by iterating through the list1 and checking if the element at the current index is present in both list2 and list3. If the element is present in both list2 and list3, it adds the index to the common_list. Then it iterates through the list1 and list2 and list3 and checks if the element at the current index is present in all three lists. If the element is present in all three lists, it adds the element to the common_elements list.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the list1. This is because the function iterates through the list1 twice. The space complexity is also O(n), where n is the length of the list1. This is because the function creates two lists of indices and elements.
