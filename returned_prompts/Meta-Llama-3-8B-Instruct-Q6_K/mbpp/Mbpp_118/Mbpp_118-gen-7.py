```
def string_to_list(s):
    return s.split()
```





The problem is asking to create a function that takes a string as an input and returns a list of strings where the input string is split by spaces.

The unit test provided, `assert string_to_list("python programming")==['python','programming']`, helps to clarify that the function should split the string at each space character and return a list of the resulting substrings.

The solution to this problem is a simple function that uses the `split` method of the string. This method splits the string into a list of substrings, using the space character as the delimiter. The function takes a string `s` as an input, splits it at each space character, and returns the resulting list of substrings.

Here's the solution:
```
def string_to_list(s):
    return s.split()
```
