"""
The problem is asking for a function that takes a string as input and returns a list of strings, where each string is a word in the original string. The words are separated by the space character.

The unit test `assert string_to_list("python programming")==['python','programming']` helps to clarify this. It shows that the function should split the input string into words and return them as a list.

Here is a Python solution for the problem:
```
def string_to_list(s):
    return s.split()
```
This function uses the `split` method of the string class in Python, which splits the string into a list of words separated by the space character. The result is a list of strings, where each string is a word in the original string. For example, if the input string is "python programming", the function will return the list ['python', 'programming'].```python
def string_to_list(s):
    return s.split()
```
