```
def string_to_list(s):
    return s.split()
```


This function uses Python's built-in string method `split()` which splits a string into a list where each word is a list item. The default separator is a space character, so we don't need to specify it. 

The unit test `assert string_to_list("python programming")==['python','programming']` confirms that the function works as expected, splitting the input string into a list of two items. 

The function is simple and efficient, as it relies on Python's built-in functionality. It does not need any additional libraries or modules.
