```
import math
import cmath

def angle_complex(real, imag):
    return math.atan2(imag.real, real)
```





This problem is asking you to write a function that calculates the angle (in radians) of a complex number. The complex number is given as a real part and an imaginary part. The function should use the math.atan2 function from the math module to calculate the angle.

The unit test `assert math.isclose(angle_complex(0,1j), 1.5707963267948966, rel_tol=0.001)` helps to clarify the problem by providing an example of how the function should behave. In this case, the function should return the angle of the complex number 0 + 1j, which is pi/2 (or 1.5707963267948966 in radians).

Here is the solution:
```
import math
import cmath

def angle_complex(real, imag):
    return math.atan2(imag.real, real)
```
This function takes two arguments, `real` and `imag`, which are the real and imaginary parts of the complex number. It returns the angle of the complex number in radians. The `math.atan2` function is used to calculate the angle, which takes two arguments: the imaginary part of the complex number and the real part of the complex number. The `imag.real` is used to get the real part of the imaginary part, because `imag` is a complex number itself.
