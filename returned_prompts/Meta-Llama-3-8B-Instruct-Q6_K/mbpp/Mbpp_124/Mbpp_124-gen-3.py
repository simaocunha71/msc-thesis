The problem is asking to write a function that calculates the angle of a complex number in radians. The complex number is represented by its real and imaginary parts. The function should return the angle in radians.
The unit test provided is `assert math.isclose(angle_complex(0,1j), 1.5707963267948966, rel_tol=0.001)`. This test checks if the function correctly calculates the angle of the complex number 1j, which is the imaginary unit i, as 90 degrees or Ï€/2 radians.
The solution uses the `atan2` function from the `math` module, which calculates the angle of a complex number in radians. The `atan2` function takes two arguments, the imaginary part and the real part of the complex number, and returns the angle in radians. The `cmath` module is not necessary in this problem, but it can be used to create complex numbers.
The `math.isclose` function is used to compare the calculated angle with the expected angle. The `math.isclose` function checks if the two numbers are close to each other, within a certain tolerance. In this case, the tolerance is set to 0.001, which means the calculated angle is considered correct if it is within 0.001 radians of the expected angle.
