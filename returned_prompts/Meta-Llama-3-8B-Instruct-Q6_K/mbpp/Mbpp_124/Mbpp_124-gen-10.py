```
import cmath
import math

def angle_complex(real, imag):
    return math.degrees(cmath.phase(complex(real, imag)))
```





The problem is asking to write a function that calculates the angle of a complex number. The angle is defined as the phase of the complex number, which is the angle from the positive real axis to the point in the complex plane. 

The function should take two arguments, `real` and `imag`, which are the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, respectively. 

The unit test provided suggests that the function should return the angle in degrees, rather than radians. 

Here is the solution in Python:
```
import cmath
import math

def angle_complex(real, imag):
    return math.degrees(cmath.phase(complex(real, imag)))
```
This function uses the `cmath` module to create a complex number from the real and imaginary parts, and then uses the `phase` function to calculate the phase of the complex number. The `math.degrees` function is used to convert the phase from radians to degrees. 

The unit test provided ensures that the function returns the correct angle for the complex number 0 + i, which is 90 degrees. 

This function can be used to calculate the angle of any complex number, and it is accurate to 3 decimal places, as specified in the unit test.
