The problem is asking to write a function that calculates the angle of a complex number. The angle is defined as the phase angle of the complex number, which is the argument of the complex exponential function. This can be calculated using the arctangent function `atan2`.

The unit test `assert math.isclose(angle_complex(0,1j), 1.5707963267948966, rel_tol=0.001)` suggests that the function should be able to calculate the angle of a complex number with real part 0 and imaginary part 1j, which corresponds to the complex number i (the imaginary unit). The expected output is pi/2, which is approximately 1.5707963267948966.

The function `angle_complex` takes two arguments, `real` and `imag`, which are the real and imaginary parts of the complex number. It returns the angle of the complex number using the `atan2` function. The `atan2` function takes two arguments, `y` and `x`, and returns the arctangent of `y/x`. In this case, `y` is the imaginary part and `x` is the real part of the complex number. This ensures that the angle is calculated correctly even if the complex number is in the fourth quadrant.
