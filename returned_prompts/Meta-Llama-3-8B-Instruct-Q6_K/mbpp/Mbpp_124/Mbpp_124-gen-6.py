The function `angle_complex` takes two parameters `a` and `b` representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. It uses the `cmath` module to create a complex number from these parts, and then uses the `phase` function to get the angle of the complex number in radians. The `phase` function is the same as the `arg` function, which returns the phase angle in radians. The phase angle is the angle between the positive real axis and the line connecting the origin to the point in the complex plane. The `math.isclose` function is used in the unit test to check if the result is close to the expected result within a certain tolerance. The `cmath` module provides the `phase` function to calculate the phase angle, which is the same as the `arg` function. The `arg` function returns the phase angle in radians.
