"""
The problem is asking to create a function that takes two tuples as input and returns a new tuple where the elements of the first tuple are subtracted by the corresponding elements of the second tuple.

From the given unit test, `assert substract_elements((10, 4, 5), (2, 5, 18)) == (8, -1, -13)`, we can understand that the function should work element-wise, subtracting the elements of the first tuple from the elements of the second tuple.

Here's the Python solution for the problem:
```
def substract_elements(t1, t2):
    return tuple(x - y for x, y in zip(t1, t2))
```
This function uses the built-in `zip` function to iterate over the elements of the two tuples in parallel, and the `tuple` function to convert the result to a tuple. The expression `x - y` subtracts the corresponding elements of the two tuples.„Äç
