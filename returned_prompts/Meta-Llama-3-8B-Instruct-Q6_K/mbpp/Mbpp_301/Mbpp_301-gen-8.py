The problem is asking to write a function that calculates the depth of a dictionary. The depth of a dictionary is the maximum number of keys that need to be traversed to get to the deepest value in the dictionary.

Here is a Python function that solves this problem:

```Python
def dict_depth(d, depth=1):
    max_depth = depth
    for k, v in d.items():
        if isinstance(v, dict):
            max_depth = max(max_depth, dict_depth(v, depth + 1))
    return max_depth
```

This function works by recursively iterating over the dictionary and its sub-dictionaries. If a sub-dictionary is found, the function calls itself with the sub-dictionary and the current depth incremented by 1. The maximum depth found during this process is returned as the result.

For example, if we have the following dictionary:

```Python
d = {'a':1, 'b': {'c': {'d': {}}}}
```

The function `dict_depth(d)` will return `4`, which is the maximum depth of the dictionary. This is because we need to traverse 4 keys to get to the deepest value in the dictionary: `d -> b -> c -> d`. 

The unit test `assert dict_depth({'a':1, 'b': {'c': {'d': {}}}})==4` ensures that the function works correctly for this specific case.
