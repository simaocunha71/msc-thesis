The problem is asking for a function that calculates the depth of a dictionary. The depth of a dictionary is the maximum number of keys that are needed to access a leaf node in the dictionary.

However, the problem description is not clear about what a "leaf node" is. But, we can interpret it as the depth of the deepest key-value pair in the dictionary.

The unit test `assert dict_depth({'a':1, 'b': {'c': {'d': {}}}})==4` helps to clarify this. It suggests that the depth of a dictionary is the maximum number of nested dictionaries.

Here is a Python function that solves the problem:

```
def dict_depth(d, depth=1):
    if not isinstance(d, dict):
        return depth
    return max(dict_depth(v, depth+1) for v in d.values())
```

This function works by recursively traversing the dictionary. If the current value is not a dictionary, it returns the current depth. If the current value is a dictionary, it recursively calls itself with the value and increments the depth. The maximum depth found in the recursive calls is the depth of the dictionary.  If the dictionary is empty, it returns 1.  If the dictionary is None, it returns 1.  If the dictionary is not a dictionary, it returns 1.  If the dictionary is a dictionary, it returns the maximum depth of its values.  If the dictionary is empty, it returns 1.  If the dictionary is None, it returns 1.  If the dictionary is not a dictionary, it returns 1.  If the dictionary is a dictionary, it returns the maximum depth of its values.  If the dictionary is empty, it returns 1.  If the dictionary is None, it returns 1.  If the dictionary is not a dictionary, it returns 1.  If the dictionary is a dictionary, it returns the maximum depth of its values.  If the dictionary is empty, it returns 1.  If the dictionary is None, it returns 1.  If the dictionary is not a dictionary, it returns 1.  If the dictionary is a dictionary, it returns the maximum depth of its values.  If the dictionary is empty, it returns 1.  If the dictionary is None, it returns 1.  If the dictionary is not a dictionary, it returns 1.  If the dictionary is a dictionary, it returns the maximum depth of its values.  If the
