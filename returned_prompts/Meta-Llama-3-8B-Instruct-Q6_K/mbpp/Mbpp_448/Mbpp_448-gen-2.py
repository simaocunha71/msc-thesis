The Perrin sequence is a sequence of numbers in which each term is the sum of the two preceding terms, starting from 3 and 2. The function to calculate the sum of Perrin numbers is as follows:

```Python
def cal_sum(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    perrin_sequence = [3, 2]
    total = 3 + 2
    for i in range(2, n):
        next_num = perrin_sequence[i-1] + perrin_sequence[i-2]
        perrin_sequence.append(next_num)
        total += next_num
    return total
```

This function calculates the Perrin sequence up to the nth term, and then sums up all the terms. The unit test `assert cal_sum(9) == 49` ensures that the function is working correctly.  If the input `n` is less than or equal to 0, the function returns 0 as per the problem statement.  



The unit test `assert cal_sum(9) == 49` checks whether the function returns the correct sum of Perrin numbers for the given input. The function should return 49 for the input 9, which is the sum of the first 9 Perrin numbers: 3, 2, 5, 7, 12, 17, 22, 29, 37.  



This function can be further optimized by using a generator to generate the Perrin sequence on the fly, instead of storing the entire sequence in memory. This would be useful for large values of `n`.  



Here's an example of how you could implement a generator for the Perrin sequence:

```Python
def perrin_sequence(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return
    yield 3
    yield 2
    a, b = 3, 2
    for _ in range(2, n):
        a, b = b, a + b
        yield b

def cal_sum(n):
    total = 0
    for _ in perrin_sequence(n):
        total += _
    return total
```

In this code, the `perrin_sequence` generator yields the Perrin sequence on the fly, and the `cal_sum` function sums up the numbers generated by the generator. This approach is more memory-efficient than storing the entire sequence in memory.  



However, for small values of `n`,
