The problem is asking to write a function that calculates the sum of Perrin numbers up to a given number. The Perrin sequence is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 3 and 2.

The unit test `assert cal_sum(9) == 49` suggests that we need to calculate the sum of Perrin numbers up to 9.

Here is a Python solution for the problem:

```
def cal_sum(n):
    a, b, c = 3, 2, 0
    total = 0
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b, c = b, c, a + b
        if c <= n:
            total += c
    return total
```

This function initializes the first three Perrin numbers as 3, 2, and 0, and then iterates `n` times. In each iteration, it updates the Perrin numbers and adds the current number to the total sum if it is less than or equal to `n`. Finally, it returns the total sum.
