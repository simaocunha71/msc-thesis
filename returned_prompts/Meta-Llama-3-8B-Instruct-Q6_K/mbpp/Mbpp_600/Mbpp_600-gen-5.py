def is_Even(n):

    else:
        return False
```
This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is even, otherwise `False`. The condition `n % 2 == 0` checks whether the remainder of `n` divided by 2 is 0, which is the case for even numbers. The unit test `assert is_Even(1) == False` ensures that the function correctly identifies odd numbers as `False`.  For example, `is_Even(4)` would return `True`, and `is_Even(3)` would return `False`.  You can use this function to check whether a given number is even or not.  For instance, you could use `is_Even(10)` to get `True` and `is_Even(11)` to get `False`.  This function can be used in various contexts, such as in a program that needs to perform calculations on even and odd numbers, or in a game that requires players to identify even and odd numbers.  It can also be used in a data analysis context, where you need to filter out odd numbers from a dataset.  For example, you could use this function to create a list of even numbers from a list of integers.  You could also use it to check whether a given number is even or not in a user interface, such as in a game or a calculator.  In summary, this function provides a way to check whether a given number is even or not, and it can be used in a variety of contexts.  It is a simple and efficient way to identify even and odd numbers, and it can be used in a wide range of applications.  It is also easy to understand and use, making it a great tool for developers and non-developers alike.  It can be used in a variety of programming languages, including Python, Java, C++, and many others.  It is a versatile and useful function that can be used in many different contexts.  It is a great tool for anyone who needs to work with even and odd numbers.  It is easy to use and can be used in a wide range of applications.
