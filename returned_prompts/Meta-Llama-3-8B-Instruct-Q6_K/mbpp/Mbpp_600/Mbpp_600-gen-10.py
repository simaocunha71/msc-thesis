```
def is_Even(n):
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```
The function is_Even(n) checks whether the given number n is even or not. It returns True if the number is even and False if the number is odd. The condition n % 2 == 0 checks whether the remainder of n divided by 2 is 0, which is true for even numbers and false for odd numbers. This function satisfies the given unit test as well. 

For example, is_Even(1) returns False because 1 is an odd number.  is_Even(4) returns True because 4 is an even number.
