The function `find_Index(n)` calculates the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits. It starts from 1 and generates triangular numbers until it finds the one with n digits. The index of the smallest triangular number with n digits is returned. The time complexity of this function is O(n). The unit test `assert find_Index(2) == 4` ensures the function works correctly. For example, the smallest triangular number with 2 digits is 6, and its index is 3, but the function should return 4 because the smallest triangular number with 2 digits is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.  The function `find_Index(n)` is able to find the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits correctly.  



The time complexity of this function is O(n). The function iterates over the triangular numbers until it finds the one with n digits. The time complexity is linear with respect to the number of digits n. The space complexity is O(1), which means the space required does not change with the size of the input, it's constant. The space complexity is constant because the function uses a constant amount of space to store the variables i, count and triangular_number.  



This function is suitable for finding the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits. It's efficient and works correctly. However, it's not suitable for very large values of n because it can take a long time to find the smallest triangular number with n digits. For very large values of n, a more efficient algorithm or a different approach may be needed.  



The unit test `assert find_Index(2) == 4` ensures the function works correctly. It checks if the function returns the correct index for the smallest triangular number with 2 digits. The function should return 4 because the smallest triangular number with 2 digits is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, and its index is 4. The unit test ensures the function works correctly for small values of n.  



The function `find_Index(n)` is able to find the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits correctly. It's a simple and efficient
