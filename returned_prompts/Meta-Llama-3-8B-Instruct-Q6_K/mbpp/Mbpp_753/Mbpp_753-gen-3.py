```
def min_k(tuples, k):
    return sorted(tuples, key=lambda x: x[1])[:k]
```
This function sorts the tuples based on the second element of each tuple (which is the score) and then returns the first k tuples. This will give us the k smallest scores.

The unit test `assert min_k([('Manjeet', 10), ('Akshat', 4), ('Akash', 2), ('Nikhil', 8)], 2) == [('Akash', 2), ('Akshat', 4)]` ensures that the function works correctly. It checks that the function returns the tuples with the smallest scores when given a list of tuples and an integer k. 

The function `min_k` takes two parameters: `tuples` which is a list of tuples and `k` which is an integer. It returns a list of the k smallest tuples. The tuples are sorted based on their second element (the score) and then the first k tuples are returned. 

The unit test is a good way to verify that the function works correctly. It provides a specific input and expected output, and the function should return the expected output for that input. In this case, the input is `min_k([('Manjeet', 10), ('Akshat', 4), ('Akash', 2), ('Nikhil', 8)], 2)` and the expected output is `[['Akash', 2], ['Akshat', 4]]`. The function should return this output when given this input. 

This function will work correctly for any input that is a list of tuples and an integer, as long as the integer is less than or equal to the length of the list. If the integer is greater than the length of the list, the function will return all the tuples in the list. If the integer is less than 1, the function will return an empty list. 

The time complexity of this function is O(n log n) because it uses the built-in sort function which has a time complexity of O(n log n). The space complexity is O(n) because it needs to store the sorted list of tuples.
