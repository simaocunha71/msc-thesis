The problem is asking you to create a function that calculates the volume of a cylinder given its radius and height. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is pi * radius^2 * height.

The unit test `assert math.isclose(volume_cylinder(10,5), 1570.7500000000002, rel_tol=0.001)` suggests that the result should be a floating point number with a certain degree of precision. 

In this solution, we use the `math.pi` constant to represent the value of pi, and the `**` operator to calculate the square of the radius. The result is then returned by the function.

The `math.isclose` function is used in the unit test to check if the calculated volume is close to the expected result with a relative tolerance of 0.001. This means that the calculated volume can be up to 0.1% away from the expected result and still be considered correct.
