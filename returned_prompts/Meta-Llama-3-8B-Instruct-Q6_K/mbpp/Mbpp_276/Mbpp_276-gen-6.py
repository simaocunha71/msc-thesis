```
import math

def volume_cylinder(radius, height):
    return math.pi * radius ** 2 * height
```


The problem is asking to create a function that calculates the volume of a cylinder given its radius and height. The volume of a cylinder is calculated using the formula `Ï€r^2h`, where `r` is the radius and `h` is the height.

The unit test provided suggests that the result should be a floating point number with a high degree of precision. Therefore, we can use the `math.pi` constant and the `**` operator to calculate the volume.

Here's the solution:

```python
import math

def volume_cylinder(radius, height):
    return math.pi * radius ** 2 * height
```

This function takes in the radius and height of a cylinder as input, and returns the calculated volume. The `math.pi` constant is used to get the value of pi, and the `**` operator is used to raise the radius to the power of 2. The result is then multiplied by the height to get the total volume.
