This problem is asking you to write a function that calculates the volume of a cylinder given its radius and height. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is pi * r^2 * h, where r is the radius and h is the height.

The unit test provided is `assert math.isclose(volume_cylinder(10,5), 1570.7500000000002, rel_tol=0.001)`, which means the function should return 1570.7500000000002 when given the radius 10 and height 5.

The solution is a simple function that takes in the radius and height, and returns the calculated volume using the formula. The `math.isclose` function is used to compare the calculated volume with the expected result, with a relative tolerance of 0.001. This means that the function is considered correct if the calculated volume is within 0.1% of the expected result.
