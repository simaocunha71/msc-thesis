```
def replace_spaces(s):
    return s.replace(' ', '%20')
```


Explanation:
The problem is asking to create a function that takes a string as input and returns the same string but with all spaces replaced with '%20'. 

The given unit test `assert replace_spaces("My Name is Dawood") == 'My%20Name%20is%20Dawood'` suggests that the function should replace all spaces in the string with '%20'. 

The solution to this problem is to use the built-in `replace` method of Python strings. This method takes two arguments, the first is the substring to be replaced and the second is the replacement string. In this case, we want to replace all spaces with '%20', so we use `s.replace(' ', '%20')`. 

This function works by iterating over each character in the string and replacing any spaces with '%20'. It returns the modified string. 

The unit test provided ensures that the function is working correctly by comparing the output of the function with the expected output. If the output of the function matches the expected output, then the function is working correctly. 

Here is the solution in Python:
```
def replace_spaces(s):
    return s.replace(' ', '%20')
``` 





# This is a solution for the problem where we need to replace all spaces in the given string with '%20'. The given unit test is assert replace_spaces("My Name is Dawood") == 'My%20Name%20is%20Dawood'.

# The function replace_spaces takes a string as input and returns the same string but with all spaces replaced with '%20'.

# The solution to this problem is to use the built-in replace method of Python strings. This method takes two arguments, the first is the substring to be replaced and the second is the replacement string. In this case, we want to replace all spaces with '%20', so we use s.replace(' ', '%20').

# The unit test provided ensures that the function is working correctly by comparing the output of the function with the expected output. If the output of the function matches the expected output, then the function is working correctly.

# The function replace_spaces is defined as follows:
def replace_spaces(s):
    return s.replace(' ', '%20')

# Now, if we call the function with the input "My Name is Dawood", it will return 'My%20Name%20is%20Dawood', which matches the expected output in the unit test. Therefore
