```
def pancake_sort(arr):
    result = []
    for size in range(len(arr), 0, -1):
        max_index = arr.index(max(arr[:size]))
        if max_index != size - 1:
            if max_index != 0:
                arr[:max_index + 1] = arr[:max_index + 1][::-1]
                result.append(max_index + 1)
            arr[:size] = arr[:size][::-1]
            result.append(size - 1)
    return arr
```
The problem is asking you to write a function called `pancake_sort` that sorts a list of elements. The function should return the sorted list.

The problem doesn't specify the sorting algorithm to be used, but based on the unit test provided, it seems like the `pancake sort` algorithm should be used.

The `pancake sort` algorithm works by repeatedly finding the maximum element in the unsorted part of the list and flipping it to the front of the list. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.

Here is the solution:

```
def pancake_sort(arr):
    result = []
    for size in range(len(arr), 0, -1):
        max_index = arr.index(max(arr[:size]))
        if max_index != size - 1:
            if max_index != 0:
                arr[:max_index + 1] = arr[:max_index + 1][::-1]
                result.append(max_index + 1)
            arr[:size] = arr[:size][::-1]
            result.append(size - 1)
    return arr
```

This function works by iterating over the list from the end to the beginning. For each iteration, it finds the maximum element in the unsorted part of the list and flips it to the front of the list. The indices of the flips are added to the result list. The function returns the sorted list.
