```
def pancake_sort(arr):
    for i in range(len(arr), 0, -1):
        max_idx = arr.index(max(arr[:i]))
        if max_idx != i - 1:
            if max_idx != 0:
                arr[:max_idx+1] = arr[:max_idx+1][::-1]
            arr[:i] = arr[:i][::-1]
    return arr
```





The provided unit test is `assert pancake_sort([15, 79, 25, 38, 69]) == [15, 25, 38, 69, 79]`. This test suggests that the function should sort a list of elements in ascending order. The function should be able to handle lists of different lengths and should be able to sort lists with duplicate elements.

Here is a Python solution for the problem:

```
def pancake_sort(arr):
    for i in range(len(arr), 0, -1):
        max_idx = arr.index(max(arr[:i]))
        if max_idx != i - 1:
            if max_idx != 0:
                arr[:max_idx+1] = arr[:max_idx+1][::-1]
            arr[:i] = arr[:i][::-1]
    return arr
```

This function uses a technique called "pancake sorting" to sort the list. The idea is to find the maximum element in the list and move it to the end of the list. This is done by reversing the subarray from the start of the list to the index of the maximum element, and then reversing the subarray from the start of the list to the end of the list. This process is repeated until the list is sorted. The function returns the sorted list.

The unit test `assert pancake_sort([15, 79, 25, 38, 69]) == [15, 25, 38, 69, 79]` passes for this function. The function correctly sorts the list in ascending order.
