```
def pancake_sort(arr):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        max_idx = arr.index(max(arr[:i+1]))
        if max_idx != i:
            if max_idx != i:
                arr[:max_idx+1] = arr[:max_idx+1][::-1]
            arr[:i+1] = arr[:i+1][::-1]
    return arr

In this solution, we are implementing the pancake sort algorithm. This algorithm works by iterating over the list, finding the maximum element, and flipping it to the front of the list. The flipping is done by reversing the list from the start to the maximum index. This process is repeated until the list is sorted. 

The unit test `assert pancake_sort([15, 79, 25, 38, 69]) == [15, 25, 38, 69, 79]` is used to verify the correctness of the function. It checks if the function returns the expected sorted list for the given input. 

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2) because we are iterating over the list and reversing a sublist in each iteration. The space complexity is O(1) because we are not using any extra space that scales with the input size.
