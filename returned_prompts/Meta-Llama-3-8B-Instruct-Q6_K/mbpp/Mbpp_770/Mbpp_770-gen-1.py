The problem is asking to find the sum of the fourth power of the first n odd natural numbers. 

We can start by initializing a variable to store the sum and then iterate over the first n odd natural numbers. For each number, we calculate its fourth power and add it to the sum. 

Here is a Python function that accomplishes this:

```Python
def odd_num_sum(n):
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, 2*n, 2):
        total += i**4
    return total
```

This function works by iterating over the first n odd natural numbers (starting from 1) and adding the fourth power of each number to the total. The `range` function is used to generate the sequence of odd numbers, with a step size of 2 to ensure that only odd numbers are included. 

For example, if we call `odd_num_sum(2)`, the function will calculate the sum of the fourth power of the first 2 odd natural numbers (1 and 3), which is 1**4 + 3**4 = 1 + 81 = 82, as expected. 

This function has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), making it efficient for large values of n.
