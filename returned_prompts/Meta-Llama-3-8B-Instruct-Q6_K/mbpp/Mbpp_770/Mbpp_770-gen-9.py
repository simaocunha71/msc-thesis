```
def odd_num_sum(n):
    return sum(i**4 for i in range(1, 2*n, 2))
```


The function `odd_num_sum` calculates the sum of the fourth power of the first `n` odd natural numbers. It uses a generator expression inside the `sum` function to iterate over the range of odd numbers from 1 to `2*n-1` and calculates the fourth power of each number. The `range` function is used with a step size of 2 to generate only the odd numbers. 

For example, if `n` is 2, the function will calculate the sum of the fourth power of the first two odd numbers, which are 1 and 3, and return the result, which is 82. 

The unit test `assert odd_num_sum(2) == 82` ensures that the function is working correctly. 

The time complexity of this function is O(n), as it needs to iterate over the range of `n` odd numbers. The space complexity is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the sum and the range object.
