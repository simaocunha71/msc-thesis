```
def drop_empty(d):
    return {k: v for k, v in d.items() if v}
```



The problem is asking you to create a function that takes a dictionary as an input and returns a new dictionary with all the items that have empty values removed.

In the given unit test, it's specified that the function should remove items with None values, not just empty strings. This is important because the problem description doesn't explicitly state what constitutes an "empty" value.

Here's how you can solve this problem in Python:

You can use a dictionary comprehension to iterate over the items in the dictionary. For each item, you can use the condition `if v` to check if the value is truthy (i.e., not empty). If the value is truthy, you include the item in the new dictionary.

Here's the code:

```
def drop_empty(d):
    return {k: v for k, v in d.items() if v}
```

This function will return a new dictionary with all the items that have non-empty values. If you want to remove items with empty strings specifically, you can modify the condition to `if v != ''`. If you want to remove items with None values specifically, you can modify the condition to `if v is not None`.
