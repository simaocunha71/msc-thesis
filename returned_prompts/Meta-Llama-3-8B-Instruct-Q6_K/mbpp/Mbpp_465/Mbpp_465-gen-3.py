def drop_empty(d):
    return {k: v for k, v in d.items() if v is not None}
```


The provided unit test `assert drop_empty({'c1': 'Red', 'c2': 'Green', 'c3':None})=={'c1': 'Red', 'c2': 'Green'}` suggests that the function should remove items with `None` values from the dictionary. 

The function `drop_empty` uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary that includes only the key-value pairs where the value is not `None`. The `is not None` condition ensures that only non-empty items are included in the resulting dictionary. 
This solution passes the given unit test. 
```python
assert drop_empty({'c1': 'Red', 'c2': 'Green', 'c3':None})=={'c1': 'Red', 'c2': 'Green'}
``` 
The function works by iterating over each key-value pair in the dictionary, and including it in the new dictionary if the value is not `None`. This results in a new dictionary that has the same keys as the original dictionary, but only includes the key-value pairs where the value is not `None`. 
This solution is efficient because it only iterates over the key-value pairs in the dictionary once, and it does not create any intermediate data structures. 
It is also flexible because it can be easily modified to drop items based on different criteria, such as dropping items with empty strings or dropping items with values that are instances of a specific class. 
Overall, this solution is a good choice for this problem because it is efficient, flexible, and easy to understand.  ```python
