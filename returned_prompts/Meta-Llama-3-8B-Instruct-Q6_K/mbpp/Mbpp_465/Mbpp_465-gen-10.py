The function takes a dictionary as an argument and returns a new dictionary with the same keys as the original dictionary, but with values that are not empty. In the case of the given problem, we need to remove the None values from the dictionary. 

The unit test `assert drop_empty({'c1': 'Red', 'c2': 'Green', 'c3':None})=={'c1': 'Red', 'c2': 'Green'}` shows that the function should remove the key-value pair with 'c3' as the key and None as the value. 

The `drop_empty` function uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary with the desired key-value pairs. The condition `if v` in the comprehension ensures that only key-value pairs with non-empty values are included in the new dictionary. 

For example, if the input dictionary is `{'c1': 'Red', 'c2': 'Green', 'c3':None}`, the `drop_empty` function will return `{'c1': 'Red', 'c2': 'Green'}`. 

The function does not modify the original dictionary, it returns a new dictionary with the desired key-value pairs. 

Note: The problem statement does not specify the type of values that should be considered "empty". In this solution, we consider None as the only "empty" value. If you want to consider other types of values as "empty" (e.g., empty strings, lists, etc.), you would need to modify the condition in the dictionary comprehension accordingly.
