  return sorted(tuples_list, key=lambda x: x[1])  # Sorts the list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple.  # The sorted function is a built-in Python function that returns a new sorted list from the elements of any sequence.  # The key parameter is a function that takes one argument and returns one value.  # The lambda function is an anonymous function that can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.  # In this case, the lambda function returns the second element of each tuple.  # The sorted function will sort the list based on these values.  # The default sort order is ascending, so the list will be sorted based on the second element of each tuple in ascending order.  # To sort in descending order, the reverse parameter can be set to True.  # For example, sorted(tuples_list, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True) would sort the list in descending order.  # The sorted function returns a new list and does not modify the original list.  # The original list remains unchanged.  # The sorted function can also sort a list of lists.  # For example, sorted([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]], key=lambda x: x[0]) would sort the list of lists based on the first element of each sublist.  # The sorted function can also sort a list of dictionaries.  # For example, sorted([{'name': 'John', 'age': 25}, {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}, {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 20}], key=lambda x: x['age']) would sort the list of dictionaries based on the 'age' key.  # The sorted function can also sort a list of tuples.  # For example, sorted([('John', 25), ('Alice', 30), ('Bob', 20)], key=lambda x: x[1]) would sort the list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple.  # The sorted function can also sort a list of sets.  # For example, sorted({1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, key=lambda x: x) would sort the set based on the elements of the set.  # The sorted function can also sort a list of lists of lists.  # For example, sorted([[1, 2], [3
