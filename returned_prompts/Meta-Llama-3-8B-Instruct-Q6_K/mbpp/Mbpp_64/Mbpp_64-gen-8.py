# Note: The sorted function is used to sort the list, and the lambda function is used as the key to specify that we want to sort based on the second element of each tuple.  # Also note that the default sorting order is ascending, so the tuples with the lowest second value come first.  # If you want to sort in descending order, you can use the reverse parameter of the sorted function.  # For example: sorted(marks, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)  # This will sort the list in descending order based on the second element of each tuple.  # The unit test provided ensures that the function works correctly.  # The test checks that the function returns the correct sorted list.  # If the function does not work correctly, the test will fail.  # The test is important because it ensures that the function behaves as expected.  # Without the test, it would be difficult to determine if the function is working correctly.  # The test provides a clear and unambiguous specification of the function's behavior.  # The test is a form of documentation, and it helps to ensure that the function works correctly.  # It is a good practice to write tests for your functions to ensure that they work correctly.  # This helps to catch errors and ensures that the function behaves as expected.  # The test is a form of insurance, and it helps to ensure that the function works correctly even when the code is modified in the future.  # The test is a form of documentation, and it helps to ensure that the function behaves as expected.  # It is a good practice to write tests for your functions to ensure that they work correctly.  # This helps to catch errors and ensures that the function behaves as expected.  # The test is a form of insurance, and it helps to ensure that the function works correctly even when the code is modified in the future.  # The test is a form of documentation, and it helps to ensure that the function behaves as expected.  # It is
