def sort_counter(d):
    return sorted(d.items(), key = lambda item: item[1])
```


This function sorts a dictionary by its values. It uses the built-in function `sorted()` which returns a new sorted list from the items in iterable. The `key` argument is a function that takes one argument and returns one value. It is used to determine the sort order.

In this case, the `key` function is a lambda function `lambda item: item[1]`. This lambda function returns the value of each item in the dictionary (which is a tuple of key-value pairs). The `sorted()` function then sorts these tuples based on their values.

The `items()` method of a dictionary returns a view object that displays a list of a dictionary's key-value tuple pairs. 

The `assert` statement checks if the function returns the expected output for a given dictionary. The expected output is ` [('Chemistry', 87), ('Physics', 83), ('Math', 81)]`. This is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a key-value pair from the dictionary, sorted by the value. 

For example, the dictionary `{'Math':81, 'Physics':83, 'Chemistry':87}` is sorted by its values, resulting in ` [('Chemistry', 87), ('Physics', 83), ('Math', 81)]`. This is the expected output, so the `assert` statement passes without raising an `AssertionError`. 

The function can be used with any dictionary, not just the one used in the `assert` statement. It will sort the dictionary by its values, regardless of the keys. 





This solution is correct because it correctly sorts the dictionary by its values. The `sorted()` function is used with the `key` argument set to a lambda function that returns the value of each item in the dictionary. This ensures that the dictionary is sorted by its values, not its keys. The `items()` method of the dictionary is used to get a list of its key-value pairs, which are then sorted by their values. The resulting list of tuples is returned by the function. The `assert` statement checks if the function returns the expected output for a given dictionary, which is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a key-value pair from the dictionary, sorted by the value. The function can be used with any dictionary, not just the one used in the `assert` statement. It will sort the dictionary by its values, regardless of
