"""
You want a function that matches a string that has an 'a' followed by exactly three 'b's. 

The unit test `assert not text_match_three("ac")` suggests that the function should return False for a string that does not have three 'b's after an 'a'. 

Here is the Python function that accomplishes this:

```
def text_match_three(text):
    return text.count("ab") > 0 and text.count("abb") > 0 and text.count("abbb") > 0
```

This function uses the `count` method of the string, which returns the number of occurrences of the substring. If the count of "ab", "abb", and "abbb" is greater than 0, it means the string has an 'a' followed by three 'b's, so the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False. 

For example, `text_match_three("abbb")` will return True, and `text_match_three("ac")` will return False.```python
```python
def text_match_three(text):
    return text.count("ab") > 0 and text.count("abb") > 0 and text.count("abbb") > 0
```python
```
This function uses the `count` method of the string, which returns the number of occurrences of the substring. If the count of "ab", "abb", and "abbb" is greater than 0, it means the string has an 'a' followed by three 'b's, so the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False. 

For example, `text_match_three("abbb")` will return True, and `text_match_three("ac")` will return False.```python
```python
```
Note that this function considers overlapping matches. For example, `text_match_three("abbbabbb")` will return True, because it has multiple occurrences of "ab" followed by three 'b's. If you want to consider non-overlapping matches, you can modify the function to keep track of the last position of a match and start searching for the next match from that position.```python
```python
