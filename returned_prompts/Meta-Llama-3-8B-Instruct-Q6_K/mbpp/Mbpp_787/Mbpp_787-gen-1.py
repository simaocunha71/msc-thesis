"""
The problem is asking to create a function that checks if a given string has an 'a' followed by exactly three 'b's.
However, there seems to be a missing condition in the problem statement. 

Thanks to the provided unit test `assert not text_match_three("ac")`, we can infer that the function should return True only if the string starts with 'a' and has exactly three 'b's after it. If the string does not meet these conditions, the function should return False.

Here's a Python solution for the problem:

```
def text_match_three(text):
    if len(text) < 4:
        return False
    if text[0] != 'a':
        return False
    if text[1:4] != 'bb':
        return False
    return True
```

This function first checks if the length of the string is less than 4. If it is, the function returns False because a string of length less than 4 cannot have an 'a' followed by three 'b's. Then, it checks if the first character of the string is 'a'. If it is not, the function returns False. Finally, it checks if the characters from the second to the fourth position (inclusive) are 'bb'. If they are not, the function returns False. If the string passes all these checks, the function returns True. """
