The problem is asking you to write a function that finds the closest smaller number than the given number `n`. For example, if `n` is 11, the function should return 10.

Here's a Python function that solves this problem:
```
def closest_num(n):
    return n - 1
```
This function works by simply subtracting 1 from the input number `n`. This is because the closest smaller number than `n` is always `n - 1`. For example, if `n` is 11, `n - 1` is 10, which is the closest smaller number to 11.

The unit test `assert closest_num(11) == 10` confirms that this function works correctly. It checks that when the input is 11, the function returns 10, which is the correct result.
