The problem is asking to write a function that finds the closest smaller number than a given number n. 

However, the problem description does not specify whether the closest smaller number should be to the left or to the right of n in the number line. 

Fortunately, the unit test `assert closest_num(11) == 10` provides a hint. It suggests that the closest smaller number is to the left of n. 

Here is a Python function that solves the problem:
```
def closest_num(n):
    return n - 1
```
This function simply returns the number n minus 1, which is the closest smaller number to the left of n. 

This function passes the given unit test:
```
assert closest_num(11) == 10
```
