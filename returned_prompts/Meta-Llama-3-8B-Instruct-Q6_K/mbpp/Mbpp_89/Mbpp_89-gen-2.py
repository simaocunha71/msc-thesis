The problem is asking for a function that finds the closest smaller number than a given number n. 

The unit test `assert closest_num(11) == 10` suggests that the function should return the largest number that is smaller than n. 

Here is a Python solution for this problem:

```
def closest_num(n):
    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        if i < n:
            return i
```

This function works by iterating from n-1 down to 1 (inclusive) and returning the first number that is smaller than n. The `range` function is used to generate the sequence of numbers, and the `if` statement is used to check if the current number is smaller than n. If it is, the function returns the number. 

For example, if you call `closest_num(11)`, the function will iterate from 10 down to 1, and return 10 because it is the largest number that is smaller than 11.
