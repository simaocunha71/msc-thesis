The problem is asking to write a function that finds the closest smaller number than the given number n. 

However, the problem doesn't specify what to do if there are multiple closest smaller numbers. 

Thanks to the unit test `assert closest_num(11) == 10`, we can assume that if there are multiple closest smaller numbers, we return the one that is closer to the right.

Here is a Python solution for the problem:

```Python
def closest_num(n):
    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        if i < n:
            return i
```

This function iterates from n-1 down to 1, and returns the first number it finds that is smaller than n. This is the closest smaller number to n. If there are multiple closest smaller numbers, it will return the one that is closer to the right. 

For example, if n is 11, the function will return 10, which is the closest smaller number to 11. If n is 10, the function will return 9, which is the closest smaller number to 10. And so on.
