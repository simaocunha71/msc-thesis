def rear_extract(tuples_list):
    return [x[-1] for x in tuples_list]  # Using list comprehension to extract the rear element of each tuple. The -1 index refers to the last element in each tuple.  # Return the list of rear elements.  # Example usage:  # print(rear_extract([(1, 'Rash', 21), (2, 'Varsha', 20), (3, 'Kil', 19)]))  # Output: [21, 20, 19]  # Time complexity: O(n)  # Space complexity: O(n)  # Where n is the number of tuples in the input list.  # The function iterates over each tuple once, which results in a linear time complexity.  # The function also stores the rear elements in a new list, which results in a linear space complexity.  # Therefore, the overall time and space complexity is O(n).  # This function is efficient for large inputs as it only needs to iterate over each tuple once and store the results in a new list.  # However, it may not be efficient for very large inputs if the input list is too large to fit into memory, as it requires storing the entire list in memory.  # In such cases, an in-place algorithm may be more suitable.  # For example, you could use a heap data structure to efficiently find the maximum element in the list without storing the entire list in memory.  # This would result in a more efficient algorithm with a time complexity of O(n log n) and a space complexity of O(1).  # However, this would also make the code more complex and harder to understand.  # Therefore, the choice of algorithm depends on the specific requirements of the problem and the constraints of the input data.  # In this case, the list is not too large to fit into memory, so the simple and efficient solution is to use list comprehension.  # However, if the list was too large to fit into memory, a more complex algorithm using a heap data structure would be more suitable.  # This is a trade-off between simplicity and efficiency, and the choice of algorithm depends on the specific requirements of the problem.  # For example, if the input list is too large to fit into memory, you could use a generator expression instead of a list comprehension, which would allow you to process the list in chunks without storing the entire list in memory.  # This would result in a more
