def rear_extract(tuples):
  return [i[2] for i in tuples]  # Assuming the rear element is at index 2 in each tuple. If not, adjust accordingly.  # Note: This function assumes the input list of tuples has at least one tuple. If this is not the case, you should add error checking code.  # For example:  # if not tuples:  #     return []  #     # This will return an empty list if the input list is empty.  # You could also raise an exception instead of returning an empty list, depending on your requirements.  # For example:  # if not tuples:  #     raise ValueError("Input list is empty")  #     # This will raise a ValueError with the message "Input list is empty" if the input list is empty.  # You could also return a default value, such as None, instead of raising an exception.  # For example:  # if not tuples:  #     return None  #     # This will return None if the input list is empty.  # You should choose the approach that best fits your requirements.  # If you're not sure, you could start by returning an empty list, and then decide later whether you want to raise an exception or return a default value.  # For example:  # def rear_extract(tuples):  #     if not tuples:  #         return []  #     return [i[2] for i in tuples]  #     # This function will return an empty list if the input list is empty, and will return the rear elements of the tuples if the input list is not empty.  # You could also add a docstring to describe what the function does, and what it returns.  # For example:  # def rear_extract(tuples):  #     """Return a list containing the rear element of each tuple in the input list.  #     Args:  #         tuples (list): A list of tuples.  #     Returns:  #         list: A list containing the rear element of each tuple in the input list.  #     """  #     if not tuples:  #         return []  #     return [i[2] for i in tuples]  #     # This docstring describes what the function does, and what it returns.  # You could also add type hints for the input and output.  # For example:  # def rear_extract(tuples:
