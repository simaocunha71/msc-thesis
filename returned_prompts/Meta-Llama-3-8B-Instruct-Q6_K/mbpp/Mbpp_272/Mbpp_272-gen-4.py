```
def rear_extract(tuples):
    return [i[2] for i in tuples]
```


The problem is asking to write a function that takes a list of tuples as input and returns a new list containing the third element of each tuple. 

The given unit test `assert rear_extract([(1, 'Rash', 21), (2, 'Varsha', 20), (3, 'Kil', 19)]) == [21, 20, 19]` suggests that the tuples represent people with their id, name and age, and the function should return a list of ages.

Here is the solution in Python:

```Python
def rear_extract(tuples):
    return [i[2] for i in tuples]
```

This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each tuple in the input list, and for each tuple, it returns the third element (at index 2). The resulting list of ages is then returned. 

For example, if the input is `[(1, 'Rash', 21), (2, 'Varsha', 20), (3, 'Kil', 19)]`, the function will return `[21, 20, 19]`. 

This solution assumes that all tuples have at least three elements and that the third element is the age. If this is not the case, the function may raise an IndexError or return incorrect results. 

In a real-world application, you might want to add error handling to ensure that the tuples have at least three elements and that the third element is the age. 

Here is an example of how you could add error handling:

```Python
def rear_extract(tuples):
    result = []
    for i in tuples:
        if len(i) >= 3:
            result.append(i[2])
        else:
            raise ValueError("Tuple must have at least three elements")
    return result
```


This version of the function will raise a ValueError if any tuple has fewer than three elements. You could also add a check to ensure that the third element is an integer, if that is a requirement for the age. 

Here is an example of how you could add a check for the age:

```Python
def rear_extract(tuples):
    result = []
    for i in tuples:
        if len(i) >= 3:
            if isinstance(i[2], int):
                result.append(i[2])
            else:
                raise ValueError("Age must be an integer")
        else:
            raise
