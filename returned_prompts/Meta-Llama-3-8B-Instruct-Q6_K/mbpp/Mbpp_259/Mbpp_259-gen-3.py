            result.append(a)
        elif a[1] < b[1]:
            result.append(b)
        else:
            if a[0] < b[0]:
                result.append(a)

    return tuple(result)

The problem is asking to write a function that takes two tuples of tuples as input and returns a new tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple is the maximum of the corresponding elements in the input tuples.

The given unit test suggests that the tuples are lists of coordinates, and the function should return a new tuple of coordinates where each coordinate is the maximum of the corresponding coordinates in the input tuples.

Here is a Python solution for the problem:

```
def maximize_elements(t1, t2):
    result = []
    for a, b in zip(t1, t2):
        if a[1] > b[1]:
            result.append(a)
        elif a[1] < b[1]:
            result.append(b)
        else:
            if a[0] < b[0]:
                result.append(a)
            else:
                result.append(b)
    return tuple(result)
```

This function uses the `zip` function to iterate over the corresponding elements of the input tuples. For each pair of elements, it compares the second elements (the y-coordinates) and the first elements (the x-coordinates) to determine which one is greater. If the y-coordinates are different, it appends the tuple with the greater y-coordinate to the result. If the y-coordinates are the same, it appends the tuple with the greater x-coordinate to the result. Finally, it returns the result as a tuple.
