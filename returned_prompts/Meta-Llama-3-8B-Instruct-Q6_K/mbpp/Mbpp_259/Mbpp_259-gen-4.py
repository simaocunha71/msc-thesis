```
def maximize_elements(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(max(x, y) for x, y in zip(tup1, tup2))
```


The task is to create a function that takes two tuples of tuples as input and returns a new tuple of tuples where each inner tuple contains the maximum value from the corresponding inner tuples in the input tuples.

The problem statement does not specify the type of values in the tuples. However, based on the provided unit test, it can be assumed that the tuples contain integers. The unit test is:

assert maximize_elements(((1, 3), (4, 5), (2, 9), (1, 10)), ((6, 7), (3, 9), (1, 1), (7, 3))) == ((6, 7), (4, 9), (2, 9), (7, 10))

The function `maximize_elements` takes two tuples of tuples as input and returns a new tuple of tuples. It uses the built-in `zip` function to iterate over the inner tuples in the input tuples and the `max` function to find the maximum value for each pair of values.

Here is the solution:
```
def maximize_elements(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(max(x, y) for x, y in zip(tup1, tup2))
```

This function works by using a generator expression to iterate over the inner tuples in the input tuples. For each pair of values, it uses the `max` function to find the maximum value and returns a new tuple of tuples containing the maximum values. The `zip` function is used to iterate over the inner tuples in the input tuples in parallel. The `tuple` function is used to convert the generator expression to a tuple.
