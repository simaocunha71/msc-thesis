```
def maximize_elements(tuples1, tuples2):
    result = []
    for t1, t2 in zip(tuples1, tuples2):
        if t1[1] > t2[1]:
            result.append(t1)
        else:
            result.append(t2)
    return tuple(result)
```


The function `maximize_elements` takes two tuples of tuples as input. Each inner tuple represents a pair of elements. The function compares each pair of elements and adds the element with the larger second element to the result. The result is returned as a tuple of tuples.

In the given example, the function compares the pairs (1, 3) and (6, 7), (4, 5) and (3, 9), (2, 9) and (1, 1), (1, 10) and (7, 3). The result is ((6, 7), (4, 9), (2, 9), (7, 10)), which is the maximum possible combination.
