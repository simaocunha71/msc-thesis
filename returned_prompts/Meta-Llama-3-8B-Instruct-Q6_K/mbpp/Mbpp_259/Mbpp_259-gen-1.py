The task is to create a function that takes two tuples of tuples as input. Each inner tuple represents a pair of elements where the first element is the key and the second element is the value. The function should return a new tuple of tuples where each inner tuple is the maximum pair based on the key and the value. If the keys are equal, the maximum pair is the one with the greater value.

Here's an example of how the function should work:
```
assert maximize_elements(((1, 3), (4, 5), (2, 9), (1, 10)), ((6, 7), (3, 9), (1, 1), (7, 3))) == ((6, 7), (4, 9), (2, 9), (7, 10))
```

The unit test provided helps to clarify the problem by showing the expected output for a given input. Based on this, we can write the function to solve the problem. The function iterates over the input tuples, comparing the keys and values of each pair. If the key is greater in the first tuple, it is added to the result. If the key is greater in the second tuple, it is also added to the result. If the keys are equal, the pair with the greater value is added to the result. Finally, the last pair from the second tuple is added to the result to ensure that it is included in the output. The function returns the resulting tuple of tuples.
