This function takes two tuples of tuples as input and returns a new tuple of tuples. Each inner tuple represents two elements, the first element of the first tuple and the second element of the second tuple. The function compares the elements and places the element with the maximum value in the corresponding position in the result tuple. If the elements are equal, it places the element with the larger second value in the result tuple. The function uses the zip function to iterate over the corresponding elements of the input tuples. The result is returned as a tuple. The unit test provided ensures that the function works correctly for the given input.
