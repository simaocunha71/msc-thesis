```
def maximize_elements(t1, t2):
    return tuple(max(x, y) for x, y in zip(t1, t2))
```


The problem asks to create a function that takes two tuples of tuples as input and returns a new tuple of tuples where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements in the input tuples.

The given unit test `assert maximize_elements(((1, 3), (4, 5), (2, 9), (1, 10)), ((6, 7), (3, 9), (1, 1), (7, 3))) == ((6, 7), (4, 9), (2, 9), (7, 10))` helps to understand the problem better.

The solution is to use the built-in `max` function with the `zip` function to iterate over the two tuples in parallel. The `max` function returns the maximum of the two elements at each position, and the `zip` function returns an iterator of tuples, where each tuple contains one element from each of the argument sequences.

Here is the solution:
```
def maximize_elements(t1, t2):
    return tuple(max(x, y) for x, y in zip(t1, t2))
```
This function takes two tuples `t1` and `t2` as input, and returns a new tuple of tuples where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements in `t1` and `t2`. The `zip` function is used to iterate over the two tuples in parallel, and the `max` function is used to find the maximum of each pair of elements. The `tuple` function is used to convert the iterator of tuples returned by the `zip` function into a tuple of tuples.
