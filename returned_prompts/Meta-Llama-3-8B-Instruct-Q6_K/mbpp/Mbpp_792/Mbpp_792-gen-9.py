```
def count_list(lists):
    return len(lists)
```
Explanation:
The problem is asking to write a function that takes a list of lists as an argument and returns the number of lists in the given list of lists. 

The unit test provided, `assert count_list([[1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]) == 4`, suggests that the function should count the number of lists in the given list of lists.

In Python, we can use the built-in `len` function to get the number of elements in a list. Therefore, the solution is simply `def count_list(lists): return len(lists)`, which returns the number of lists in the given list of lists.
