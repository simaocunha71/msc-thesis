The problem is asking to count the number of lists in a given number of lists. However, the problem statement is unclear about the input type. 

Thanks to the unit test provided, we can assume that the input is a list of lists. The function would then count the number of inner lists.

Here is the Python function to solve the problem:

```
def count_list(lists):
    return len(lists)
```

This function takes a list of lists as input and returns the number of inner lists. The unit test `assert count_list([[1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]) == 4` also suggests that the function should return 4 for the given input, which is the correct number of inner lists.
