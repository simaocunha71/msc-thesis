```
def count_list(lists):
    return len(lists)
```

The problem asks to write a Python function that counts the number of lists in a given number of lists. 

However, the problem description seems to be missing some information. It appears that the function should take a list of lists as an argument and return the count of the inner lists. 

Fortunately, the unit test `assert count_list([[1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]) == 4` provides more context. It suggests that the function should count the number of inner lists in the given list of lists.

The solution is straightforward. We can use the built-in `len` function to count the number of elements in the given list of lists. This will give us the count of inner lists. 

Here's the Python function that solves the problem:
```
def count_list(lists):
    return len(lists)
```
This function takes a list of lists as an argument and returns the count of the inner lists. The unit test `assert count_list([[1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]) == 4` passes with this function.
