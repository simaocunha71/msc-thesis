```
def count_list(lists):
    return len(lists)
```



Explanation:
The problem is asking to create a function that counts the number of lists in a given number of lists. The function should take a list of lists as an argument and return the count of lists. 

For example, if the input is `[[1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]`, the output should be `4` because there are 4 lists.

The unit test provided is `assert count_list([[1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]) == 4`, which helps to clarify the problem.

The solution is a simple function that uses the built-in `len` function to count the number of elements in the input list, which are the lists themselves. 

Here's the code:
```
def count_list(lists):
    return len(lists)
```
This function takes a list of lists as an argument and returns the count of lists. The `len` function is used to count the number of elements in the input list, which are the lists themselves. For example, if the input is `[[1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]`, the function will return `4` because there are 4 lists.
