```
def count_list(lists):
    return len(lists)
```
The problem is asking to write a function that takes a number of lists as input and returns the count of those lists. 

The unit test provided, `assert count_list([[1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]) == 4`, suggests that the input is a list of lists, and the function should return the number of inner lists.

The solution is straightforward. We can simply use the built-in `len` function in Python, which returns the number of items in an object. In this case, we pass the list of lists as an argument to the function, and `len` returns the number of inner lists. 

For example, `count_list([[1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]])` returns `4`, which is the correct count of inner lists. 





```
def count_list(lists):
    return len(lists)

assert count_list([[1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]) == 4
```
The above code is the solution to the problem. The function `count_list` takes a list of lists as input and returns the count of those lists. The unit test `assert count_list([[1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]) == 4` ensures that the function returns the correct count.
