def count_list(lists):
    return len(lists)
```


The function `count_list` takes a list of lists as an argument and returns the number of lists in the given number of lists. In this case, it simply returns the length of the input list. The unit test `assert count_list([[1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]) == 4` verifies that the function returns the correct count.
