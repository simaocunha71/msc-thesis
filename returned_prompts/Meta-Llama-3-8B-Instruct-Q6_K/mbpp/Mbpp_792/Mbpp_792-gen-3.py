```
def count_list(lists):
    return len(lists)
```
The function `count_list` takes a list of lists as an argument and returns the number of lists in the given list of lists. 

For example, if the input is `[[1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]`, the function will return `4`, which is the number of lists in the input. 

The unit test `assert count_list([[1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]) == 4` ensures that the function is working correctly. 

The function simply uses the built-in `len` function to get the number of elements in the input list, which are the lists themselves. 
So, `len(lists)` returns the number of lists in the input. 
The function does not need to iterate over the input list or use any other complex logic. 
It is a simple and efficient solution.
