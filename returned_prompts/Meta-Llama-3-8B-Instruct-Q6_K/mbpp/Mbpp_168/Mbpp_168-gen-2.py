```
def frequency(lst, num):
    return lst.count(num)
```


In this problem, we need to write a function that counts the number of occurrences of a given number in a list. The function takes two parameters: the list and the number to be counted. 

The unit test `assert frequency([1,2,3], 4) == 0` suggests that if the number is not present in the list, the function should return 0. 

We can solve this problem by using the built-in `count` method of the list data type in Python, which returns the number of occurrences of the specified element in the list. If the number is not present in the list, it will return 0. 

Here is the solution:
```
def frequency(lst, num):
    return lst.count(num)
```


This function takes a list `lst` and a number `num` as input, and returns the number of occurrences of `num` in `lst`. If `num` is not present in `lst`, it will return 0. 

For example, if we call `frequency([1,2,3], 4)`, it will return 0, because 4 is not present in the list. If we call `frequency([1,2,3,2], 2)`, it will return 2, because 2 is present twice in the list.  If we call `frequency([1,2,3,4,4,4], 4)`, it will return 3, because 4 is present three times in the list.  If we call `frequency([], 5)`, it will return 0, because 5 is not present in the empty list.  And so on.  This function is very efficient and easy to use.  It is also easy to understand and maintain.  It does exactly what it is supposed to do, and it does it well.  It is a good example of how to solve a common problem in Python.
