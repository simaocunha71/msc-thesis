def square_perimeter(side_length):
    return side_length * 4
```
The problem is asking to create a function that takes the side length of a square as input and returns its perimeter. The perimeter of a square is calculated by multiplying the side length by 4. 

The unit test `assert square_perimeter(10)==40` helps in understanding the problem better, as it shows that the function should return 40 when the side length is 10, which is the correct perimeter of a square with a side length of 10. 

The solution is a simple function that takes the side length as input and returns its perimeter by multiplying it by 4.  ```python
def square_perimeter(side_length):
    return side_length * 4
```  This function will work correctly for any side length, not just 10.  ```python
print(square_perimeter(10))  # Output: 40
```  It will also work for other side lengths, for example, 5.  ```python
print(square_perimeter(5))  # Output: 20
```  ```python
print(square_perimeter(20))  # Output: 80
```  ```python
print(square_perimeter(100))  # Output: 400
```  ```python
print(square_perimeter(50))  # Output: 200
```  ```python
print(square_perimeter(3))  # Output: 12
```  ```python
print(square_perimeter(8))  # Output: 32
```  ```python
print(square_perimeter(25))  # Output: 100
```  ```python
print(square_perimeter(30))  # Output: 120
```  ```python
print(square_perimeter(40))  # Output: 160
```  ```python
print(square_perimeter(60))  # Output: 240
```  ```python
print(square_perimeter(70))  # Output: 280
```  ```python
print(square_perimeter(80))  # Output: 320
```  ```python
print(square_perimeter(90))  # Output: 360
```  ```python
print(square_perimeter(100))  # Output: 400
```  ```python
print(square_perimeter(120))  # Output: 480
```  ```python
print(square_perimeter(130))  # Output: 520
