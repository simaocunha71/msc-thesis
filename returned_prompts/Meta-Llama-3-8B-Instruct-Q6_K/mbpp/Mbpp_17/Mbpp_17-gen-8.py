```
def square_perimeter(side_length):
    return side_length * 4
```


This function takes in the side length of a square and returns its perimeter. The perimeter of a square is calculated by multiplying the side length by 4. This is because a square has all sides of equal length, so the perimeter is just the side length multiplied by the number of sides, which is 4. The unit test `assert square_perimeter(10)==40` helps to verify the correctness of the function.
