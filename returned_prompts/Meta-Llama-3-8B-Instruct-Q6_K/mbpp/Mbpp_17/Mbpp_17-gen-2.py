```
def square_perimeter(side_length):
    return side_length * 4
```


The problem is asking to create a function that calculates the perimeter of a square given its side length. The perimeter of a square is calculated by multiplying the side length by 4.

The unit test `assert square_perimeter(10)==40` helps to clarify that the function should return the perimeter of the square, which is 40 in this case since the side length is 10.

Here is the Python solution:
```
def square_perimeter(side_length):
    return side_length * 4
```
This function takes the side length as input and returns the perimeter of the square, which is the side length multiplied by 4. The unit test `assert square_perimeter(10)==40` confirms that the function works correctly.
