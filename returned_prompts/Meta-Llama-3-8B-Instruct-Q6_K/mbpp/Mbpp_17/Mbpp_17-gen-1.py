```
def square_perimeter(side_length):
    return 4 * side_length
```


The problem is asking for a function that calculates the perimeter of a square given its side length. 

The unit test `assert square_perimeter(10)==40` suggests that the function should return 4 times the side length, which is the correct formula for the perimeter of a square.

Here is a Python function that solves the problem:

```
def square_perimeter(side_length):
    return 4 * side_length
```


This function takes a side length as input and returns the perimeter of the square. The perimeter is calculated by multiplying the side length by 4. 

For example, if the side length is 10, the function will return 40, which is the perimeter of a square with side length 10. 

The function passes the given unit test, which checks that the function returns 40 when the side length is 10.
