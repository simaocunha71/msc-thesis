def square_perimeter(side_length):
    return 4 * side_length
```
The problem is asking to create a function that calculates the perimeter of a square given its side length as input. The perimeter of a square is calculated by multiplying the side length by 4.

The unit test `assert square_perimeter(10)==40` helps to clarify the problem by providing an example of the expected output for a given input. 

The solution is a simple function that takes the side length as input and returns the perimeter, which is calculated by multiplying the side length by 4. 

This solution passes the given unit test, as the perimeter of a square with a side length of 10 is indeed 40 (4 * 10).
