```
def find_remainder(arr, n):
    product = 1
    for num in arr:
        product *= num % n
    return product % n
```
The problem asks to write a function that finds the product of the array elements and then takes the remainder of that product when divided by `n`. 

The given unit test `assert find_remainder([ 100, 10, 5, 25, 35, 14 ],11) ==9` helps to understand the problem better. It suggests that the problem wants the product of the array elements modulo `n`, not the product of the remainders modulo `n`. 

In the solution, we calculate the product of the array elements and then take the remainder of that product when divided by `n`. This is done by initializing a variable `product` to 1, then iterating over the array and multiplying `product` by each element modulo `n`. Finally, we return the remainder of `product` when divided by `n`. 
```python
def find_remainder(arr, n):
    product = 1
    for num in arr:
        product *= num % n
    return product % n
``` 
This solution passes the given unit test. 
```python
assert find_remainder([ 100, 10, 5, 25, 35, 14 ],11) ==9
