```
def find_remainder(arr, n):
    result = 1
    for num in arr:
        result = (result * num) % n
    return result
```
The problem asks you to write a function that calculates the product of the elements in an array and then returns the remainder of this product divided by a given number `n`. 

The provided unit test `assert find_remainder([ 100, 10, 5, 25, 35, 14 ],11) ==9` suggests that the array can contain any positive integer and `n` can be any positive integer. 

We can use the built-in modulus operator `%` to calculate the remainder of the product divided by `n`. The product is initialized to 1 and then updated in each iteration of the loop, which goes through each element in the array. 

Here is the Python function that solves the problem:
```
def find_remainder(arr, n):
    result = 1
    for num in arr:
        result = (result * num) % n
    return result
``` 





The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because the function iterates over each element in the array once. The space complexity is O(1), which means the space required does not change with the size of the input array, because the function only uses a constant amount of space to store the result. 





The function is easy to understand and implement, and it works correctly for any positive integer array and any positive integer `n`. 





The unit test `assert find_remainder([ 100, 10, 5, 25, 35, 14 ],11) ==9` passes, which confirms that the function is working correctly. 





Therefore, the provided function is a correct solution to the problem. 





This solution is also efficient, as it only requires a single pass over the array and uses a constant amount of space. 





It is also easy to understand and implement, making it a good solution for this problem. 





This function can be used in any situation where you need to calculate the product of an array of numbers and then find the remainder of this product divided by a given number. 





It is a versatile and useful function that can be applied in a wide range of applications. 





For example, it can be used in cryptography to calculate the remainder of the product of a set of
