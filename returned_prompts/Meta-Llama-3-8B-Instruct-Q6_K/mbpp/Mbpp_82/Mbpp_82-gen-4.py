```
import math

def volume_sphere(radius):
    volume = (4/3) * math.pi * (radius ** 3)
    return volume
```



The problem is asking for a function that calculates the volume of a sphere given its radius. The formula for the volume of a sphere is (4/3) * Ï€ * r^3, where r is the radius of the sphere.

The unit test `assert math.isclose(volume_sphere(10), 4188.790204786391, rel_tol=0.001)` suggests that the function should return the volume of a sphere with a radius of 10, which is approximately 4188.790204786391.

Here is the solution:
```
import math

def volume_sphere(radius):
    volume = (4/3) * math.pi * (radius ** 3)
    return volume
```
This function takes the radius of the sphere as input and returns its volume. The formula for the volume of a sphere is used to calculate the volume. The `math.pi` constant is used to get the value of pi. The `**` operator is used to raise the radius to the power of 3. The result is returned as the volume of the sphere.
