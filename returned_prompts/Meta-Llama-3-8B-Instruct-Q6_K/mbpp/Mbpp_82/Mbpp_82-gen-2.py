```
import math

def volume_sphere(radius):
    return (4/3) * math.pi * (radius ** 3)
```


The problem is asking to write a function that calculates the volume of a sphere given its radius. The formula for the volume of a sphere is (4/3) * π * r^3, where r is the radius of the sphere.

The unit test provided is `assert math.isclose(volume_sphere(10), 4188.790204786391, rel_tol=0.001)`, which means the function should return the volume of a sphere with a radius of 10. The expected result is approximately 4188.790204786391.

Here's the solution in Python:
```
import math

def volume_sphere(radius):
    return (4/3) * math.pi * (radius ** 3)
```
This function takes a radius as input and returns the volume of the sphere with that radius. The formula is implemented using the `**` operator for exponentiation and the `math.pi` constant for the mathematical constant π. The `import math` statement is used to import the `math` module, which provides the `pi` constant and other mathematical functions. The `assert` statement is used to test the function with a radius of 10 and an expected result of approximately 4188.790204786391. The `math.isclose` function is used to check if the result is close to the expected result within a relative tolerance of 0.001. If the result is close enough, the test passes; otherwise, it fails.
