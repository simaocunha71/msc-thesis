```
The problem is asking to write a function that calculates the volume of a sphere given its radius. The formula for the volume of a sphere is (4/3) * pi * (radius ** 3).

The unit test provided helps to ensure that the function is working correctly. The test checks if the calculated volume of a sphere with a radius of 10 is close to the expected value of 4188.790204786391. The `math.isclose` function is used to compare the calculated volume with the expected value, which takes into account the floating-point precision.

The function `volume_sphere` takes a single argument `radius` and returns the calculated volume of the sphere. The `math.pi` constant is used to get the value of pi. The `**` operator is used to raise the radius to the power of 3. The result is then multiplied by the fraction (4/3) to get the final volume.
