import math

def volume_sphere(radius):
    return (4/3) * math.pi * (radius ** 3)
```


The problem is asking you to create a function that calculates the volume of a sphere given its radius. 

The formula to calculate the volume of a sphere is (4/3) * π * r^3, where r is the radius of the sphere.

The unit test provided in the problem ensures that the function works correctly for a sphere with a radius of 10. This test checks that the calculated volume is close to the expected volume, with a relative tolerance of 0.001.

Here is the solution:
```
import math

def volume_sphere(radius):
    return (4/3) * math.pi * (radius ** 3)
```
This function takes a radius as input and returns the calculated volume of the sphere. The `math.pi` constant is used to get the value of π, and the `**` operator is used to raise the radius to the power of 3. The result is then returned by the function.
