import math

def volume_sphere(radius):
    return (4/3) * math.pi * (radius ** 3)
```



The problem is asking you to write a function that calculates the volume of a sphere given its radius. The formula for the volume of a sphere is (4/3) * pi * r^3, where r is the radius of the sphere.

The unit test provided checks that the function returns the correct volume for a sphere with a radius of 10. It uses the `math.isclose` function to check that the result is close to the expected value, allowing for a small margin of error.

Here is the solution:
```
import math

def volume_sphere(radius):
    return (4/3) * math.pi * (radius ** 3)
```
This function takes a single argument `radius`, which is the radius of the sphere. It then returns the volume of the sphere calculated using the formula (4/3) * pi * r^3. The `math.pi` constant is used to represent the value of pi. The `**` operator is used to raise the radius to the power of 3. The result is returned as a floating point number.
