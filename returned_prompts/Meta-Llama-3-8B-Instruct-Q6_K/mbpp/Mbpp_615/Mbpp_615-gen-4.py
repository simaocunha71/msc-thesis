```
def average_tuple(t):
    result = []
    for i in t:
        result.append(sum(i) / len(i))
    return result
```    
    The unit test provided helps to clarify the problem. It seems that the problem is asking to find the average value of each tuple in a tuple of tuples. The average value is calculated by summing all the elements in the tuple and then dividing by the number of elements.

    The function `average_tuple` iterates over each tuple in the input tuple of tuples, calculates the average value for each tuple, and adds it to the result list. The function then returns the result list.

    The unit test `assert average_tuple(((10, 10, 10, 12), (30, 45, 56, 45), (81, 80, 39, 32), (1, 2, 3, 4)))==[30.5, 34.25, 27.0, 23.25]` helps to verify that the function is working correctly. It checks that the function returns the expected result for a given input. If the function is working correctly, the assertion will pass, and if not, it will raise an AssertionError.
