The problem is asking to create a function that takes a tuple of tuples as input and returns a list of average values, where each average value is calculated from the corresponding tuple.

The unit test provided helps in understanding the problem better. It shows that the input is a tuple of tuples and the function should return a list of average values.

Here is the Python solution for the problem:
```
def average_tuple(tuples):
    return [sum(i) / len(i) for i in tuples]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each tuple in the input tuple of tuples. For each tuple, it calculates the average value by summing all the values in the tuple and dividing by the number of values (which is the length of the tuple). The results are then returned as a list.
