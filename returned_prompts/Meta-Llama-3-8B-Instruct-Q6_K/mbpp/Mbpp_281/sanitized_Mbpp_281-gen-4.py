def all_unique(lst):
    return len(lst) == len(set(lst))
    # This function works by comparing the length of the list with the length of a set created from the list. 
    # If the lengths are equal, it means all elements in the list are unique, otherwise, there are duplicates.
    # The set data structure in python does not allow duplicate values, so it automatically removes any duplicates. 
    # Therefore, if the lengths are equal, the list must have been 'cleaned' of any duplicates. 
    # The function returns True if all elements are unique and False otherwise. 
    # It works for lists of any type, not just integers. 
    # For example, all_unique(['a', 'b', 'c']) would return True, while all_unique(['a', 'b', 'b']) would return False. 
    # It also works with lists of mixed types, such as all_unique([1, 'a', 2, 'b']). 
    # However, it does not work correctly with lists of mutable objects, such as lists or dictionaries. 
    # This is because these objects can be modified after they are added to the list, which means that the set would not accurately reflect the state of the list. 
    # For example, all_unique([{'a': 1}]) would return True, even though the list contains duplicate objects. 
    # To correctly check for uniqueness in lists of mutable objects, you would need to use a different approach. 
    # For example, you could use a dictionary to keep track of the objects you have seen, like this: 
    # def all_unique(lst): 
    #     seen = {} 
    #     for obj in lst: 
    #         if obj in seen: 
    #             return False 
    #         seen[obj] = True 
    #     return True 
    # This function would correctly identify duplicate objects in lists of mutable objects. 
    # However, it would be slower and more memory-intensive than the original function, especially for large lists. 
    # This is because it needs to store all the objects in memory, which can be a problem if the list is very large. 
    # In general, it is a good idea to use the original function unless you have a specific reason to use the alternative. 
    # The original function is simple, efficient, and works correctly for most types of lists. 
    # The alternative function is more complex
