def all_unique(lst):
    return len(lst) == len(set(lst))
```


Python code to check if the elements of a given list are unique or not. The function all_unique() takes a list as input and returns True if all elements in the list are unique, and False otherwise. The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. This is because the function iterates over the list once to convert it to a set, which takes linear time. The space complexity is also O(n), as the function creates a set of the unique elements in the list. The unit test provided in the problem description, assert all_unique([1,2,3]) == True, ensures that the function works correctly for a list of integers. This unit test can be extended to cover other types of lists and edge cases. For example, assert all_unique(['a', 'b', 'c']) == True, and assert all_unique([1,1,2,3]) == False. The function can be further improved by handling edge cases, such as an empty list, and by providing a meaningful error message if the input is not a list. For example, def all_unique(lst): if not isinstance(lst, list): raise TypeError("Input must be a list") if len(lst) == 0: return True return len(lst) == len(set(lst)) The unit tests can be extended to cover these edge cases. For example, assert all_unique([]) == True, and assert all_unique(123) == TypeError("Input must be a list"). The function can also be modified to return the unique elements in the list, instead of just checking if they are unique. This would require modifying the function to return the set of unique elements, and then converting it back to a list. For example, def all_unique(lst): if not isinstance(lst, list): raise TypeError("Input must be a list") if len(lst) == 0: return [] return list(set(lst)) The unit tests can be extended to cover this modified function. For example, assert all_unique([1,2,3]) == [1,2,3], and assert all_unique([1,1,2,3]) == [1,2,3]. The function can also be modified to handle duplicates in a specific way, such as by returning a list of the duplicates. This would require modifying the function to keep track of the duplicates, and then returning them in a list. For example
