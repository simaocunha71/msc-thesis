The Eulerian number a(n, m) is defined as the number of permutations of n items that have exactly m descents. 

In Python, you can use the following function to calculate the Eulerian number:

```
def eulerian_num(n, m):
    if m > n - 1:
        return 0
    else:
        return sum((-1)**i * math.comb(n-1, i) for i in range(m+1))
```
This function uses the formula for the Eulerian number: a(n, m) = Î£ (-1)^i * (n-1 choose i) for i from 0 to m. The math.comb function is used to calculate the binomial coefficient (n-1 choose i). 

The unit test `assert eulerian_num(3, 1) == 4` checks if the function returns the correct value for n=3 and m=1. 

Please note that you need to import the math module to use the math.comb function. You can do this by adding `import math` at the beginning of your code. 

Also, the math.comb function is available in Python 3.8 and later. If you are using an earlier version of Python, you can use the following formula to calculate the binomial coefficient: `math.comb(n, k) = math.factorial(n) // (math.factorial(k) * math.factorial(n-k))`. You can add this formula to the function to make it compatible with earlier versions of Python. 

Here is the modified function:

```
import math

def eulerian_num(n, m):
    if m > n - 1:
        return 0
    else:
        return sum((-1)**i * (math.factorial(n-1) // (math.factorial(i) * math.factorial(n-1-i))) for i in range(m+1))
```  # Corrected code
```
This function should work correctly for all versions of Python. 

Please note that the time complexity of this function is O(m) because it needs to iterate over the range(m+1) to calculate the sum. The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the variables. 

The function is efficient for small values of n and m, but it may be slow for large values because the binomial coefficient grows very fast. If you need to calculate the Eulerian number for large values of n and m
