```
def Find_Max(lst):
    return max(lst, key=len)
```
The function Find_Max takes a list of lists as input and returns the list with the maximum length. The built-in function max() is used with the key argument set to len, which tells max() to use the length of each list as the comparison criterion. The max() function then returns the list with the maximum length.

For example, if we call Find_Max([['A'],['A','B'],['A','B','C']]), it will return ['A','B','C'], which is the list with the maximum length.  This function works well for the given problem because it finds the list with the maximum length and returns it, which is what the problem is asking for. 

The unit test provided, assert Find_Max([['A'],['A','B'],['A','B','C']]) == ['A','B','C'], confirms that the function is working correctly.  It checks if the output of the function Find_Max([['A'],['A','B'],['A','B','C']]) is equal to ['A','B','C'].  If the function is working correctly, this assertion should pass, which it does.  This gives us confidence that the function is working as expected.  If the function were not working correctly, this assertion would fail, indicating that there is a problem with the function.  This is an important part of testing and debugging code, as it helps us catch errors and ensure that our code is working as expected.
