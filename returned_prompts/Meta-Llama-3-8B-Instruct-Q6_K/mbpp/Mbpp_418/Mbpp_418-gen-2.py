```
def Find_Max(lst):
    return max(lst, key=len)
```


Explanation:
The problem is asking to find the element in a list of lists that has the maximum length. The unit test provided is `assert Find_Max([['A'],['A','B'],['A','B','C']]) == ['A','B','C']`, which suggests that the function should return the list with the maximum length.

The solution uses the built-in `max` function in Python, which can be used to find the maximum value in a list. The `key` parameter of the `max` function is used to specify the criteria for comparison. In this case, we want to compare the lengths of the lists, so we use `len` as the key.

Here is the Python function:
```
def Find_Max(lst):
    return max(lst, key=len)
```
This function takes a list of lists as input and returns the list with the maximum length. The unit test provided in the problem is used to verify that the function is working correctly.
