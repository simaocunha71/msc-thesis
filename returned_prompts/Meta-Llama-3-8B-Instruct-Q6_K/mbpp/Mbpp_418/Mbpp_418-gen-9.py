```
def Find_Max(lst):
    return max(lst, key=len)
```
Explanation:
The problem is asking to write a function that finds the element of a list having maximum length. 

The unit test `assert Find_Max([['A'],['A','B'],['A','B','C']]) == ['A','B','C']` suggests that the list contains lists of strings. 

The `max` function in Python can be used with the `key` parameter to specify a function to be called on each list to determine its sort order. In this case, the key is the `len` function, which returns the length of each list. 

So, the function `Find_Max` returns the list with the maximum length. 

For example, `Find_Max([['A'],['A','B'],['A','B','C']])` returns `['A','B','C']` which is the list with the maximum length. 

This function will work correctly even if the list contains lists with different lengths. It will return the list with the maximum length. 

It's also worth noting that this function will return the first list with the maximum length if there are multiple lists with the same maximum length. If you want to return all lists with the maximum length, you would need a different approach.
