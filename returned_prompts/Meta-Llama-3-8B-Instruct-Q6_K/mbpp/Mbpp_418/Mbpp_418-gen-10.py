```
def Find_Max(lst):
    max_len = max(len(i) for i in lst)
    return max(i for i in lst if len(i) == max_len)
```
The function `Find_Max` takes a list of lists as an argument. It first finds the maximum length of the lists in the input list using the `max` function with a generator expression. Then it uses a generator expression again to find the first list in the input list that has this maximum length and returns it. If there are multiple lists with the same maximum length, it returns the first one it finds.

This function passes the given unit test:
```
assert Find_Max([['A'],['A','B'],['A','B','C']]) == ['A','B','C']
```  Python
```
This function works by first finding the maximum length of the lists in the input list, and then finding the first list that has this maximum length. It returns this list. If there are multiple lists with the same maximum length, it returns the first one it finds. This is because the `max` function in Python returns the first maximum value it encounters if there are multiple maximum values.

The function is tested with the unit test:
```
assert Find_Max([['A'],['A','B'],['A','B','C']]) == ['A','B','C']
```
This test checks that the function correctly returns the list with the maximum length when there is only one such list. It does not check what happens if there are multiple lists with the same maximum length. However, the function is designed to return the first such list it finds, so it will pass this test even if there are multiple lists with the same maximum length.  Python

def Find_Max(lst):
    max_len = max(len(i) for i in lst)
    return max(i for i in lst if len(i) == max_len)
