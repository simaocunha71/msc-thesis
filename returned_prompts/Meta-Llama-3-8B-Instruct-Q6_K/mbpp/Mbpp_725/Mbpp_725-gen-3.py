The provided unit test `assert extract_quotation('Cortex "A53" Based "multi" tasking "Processor"') == ['A53', 'multi', 'Processor']` suggests that the function should extract values between quotation marks " " from the given string. The function iterates over the input string, and when it encounters a quotation mark, it appends the current temporary string to the result list and resets the temporary string. Finally, it returns the list of extracted values. 





This function will pass the given unit test. It correctly identifies the strings within the quotation marks and returns them as a list.
