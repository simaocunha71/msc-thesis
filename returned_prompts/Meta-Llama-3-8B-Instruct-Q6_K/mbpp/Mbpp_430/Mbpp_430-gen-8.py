The directrix of a parabola is given by the equation y = -1/4p, where p is the focal length. 

Here, we are given the focal length, so we can directly calculate the directrix. 

In the unit test, we have p = 2 and the x-coordinate of the vertex is 3, but this information is not necessary to calculate the directrix.

Here is the Python function:

```
def parabola_directrix(p, x, y):
    return -1/4*p
```
