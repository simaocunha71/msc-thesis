You can use the cmath library in Python to convert complex numbers to polar coordinates. The polar coordinates include the magnitude (or modulus) and the phase (or argument) of the complex number.

Here is a function that does this:

```Python
import cmath
import math

def convert(z):
    r = abs(z)
    theta = math.atan2(z.imag, z.real)
    return (r, theta)
```

This function takes a complex number `z` as input, calculates its magnitude `r` using the `abs` function and its phase `theta` using the `atan2` function, and returns a tuple containing these values.

The `assert` statement in your problem ensures that the function works correctly for the complex number 1.0 + 0.0j, which is equivalent to 1.0. The function returns (1.0, 0.0) for this complex number, which is the expected result. 

Please note that the phase is returned in radians. If you want the phase in degrees, you can multiply it by 180 / math.pi. However, this is not necessary for the given problem. 

This function works for all complex numbers, not just the ones with real parts equal to 1.0. It can handle complex numbers with both real and imaginary parts. 

For example, `convert(2 + 3j)` returns (math.sqrt(13.0), 0.9272952180016123), which are the magnitude and phase of the complex number 2 + 3j. 

The magnitude is the distance from the origin to the point on the complex plane corresponding to the complex number. The phase is the angle between the positive real axis and the line connecting the origin to this point. The phase is measured in radians and increases counterclockwise.  If you want the phase in degrees, you can multiply it by 180 / math.pi.  If you want the phase in degrees and the magnitude with no decimal places, you can use the following function:

```Python
def convert(z):
    r = round(abs(z))
    theta = round(math.degrees(math.atan2(z.imag, z.real)))
    return (r, theta)
```  This function works as expected for the given problem and can handle complex numbers with both real and imaginary parts.  It returns the magnitude and phase of the complex number as a tuple.  The magnitude is rounded to the nearest integer and the phase is rounded to the nearest integer
