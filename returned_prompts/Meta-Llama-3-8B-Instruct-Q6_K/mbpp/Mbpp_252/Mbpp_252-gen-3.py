```
def convert(c):
    r = abs(c)
    theta = cmath.phase(c)
    return (r, theta)
```


In this function, we use the cmath module to get the absolute value of the complex number (which gives the radius) and the phase (which gives the angle). The cmath module provides functions to handle complex numbers. The `cmath.phase(c)` function returns the phase angle in radians. The `cmath.abs(c)` function returns the absolute value of the complex number. We then return the radius and phase as a tuple. The unit test `assert convert(1) == (1.0, 0.0)` checks if the function works correctly for real numbers, which should return the radius and phase as (1.0, 0.0).  If the input is a complex number, the function will return the radius and phase correctly.  If the input is a real number, the function will return the radius and phase correctly.  This function works for both real and complex numbers.  



Note: This function will work for both complex and real numbers. It will return the radius and phase for complex numbers and the radius and phase for real numbers. The radius will be the absolute value of the number and the phase will be the angle from the positive real axis. For real numbers, the phase will be 0.0.  



This function is a simple and efficient way to convert complex numbers to polar coordinates. It uses the built-in functions from the cmath module to get the absolute value and phase of the complex number. The function then returns the radius and phase as a tuple. The unit test checks if the function works correctly for real numbers, which should return the radius and phase as (1.0, 0.0).  



The function is also flexible and can handle complex numbers. The phase of a complex number is the angle from the positive real axis to the complex number in the complex plane. The absolute value of a complex number is the distance from the origin to the complex number in the complex plane. The function returns the radius and phase as a tuple, which can be used for further calculations or visualizations.  



Overall, this function is a simple and efficient way to convert complex numbers to polar coordinates and can be used in a variety of applications.  



Note: This function assumes that the input is a complex number. If the input is not a complex number, it will throw an error. You may want to add error checking
