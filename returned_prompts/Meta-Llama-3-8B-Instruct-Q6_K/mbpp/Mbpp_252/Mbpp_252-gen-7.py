    theta = math.atan2(c.imag, c.real)
    return r, theta

The problem is asking for a function that converts a complex number to its polar coordinates. In polar coordinates, a complex number is represented as a distance (radius) from the origin and an angle (theta) from the positive x-axis.

The radius (r) is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.

The angle (theta) is calculated using the arctangent function (atan2) with the imaginary part as the y-coordinate and the real part as the x-coordinate. This is because the arctangent function returns the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the point (x, y) in the plane.

The unit test `assert convert(1) == (1.0, 0.0)` ensures that the function works correctly for real numbers, which have a zero imaginary part and an angle of 0 radians. For complex numbers, the function will return the correct radius and angle.
