    for i in range(len(s)):
        if i > 0 and s[i].isupper():
            return False
        if i > 0 and s[i-1] == '_':

This function iterates over the input string. If it encounters an uppercase letter or a sequence that doesn't start with a lowercase letter after an underscore, it returns False. If it finishes the iteration without returning False, it returns True. 

The unit test `assert text_lowercase_underscore("aab_cbbbc")==(True)` ensures that the function works correctly. It checks if the string "aab_cbbbc" contains sequences of lowercase letters joined with an underscore, and the function should return True. 





Please note that the problem statement is unclear about whether a sequence of lowercase letters can be empty or not. However, based on the unit test provided, it seems that the function should return False for an empty string. Therefore, the function checks if the string is empty at the beginning and returns False if it is. This is also the expected behavior according to the unit test.
