The function `noprofit_noloss` checks whether the given `amount` has no profit and no loss by comparing the `cost` with the `amount`. If the `cost` is greater than the `amount`, it means there's a loss, so the function returns `False`. If the `cost` is not greater than the `amount`, it means there's no loss or no profit, so the function returns `True`.

In the unit test, `assert noprofit_noloss(1500,1200)==False`, the `amount` is 1500 and the `cost` is 1200, so the function returns `False` because there's a profit (1500 - 1200 = 300).  # or return cost == amount
