```
def noprofit_noloss(amount, cost):
    return amount >= cost
``` 
This function checks if the given amount is greater than or equal to the cost. If it is, it means there is no loss. If the amount is less than the cost, it means there is a loss. If the amount is equal to the cost, it means there is no profit and no loss. The function will return False if the amount is less than the cost, and True if the amount is greater than or equal to the cost. The unit test `assert noprofit_noloss(1500,1200)==False` will pass because the amount is greater than the cost, so there is a profit. 

The function does not need to check for no profit because if there is no loss, it means there is a profit. If there is a loss, the function will return False. If there is no profit, the function will return True. So, the function only needs to check for no loss. 

The function could also be written as `return amount > cost` because if the amount is equal to the cost, the function will still return True. But the original function is written as `return amount >= cost` to include the case where the amount is equal to the cost. 

The function does not need to handle the case where the cost is greater than the amount because the problem statement does not mention this case. If the cost is greater than the amount, it means the cost is more than the amount, which is not possible in real life. So, the function does not need to handle this case.  ```python
