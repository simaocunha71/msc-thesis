The given function `noprofit_noloss` checks whether the given cost is less than or equal to the sell price. If the cost is less than or equal to the sell price, it means there is no profit and no loss, otherwise, there is either profit or loss. The unit test `assert noprofit_noloss(1500,1200)==False` indicates that there is loss when the cost is more than the sell price. So, the function should return `False` in this case. The unit test `assert noprofit_noloss(1500,1500)==True` indicates that there is neither profit nor loss when the cost is equal to the sell price. So, the function should return `True` in this case. The unit test `assert noprofit_noloss(1200,1500)==True` indicates that there is no profit when the cost is less than the sell price. So, the function should return `True` in this case. 

The function should return `True` if there is no profit and no loss, otherwise, it should return `False`. The unit test `assert noprofit_noloss(1500,1200)==False` indicates that there is loss when the cost is more than the sell price. So, the function should return `False` in this case. 

The function `noprofit_noloss` should return `True` if the cost is less than or equal to the sell price, otherwise, it should return `False`. This is because there is no profit and no loss when the cost is less than or equal to the sell price. The function should return `False` when the cost is more than the sell price because there is loss in this case. The function should return `True` when the cost is equal to the sell price because there is neither profit nor loss in this case. The function should return `True` when the cost is less than the sell price because there is no profit in this case. 

So, the function `noprofit_noloss` should return `True` if the cost is less than or equal to the sell price, otherwise, it should return `False`. The unit test `assert noprofit_noloss(1500,1200)==False` indicates that there is loss when the cost is more than the sell price. So,
