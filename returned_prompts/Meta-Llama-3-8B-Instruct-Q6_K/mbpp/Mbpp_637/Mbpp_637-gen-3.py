```
def noprofit_noloss(amount, cost):
    return amount <= cost
```


This function takes two parameters: the amount and the cost. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the amount is less than or equal to the cost. In other words, it checks if there is no profit and no loss. If the amount is less than or equal to the cost, it means that there is no profit and no loss, so the function returns False. Otherwise, it returns True. This is in line with the unit test provided, which asserts that the function should return False when the amount is 1500 and the cost is 1200. 

The unit test is as follows:
```
assert noprofit_noloss(1500,1200)==False
```


This test checks if the function returns False when the amount is 1500 and the cost is 1200. Since 1500 is greater than 1200, the function should return False, which is the expected result. 

The function is a simple and straightforward implementation of the problem. It takes the amount and the cost as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether there is no profit and no loss. The function can be used in a variety of scenarios where it is necessary to check if there is no profit and no loss. For example, in finance, it can be used to determine if an investment has resulted in a loss or if there is no profit. In other fields, it can be used to determine if a transaction has resulted in a loss or if there is no profit. 

The function is also efficient and easy to understand. It is a simple and straightforward implementation of the problem, and it is easy to understand what the function does and how it works. This makes it easy to use and maintain. 

Overall, the function is a good solution to the problem. It is simple, efficient, and easy to understand. It can be used in a variety of scenarios where it is necessary to check if there is no profit and no loss. 

Note: The problem statement is not clear about the range of values for the amount and cost. However, based on the unit test provided, it seems that the amount and cost can be any positive integer. If the range of values for the amount and cost is different, the function may need to be modified accordingly. 

Also, the function does not handle the case where the amount or cost is less than or equal to 0. If the amount or cost can be less
