def Extract(lst):
    return [x[0] for x in lst]
``` 

Explanation: 
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list. For each sublist, it takes the first element (at index 0) and adds it to the result list. The function returns the result list.

The unit test `assert Extract([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]) == [1, 3, 6]` ensures that the function works correctly by checking if the output is as expected. 

For example, when the input is `[[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]`, the function will return `[1, 3, 6]`, which is the first element of each sublist.  The test passes because the output matches the expected result. 
```python
assert Extract([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]) == [1, 3, 6]
```  ```python
print(Extract([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]))  # Output: [1, 3, 6]
```  ```python
print(Extract([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]) == [1, 3, 6])  # Output: True
```  ```python
print(Extract([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]) == [1, 3, 6])  # Output: True
