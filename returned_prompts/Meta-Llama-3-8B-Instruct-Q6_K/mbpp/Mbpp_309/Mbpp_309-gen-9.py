```
def maximum(a, b):
    if a > b:
        return a
    else:
        return b
```
This function takes two numbers as input, compares them, and returns the larger one. The unit test `assert maximum(5,10) == 10` ensures that the function works correctly. 

Note: Python's built-in `max()` function can also be used to find the maximum of two numbers. However, the problem statement asks for a custom function to be written. 
```
def maximum(a, b):
    return max(a, b)
```  is a valid but not the best solution.  The problem is asking for a function that takes two numbers as input and returns the maximum, not the built-in max function.  The built-in max function can take more than two arguments.  It can also handle non-numeric inputs, which may not be the desired behavior in this case.  The provided solution is more specific and limited to the problem's requirements.  It only takes two arguments, and it only works with two numbers.  It does not handle non-numeric inputs.  It is a more precise and specific solution to the problem.  The unit test provided also suggests that the function should be more specific and limited to the problem's requirements.  It tests the function with two numbers, not with more than two numbers or with non-numeric inputs.  Therefore, the provided solution is a better solution to the problem.  It is a more precise and specific solution to the problem.  It only works with the problem's requirements, and it is more likely to pass the unit test.  It is a better solution to the problem.
