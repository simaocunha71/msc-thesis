```
def maximum(a, b):
    if a >= b:
        return a
    else:
        return b
```


This function takes two numbers as arguments and returns the maximum of the two. It does this by comparing the two numbers and returning the larger one. If the first number is greater than or equal to the second, it returns the first number. Otherwise, it returns the second number. The unit test provided, `assert maximum(5,10) == 10`, confirms that this function works correctly. 

Please note that the problem description doesn't specify whether the function should work for more than two numbers. This function only works for two numbers. If you need a function that works for more than two numbers, you would need to use a different approach, such as a loop or a built-in function like `max()`.
