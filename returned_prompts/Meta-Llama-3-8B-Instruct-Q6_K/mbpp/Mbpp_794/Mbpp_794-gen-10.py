"""
The task is to create a function that takes a string as input and returns True if the string starts with 'a' and ends with 'b', and False otherwise.

Here's a Python solution for this problem:

```python
def match_a_endb(text):
    return text.startswith('a') and text.endswith('b')
```

This function uses the built-in string methods `startswith` and `endswith` to check if the string starts with 'a' and ends with 'b', respectively. The `and` operator is used to combine these conditions. If both conditions are True, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

The provided unit test `assert text_starta_endb("aabbbb")` ensures that the function works correctly. It checks if the string "aabbbb" starts with 'a' and ends with 'b', which it does, so the function should return True. If the function is implemented correctly, this test will pass."""
