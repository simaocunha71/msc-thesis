The problem is asking to create a function that takes a string as an input and checks if it starts with 'a' and ends with 'b'. 

The unit test `assert text_starta_endb("aabbbb")` suggests that the function should return True for the input "aabbbb" and False for any other input.

Here's a Python solution for the problem:

```Python
def text_starta_endb(text):
    return text.startswith('a') and text.endswith('b')
```

In this solution, the `startswith` method is used to check if the string starts with 'a' and the `endswith` method is used to check if the string ends with 'b'. Both conditions need to be met for the function to return True. Otherwise, it returns False. 

The unit test `assert text_starta_endb("aabbbb")` passes because "aabbbb" starts with 'a' and ends with 'b', so the function returns True. For any other input, the function returns False.
