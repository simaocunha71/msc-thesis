```
def tuple_modulo(t1, t2):
    return tuple(x % y for x, y in zip(t1, t2))
```
The function `tuple_modulo` takes two tuples `t1` and `t2` and returns a new tuple where each element is the result of the modulo operation between the corresponding elements in `t1` and `t2`. The `zip` function is used to iterate over the two tuples in parallel. The `tuple` function is used to convert the result into a tuple. The unit test `assert tuple_modulo((10, 4, 5, 6), (5, 6, 7, 5)) == (0, 4, 5, 1)` shows that the function works as expected.  For example, the first element of the result is `10 % 5 = 0`, the second element is `4 % 6 = 4`, and so on.
