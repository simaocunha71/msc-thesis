```
def tuple_modulo(t1, t2):
    return tuple((a % b) for a, b in zip(t1, t2))
```


This function uses the built-in Python function `zip()` to iterate over the two tuples in parallel. For each pair of elements, it calculates the modulo of the elements and returns a new tuple with these results. 

For example, if we have two tuples `(10, 4, 5, 6)` and `(5, 6, 7, 5)`, the function will return `(0, 4, 5, 1)`, which is the result of the element-wise modulo operation. 

The unit test `assert tuple_modulo((10, 4, 5, 6), (5, 6, 7, 5)) == (0, 4, 5, 1)` confirms that this function works correctly.
