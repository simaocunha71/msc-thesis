```
def tuple_modulo(t1, t2):
    return tuple(i % j for i, j in zip(t1, t2))
```





The problem is asking you to create a function that takes two tuples of the same length and returns a new tuple where each element is the result of the modulo operation between the corresponding elements of the input tuples.

The unit test `assert tuple_modulo((10, 4, 5, 6), (5, 6, 7, 5)) == (0, 4, 5, 1)` helps to clarify the problem by showing that the function should return the tuple `(0, 4, 5, 1)` when given the tuples `(10, 4, 5, 6)` and `(5, 6, 7, 5)`.

Here is a Python solution for the problem:

```
def tuple_modulo(t1, t2):
    return tuple(i % j for i, j in zip(t1, t2))
```

This function uses the built-in `zip` function to iterate over the corresponding elements of the two input tuples, and the modulo operator `%` to calculate the result of the modulo operation. The results are then combined into a new tuple using the `tuple` function.
