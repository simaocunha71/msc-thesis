```
def tuple_modulo(t1, t2):
    return tuple(x % y for x, y in zip(t1, t2))
```



The unit test `assert tuple_modulo((10, 4, 5, 6), (5, 6, 7, 5)) == (0, 4, 5, 1)` helps to understand the problem. It means that the function should return a tuple where each element is the result of the modulo operation between the corresponding elements of the input tuples.

The solution uses the built-in functions `zip` and `tuple` to iterate over the elements of the input tuples, perform the modulo operation, and return the result as a tuple. The `zip` function pairs the elements of the input tuples, and the generator expression `x % y for x, y in zip(t1, t2)` calculates the modulo for each pair of elements. The `tuple` function is used to convert the generator expression into a tuple.

For example, if we call `tuple_modulo((10, 4, 5, 6), (5, 6, 7, 5))`, the function will return `(0, 4, 5, 1)`, which is the result of the modulo operation between the corresponding elements of the input tuples.
