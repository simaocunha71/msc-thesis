```
def tuple_modulo(t1, t2):
    return tuple(x % y for x, y in zip(t1, t2))
```





The task is to write a function that takes two tuples of the same length and returns a new tuple where each element is the result of the modulo operation between the corresponding elements of the input tuples.

For example, if we have the tuples `(10, 4, 5, 6)` and `(5, 6, 7, 5)`, the function should return `(0, 4, 5, 1)` because `10 % 5 == 0`, `4 % 6 == 4`, `5 % 7 == 5`, and `6 % 5 == 1`.

The provided unit test `assert tuple_modulo((10, 4, 5, 6), (5, 6, 7, 5)) == (0, 4, 5, 1)` helps to clarify the expected behavior of the function.

Here is a Python function that achieves this:

```
def tuple_modulo(t1, t2):
    return tuple(x % y for x, y in zip(t1, t2))
```

This function uses a generator expression to iterate over the corresponding elements of the input tuples, perform the modulo operation, and create a new tuple with the results. The `zip` function is used to iterate over the elements of the tuples in parallel.
