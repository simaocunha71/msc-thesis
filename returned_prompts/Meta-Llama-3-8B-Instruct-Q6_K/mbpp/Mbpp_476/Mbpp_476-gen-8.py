```
def big_sum(arr):
    return max(arr) + min(arr)
```
The problem is asking for a function that takes an array as input and returns the sum of the largest and smallest values in the array. 

In the given unit test, it's clear that the function should return the sum of the maximum and minimum values in the array. For example, if the array is [1,2,3], the function should return 1 + 3 = 4.

Here is a simple Python function that achieves this:

```
def big_sum(arr):
    return max(arr) + min(arr)
```

This function uses the built-in `max` and `min` functions in Python to find the largest and smallest values in the array, respectively. It then returns the sum of these two values. 

This function will work for any array, not just the one given in the unit test. For example, if the array is [10,20,30], the function will return 10 + 30 = 40.  If the array is [-10,-20,-30], the function will return -30 + -10 = -40.  And so on.  The function is flexible and will work for any array.  It does not matter how many elements the array has, or what the values are, the function will always return the sum of the largest and smallest values.  It is a very simple and effective solution to the problem.  It is also very easy to understand and test.  It is a great example of the power and simplicity of Python.
