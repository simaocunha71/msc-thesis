The nth Catalan number can be calculated using the formula: C(n) = (2n)! / ((n+1)! * n!), where n is a positive integer.

Here is the Python code to calculate the nth Catalan number:

```python
import math

def catalan_number(n):
    return math.factorial(2*n) // (math.factorial(n+1) * math.factorial(n))
```

This function uses the math.factorial function to calculate the factorial of a number. The // operator is used for integer division, which is used to avoid floating point division.

The unit test `assert catalan_number(10)==16796` is used to verify that the function is working correctly. The 10th Catalan number is indeed 16796. 

This function will work correctly for any positive integer n. For example, `catalan_number(5)` will return 42, which is the 5th Catalan number. 

Please note that the Catalan numbers are named after the mathematician Eug√®ne Charles Catalan, who first studied them in the 19th century. They have many applications in combinatorics, computer science, and other fields.
