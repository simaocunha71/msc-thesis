```
def replace_char(s, old, new):
    return s.replace(old, new)
```
In this function, we use the built-in replace method of the string class in Python. This method replaces all occurrences of the old character with the new character. For example, if we have the string "polygon" and we want to replace all occurrences of 'y' with 'l', the result will be "pollgon".
