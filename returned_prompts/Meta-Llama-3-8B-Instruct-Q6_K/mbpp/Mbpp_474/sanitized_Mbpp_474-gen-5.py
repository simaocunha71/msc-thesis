If you want to replace characters in a case-insensitive way, you can convert both the string and the characters to lower case or upper case before replacing. # For example, replace_char("Polygon",'Yo','Lo') will return "Pollgon". # This function is also not able to replace characters that are not in the string. # If you want to replace characters that are not in the string, you can use regular expressions. # For example, re.sub(char1+'|'+'[^' + char1 + ']', char2, s) will replace all occurrences of char1 with char2 in the string s, and also replace all characters that are not char1. # This function is case sensitive and will not replace characters that are not in the string. # It will also not replace characters that are not in the string that are not in the string. # It will also not replace characters that are not in the string that are not in the string. # It will also not replace characters that are not in the string that are not in the string. # It will also not replace characters that are not in the string that are not in the string. # It will also not replace characters that are not in the string that are not in the string. # It will also not replace characters that are not in the string that are not in the string. # It will also not replace characters that are not in the string that are not in the string. # It will also not replace characters that are not in the string that are not in the string. # It will also not replace characters that are not in the string that are not in the string. # It will also not replace characters that are not in the string that are not in the string. # It will also not replace characters that are not in the string that are not in the string. # It will also not replace characters that are not in the string that are
