Explanation:
This function checks for polite numbers. A polite number is a number that is not a sum of the proper divisors of any other number. The function starts from 1 and checks for each number whether it is polite or not. It continues this process until it finds the nth polite number. The polite_count variable is used to keep track of the count of polite numbers found so far. The function returns the nth polite number. The unit test case checks for the 7th polite number, which is 11. The function should return 11 for this test case. Similarly, it should return 9 for the 5th polite number.
