Explanation:
1. The function `is_polite(n)` checks if a given number is a polite number. 
   A polite number is a number that is not the sum of any two smaller positive integers.
2. The function `nth_polite_number(n)` finds the nth polite number.
3. The unit tests `assert is_polite(7) == 11` and `assert nth_polite_number(7) == 11` 
   ensure that the functions work correctly.
4. The code uses a while loop to generate numbers and checks if each number is polite.
5. The polite numbers are stored in a list and the nth polite number is returned.
6. If no polite numbers are found, the function returns `None`. 

Note: The function `is_polite(n)` is not used in the solution provided. It was left in the problem statement. The function `nth_polite_number(n)` is the actual solution. 
The `is_polite(n)` function is used in the problem statement to test the correctness of the solution. It is not used in the solution itself.
