Explanation: 
This function iterates over the array. If the current element is not equal to the next one, it means that this element appears only once, so it is returned. The loop stops when it finds the first element that appears only once or when it reaches the end of the array. The unit test `assert search([1,1,2,2,3]) == 3` ensures that the function works correctly. This problem is a variation of the "Single Number" problem, but in this case, the array is sorted, which makes the solution simpler. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the array, and the space complexity is O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of space. .


Note: This solution assumes that the array is sorted and that the element that appears only once is not the first or the last one. If these assumptions are not valid, the solution would need to be adjusted accordingly. .


Also, the solution does not handle the case where the array contains duplicate elements that are not adjacent. For example, the array [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4] would return 1, but the correct answer is 4. If the array can contain non-adjacent duplicates, the solution would need to be adjusted to handle this case. .


The unit test `assert search([1,1,2,2,3]) == 3` ensures that the function works correctly for the case where the array contains adjacent duplicates. However, it does not cover the case where the array contains non-adjacent duplicates. To handle this case, the solution would need to be adjusted to keep track of the count of each element in the array, and then return the element with a count of 1. This would require a hash table or a dictionary to keep track of the counts, which would increase the time complexity to O(n) and the space complexity to O(n). .


Here is the adjusted solution that handles the case where the array contains non-adjacent duplicates:
```
def search(nums):
    count = {}
    for num in nums:
        if num in count:
            count[num] += 1
        else:
            count[num] = 1
    for num
