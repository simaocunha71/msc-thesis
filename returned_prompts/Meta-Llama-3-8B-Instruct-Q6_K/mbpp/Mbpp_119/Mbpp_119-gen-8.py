```
def search(nums):
    for i in range(len(nums)-1):
        if nums[i] != nums[i+1]:
            return nums[i]
    return nums[-1]
``` 
The problem asks you to write a function that finds the element that appears only once in a sorted array. 

The given unit test `assert search([1,1,2,2,3]) == 3` suggests that the array is sorted in ascending order and the element that appears only once is the last element that is not equal to the next element. 

In this case, the function iterates over the array and returns the element that is not equal to the next element. If no such element is found, it returns the last element of the array.

The function has a time complexity of O(n) because it needs to iterate over the entire array. It has a space complexity of O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space. 

This function assumes that the input array is sorted in ascending order and that there is at least one element that appears only once. If these assumptions are not valid, the function may not work correctly. 

For example, if the array is not sorted, the function may return an incorrect result. If there are no elements that appear only once, the function may return the last element of the array, which may not be the correct result. 

In a real-world scenario, you would need to add error checking code to handle these cases. For example, you could check if the array is sorted before calling the function, and you could check if the function returns a result before returning it. 

Here is an updated version of the function that includes error checking code:
```
def search(nums):
    if len(nums) == 0:
        return None
    if len(set(nums)) != len(nums):
        return None
    for i in range(len(nums)-1):
        if nums[i] != nums[i+1]:
            return nums[i]
    return nums[-1]
``` 
This function returns None if the array is empty or if there are duplicate elements in the array. It returns the last element of the array if there are no elements that appear only once. Otherwise, it returns the element that appears only once. 

This function is more robust than the original function because it includes error checking code to handle invalid input. However, it still assumes that the input array is sorted in ascending order, and it may not work correctly if this assumption is not valid.
