```
def larg_nnum(lst, n):
    return sorted(lst, reverse=True)[:n]
```
This function sorts the list in descending order and then returns the first n items. The unit test provided ensures that the function returns the n largest items from the list. It checks that the function returns [100, 90] when given the list [10, 20, 50, 70, 90, 20, 50, 40, 60, 80, 100] and n=2. 

The function is robust and can handle lists of any size and any type of elements. It does not assume that the list contains only numbers, and it works correctly even if the list contains duplicate items. 

The time complexity of this function is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the sorted list. 

The function can be optimized by using the heapq module's nlargest function, which has a time complexity of O(n log k), where k is the number of largest items to return. Here is the optimized function:

```
import heapq
def larg_nnum(lst, n):
    return heapq.nlargest(n, lst)
```

This function has the same functionality as the original function but is more efficient for large lists. 

The unit test remains the same for both functions:

```
assert set(larg_nnum([10, 20, 50, 70, 90, 20, 50, 40, 60, 80, 100],2))==set([100,90])
