```
def diff_even_odd(lst):
    even_nums = [num for num in lst if num % 2 == 0]
    odd_nums = [num for num in lst if num % 2 != 0]
    return abs(even_nums[0] - odd_nums[0])
```  # Output: 3

Explanation:
The function `diff_even_odd` takes a list as input and returns the absolute difference of the first even and first odd number in the list. 
It uses list comprehension to create lists of even and odd numbers. 
Then it returns the absolute difference of the first elements of these two lists. 
The unit test `assert diff_even_odd([1,3,5,7,4,1,6,8])==3` ensures that the function works correctly.
