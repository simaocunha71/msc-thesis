def diff_even_odd(lst):
    even = next((x for x in lst if isinstance(x, int) and x % 2 == 0), None)
    odd = next((x for x in lst if isinstance(x, int) and x % 2 != 0), None)
    return even - odd
```
The function `diff_even_odd` takes a list of numbers as input. It uses list comprehension to find the first even and first odd number in the list. If no even or odd number is found, it returns `None`. Then it returns the difference of the first even and first odd number. If no even or odd number is found, it returns `None`. 

For example, if the input list is `[1,3,5,7,4,1,6,8]`, the function will return `3` because `4` is the first even number and `1` is the first odd number, and `4-1=3`. 

The unit test `assert diff_even_odd([1,3,5,7,4,1,6,8])==3` ensures that the function returns the correct result. 

This function assumes that the list contains at least one even and one odd number. If the list does not contain at least one even and one odd number, the function will return `None`. If you want to handle this case differently, you can modify the function accordingly. 

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the list, because it iterates over the list once. The space complexity is O(1), because it uses a constant amount of space.
