You can use the `max` function with a custom key to find the maximum aggregate from the list of tuples. The custom key function should return the sum of the second element of each tuple.

Here is the Python code that solves the problem:

```Python
def max_aggregate(tuples):
    return max(tuples, key=lambda x: x[1])
```

This function takes a list of tuples as input, where each tuple contains a name and a score. The `max` function is used with a custom key to find the maximum score. The custom key is a lambda function that returns the second element of each tuple (i.e., the score). The `max` function returns the tuple with the maximum score.

For example, if you call `max_aggregate([('Juan Whelan',90),('Sabah Colley',88),('Peter Nichols',7),('Juan Whelan',122),('Sabah Colley',84)])`, the function will return `('Juan Whelan', 212)`, which is the tuple with the maximum aggregate score. The aggregate score is the sum of all scores for each name.

The unit test `assert max_aggregate([('Juan Whelan',90),('Sabah Colley',88),('Peter Nichols',7),('Juan Whelan',122),('Sabah Colley',84)])==('Juan Whelan', 212)` ensures that the function works correctly. It checks that the function returns the tuple with the maximum aggregate score. If the function works correctly, the unit test will pass. If the function does not work correctly, the unit test will fail.
