```
def pair_xor_Sum(lst, k):
    result = 0
    for i in range(len(lst)):

            result += lst[i] ^ lst[j]
    return result ^ k
```
This function takes a list of numbers and an integer k as input. It calculates the sum of the XOR of all pairs of numbers in the list and then XORs the result with k. The unit test `assert pair_xor_Sum([5,9,7,6],4) == 47` shows that the function should return 47 for the input list `[5,9,7,6]` and `k=4`. 

The time complexity of this function is O(n^2) because it has two nested loops that iterate over the list. The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the result.
