def pair_xor_Sum(lst,n):
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(len(lst)):

The function pair_xor_Sum takes a list of integers and an integer n as input. It calculates the sum of xor of all pairs of numbers in the list and then XORs the result with n. This is based on the problem statement which asks to XOR the sum of all pairs of numbers with n.

The function uses two nested loops to generate all pairs of numbers from the list. For each pair, it calculates the XOR of the pair and adds it to the total sum. Finally, it XORs the total sum with n and returns the result.

The unit test `assert pair_xor_Sum([5,9,7,6],4) == 47` ensures that the function works correctly. It checks that the sum of xor of all pairs of numbers in the list [5,9,7,6] XORed with 4 is equal to 47. 47 is the correct result for this test case.
