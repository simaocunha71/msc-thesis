```
def remove_lowercase(s):
    return ''.join(c for c in s if not c.islower())
```


Explanation:
The task is to create a function that takes a string as input and returns the same string but with all lowercase characters removed. 

The unit test `assert remove_lowercase("PYTHon")==('PYTH')` suggests that the function should remove all lowercase characters from the string, leaving only the uppercase characters and the original string order.

The function `remove_lowercase` uses a generator expression to iterate over each character in the input string. It checks if the character is not lowercase using the `islower` method, and if it is not, it includes it in the resulting string. The `join` method is then used to concatenate the characters into a single string. 

This function works by iterating over each character in the string, checking if it is lowercase, and if not, including it in the resulting string. The `islower` method checks if a character is lowercase, and the `join` method is used to concatenate the characters into a single string. 

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because it iterates over each character in the string once. The space complexity is also O(n), because it creates a new string to store the result.
