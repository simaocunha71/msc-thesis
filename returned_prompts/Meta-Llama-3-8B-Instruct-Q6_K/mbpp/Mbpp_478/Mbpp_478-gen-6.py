def remove_lowercase(s):
    return ''.join(c for c in s if not c.islower())  # or return ''.join([c for c in s if not c.islower()]) for python 2.x

This function uses a generator expression to iterate over each character in the string. It uses the islower() method to check if the character is lowercase. If it's not, it includes it in the resulting string. The result is a new string with all lowercase characters removed. 

The unit test you provided suggests that you want to keep uppercase letters and digits, and remove all lowercase letters. The function above does exactly that. It will remove all lowercase letters, leaving the remaining characters (uppercase letters and digits) in the string. 

For example, if you call remove_lowercase("PYTHon"), it will return 'PYTH', which is the string with all lowercase letters removed. 
Note that the function is case sensitive, so it will treat uppercase and lowercase letters as different characters. If you want to treat them as the same character, you would need to convert the string to either all uppercase or all lowercase before processing it.
