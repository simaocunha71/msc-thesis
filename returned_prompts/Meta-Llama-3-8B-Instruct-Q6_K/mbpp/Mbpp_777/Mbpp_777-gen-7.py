The function `find_sum` takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of the non-repeated elements in the list. 

It uses a dictionary to count the frequency of each number in the list. Then it iterates over the dictionary and adds the numbers with a count of 1 to the sum.

The unit test `assert find_sum([1,2,3,1,1,4,5,6]) == 21` ensures that the function works correctly. The sum of the non-repeated elements in the list [1,2,3,1,1,4,5,6] is indeed 21. 

For example, the number 2 is not repeated, the number 3 is not repeated, the number 4 is not repeated, the number 5 is not repeated, the number 6 is not repeated. So, the sum of the non-repeated elements is 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21.  The numbers 1 is repeated, so it is not included in the sum.  The function correctly identifies the non-repeated elements and returns their sum.
