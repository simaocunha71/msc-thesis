The function `find_sum` takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of all non-repeated elements in the list. It works by first counting the occurrences of each number in the list using a dictionary. Then it iterates over the dictionary and adds up the numbers that appear only once (i.e., the non-repeated elements). 

The unit test `assert find_sum([1,2,3,1,1,4,5,6]) == 21` ensures that the function works correctly by comparing the result of the function with the expected output. In this case, the function should return 21, which is the sum of the non-repeated elements 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. 

The function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list, because it needs to iterate over the list twice (once to count the occurrences of each number and once to add up the non-repeated elements). The space complexity is also O(n), because in the worst case (when all elements are different), the dictionary will store n elements.
