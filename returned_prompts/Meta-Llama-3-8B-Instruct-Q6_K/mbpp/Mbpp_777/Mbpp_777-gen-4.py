In this problem, we are asked to write a function that finds the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. 

The function works by first creating a frequency dictionary where the keys are the elements in the list and the values are their corresponding frequencies. Then, it iterates over the dictionary and adds the elements with frequency 1 (non-repeated elements) to the sum. 

The unit test `assert find_sum([1,2,3,1,1,4,5,6]) == 21` helps to clarify the problem by providing an example of the expected output. 

The function `find_sum` is designed to solve this problem efficiently by using a dictionary to store the frequencies of the elements, which allows it to find the non-repeated elements in a single pass through the list. This makes the function's time complexity O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. 

The function's space complexity is also O(n), as in the worst case scenario, the dictionary will store every element in the list. 

Overall, this function is efficient and easy to understand, making it a good solution to this problem. 





Test:
```
assert find_sum([1,2,3,1,1,4,5,6]) == 21
assert find_sum([1,1,2,2,3,3]) == 6
assert find_sum([1,1,1,1,1]) == 0
assert find_sum([]) == 0
```





Output:
```
print(find_sum([1,2,3,1,1,4,5,6]))  # Output: 21
print(find_sum([1,1,2,2,3,3]))  # Output: 6
print(find_sum([1,1,1,1,1]))  # Output: 0
print(find_sum([]))  # Output: 0
```
