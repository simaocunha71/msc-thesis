```
def split_two_parts(lst, L):
    return (lst[:L], lst[L:])
```


The problem is asking to create a function that takes a list and an integer L as input, and returns a tuple containing two lists. The first list should have L elements, and the second list should have the remaining elements from the original list.

The unit test provided helps to clarify the problem by showing the expected output for a given input. It suggests that the function should split the list into two parts at the given length L, and return the two lists in a tuple.

Here's a Python solution that uses list slicing to achieve this:

```
def split_two_parts(lst, L):
    return (lst[:L], lst[L:])
```

This function uses the slice notation `lst[:L]` to get the first L elements of the list, and `lst[L:]` to get the remaining elements. The two lists are then returned as a tuple. The unit test provided confirms that this function behaves as expected.
