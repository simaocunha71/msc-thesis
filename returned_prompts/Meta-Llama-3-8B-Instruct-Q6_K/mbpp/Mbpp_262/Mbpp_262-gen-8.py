```
def split_two_parts(lst, L):
    return lst[:L], lst[L:]
```


The problem is asking you to write a function that takes a list and an integer L as input, and returns a tuple containing two lists. The first list in the tuple should contain the first L elements of the input list, and the second list should contain the remaining elements of the input list.

The unit test provided helps to clarify the problem. It shows that if the input list is [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,1] and L is 3, the function should return ([1, 1, 2], [3, 4, 4, 5, 1]).

To solve this problem, you can use Python's list slicing feature. The expression lst[:L] returns a list containing the first L elements of the input list, and the expression lst[L:] returns a list containing the remaining elements of the input list. You can use these expressions in a tuple to return the desired result.

Here is the solution:
```
def split_two_parts(lst, L):
    return lst[:L], lst[L:]
```
This function takes a list `lst` and an integer `L` as input, and returns a tuple containing two lists. The first list is the first `L` elements of the input list, and the second list is the remaining elements of the input list. The unit test provided helps to clarify the problem, and the solution uses Python's list slicing feature to achieve the desired result.
