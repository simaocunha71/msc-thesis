def replace_list(list1, list2):
    list1[-1:] = list2
    return list1
```


This function replaces the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list. The unit test `assert replace_list([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10],[2, 4, 6, 8])==[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8]` passes with this function. The function uses Python's slice assignment feature to replace the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list. The slice `list1[-1:]` refers to the last element of the list, and the `=` operator is used to assign the elements of the second list to this slice. The function then returns the modified list.
