```
def replace_list(list1, list2):
    list1[-1:] = list2
    return list1
```



The problem is asking to write a function that takes two lists as input and replaces the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list.

The unit test provided suggests that the function should replace the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list in the order they appear in the second list. For example, if the input lists are [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10] and [2, 4, 6, 8], the function should return [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8].

Here is a Python solution for the problem:

```
def replace_list(list1, list2):
    list1[-1:] = list2
    return list1
```

This function uses Python's slice notation to replace the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list. The `[-1:]` slice means "from the end of the list to the end", so replacing it with the elements of the second list effectively replaces the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list. The function then returns the modified first list.
