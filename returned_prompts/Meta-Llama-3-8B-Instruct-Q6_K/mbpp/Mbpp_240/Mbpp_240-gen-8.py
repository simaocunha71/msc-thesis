```
def replace_list(list1, list2):
    list1[-1:] = list2
    return list1
```



The function replace_list takes two lists as input and replaces the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list. The unit test `assert replace_list([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10],[2, 4, 6, 8])==[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8]` ensures that the function works correctly. The function uses list slicing (`list1[-1:]`) to get the last element of the first list, and then assigns the elements of the second list to it. The function returns the modified first list. 



Here is the Python code:

```Python
def replace_list(list1, list2):
    list1[-1:] = list2
    return list1
```



The function replace_list takes two lists as input and replaces the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list. The unit test `assert replace_list([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10],[2, 4, 6, 8])==[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8]` ensures that the function works correctly. The function uses list slicing (`list1[-1:]`) to get the last element of the first list, and then assigns the elements of the second list to it. The function returns the modified first list. 

The function does not check if the input lists are empty, and it does not check if the second list is longer than the first list. It simply replaces the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list. 

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the second list. This is because the function iterates over the elements of the second list once. The space complexity is O(1), which means the space required does not change with the size of the input lists, because the function only uses a constant amount of space. 

The function can be used to replace the last element of a list with the elements of another list. It can be used in a variety of situations, such as when processing data and needing to replace a value with a new set of values.
