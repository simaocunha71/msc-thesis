```
def replace_list(lst1, lst2):
    lst1[-1] = lst2
    return lst1 + lst2[1:]
```



The problem asks you to create a function that takes two lists as input and replaces the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list. 

The given unit test suggests that the function should replace the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list and then return the modified list.

Here is the Python solution for the problem:

```
def replace_list(lst1, lst2):
    lst1[-1] = lst2
    return lst1 + lst2[1:]
```

This function works by replacing the last element of the first list (`lst1[-1]`) with the elements of the second list (`lst2`). Then, it returns the modified list (`lst1 + lst2[1:]`), which includes all elements of `lst1` and all elements of `lst2` except the first one. 

Note that this function modifies the original list `lst1`. If you want to keep the original list unchanged, you can create a copy of `lst1` at the beginning of the function. Here is how you can do it:

```
def replace_list(lst1, lst2):
    lst1_copy = lst1.copy()
    lst1_copy[-1] = lst2
    return lst1_copy + lst2[1:]
```



This version of the function creates a copy of `lst1` using the `copy()` method, modifies the copy, and then returns the modified copy. This way, the original list `lst1` remains unchanged.
