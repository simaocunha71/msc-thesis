#Explanation:
The problem asks you to create a function that takes two lists as input. It should replace the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list.

The unit test `assert replace_list([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10],[2, 4, 6, 8])==[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8]` suggests that the function should replace the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list.

The solution is to use list slicing and assignment. The `list1[-1:]` expression gets the last element of the first list, and `list2` is the list of elements to replace it with. The `list1[-1:] = list2` statement replaces the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list.

The function `replace_list` takes two lists as input, replaces the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list, and returns the modified list.

The unit test `assert replace_list([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10],[2, 4, 6, 8])==[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8]` passes, indicating that the function works correctly.
