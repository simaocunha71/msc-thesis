The problem is asking to write a function that checks if a given number is a Woodall number or not. A Woodall number is a positive integer of the form n^2 * 2^n + 1, where n is a positive integer.

The unit test `assert is_woodall(383) == True` suggests that the number 383 is a Woodall number. Therefore, we can write the function as follows:

```python
def is_woodall(n):
    i = 1
    while True:
        if (i**2) * 2**i + 1 == n:
            return True
        elif (i**2) * 2**i + 1 > n:
            return False
        i += 1
```

This function works by iterating over all possible values of `i` and checking if the number generated by the formula `i^2 * 2^i + 1` is equal to the given number `n`. If it finds a match, it returns `True`. If it reaches a point where the generated number is greater than `n`, it returns `False`. The function will continue to iterate until it finds a match or determines that the number is not a Woodall number.
