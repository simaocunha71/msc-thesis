The problem is asking to create a function that determines if a given number is a Woodall number or not. A Woodall number is a positive integer of the form 2^(p-1) * 2^p - 1, where p is also a positive integer.

Looking at the unit test provided, `assert is_woodall(383) == True`, we can assume that the input number is the Woodall number itself. Therefore, we need to check if the given number can be expressed in the form mentioned above.

Here is the Python function to solve this problem:

```python
def is_woodall(n):
    i = 1
    while True:
        if 2**(i-1)*2**i - 1 == n:
            return True
        elif 2**(i-1)*2**i - 1 > n:
            return False
        i += 1
```

This function works by iterating through possible values of `p` and checking if the corresponding Woodall number equals the given number. If it finds a match, it returns `True`. If it reaches a point where the generated Woodall number is greater than the given number, it returns `False` as the number is not a Woodall number. If the loop runs indefinitely, it means the number is not a Woodall number.
