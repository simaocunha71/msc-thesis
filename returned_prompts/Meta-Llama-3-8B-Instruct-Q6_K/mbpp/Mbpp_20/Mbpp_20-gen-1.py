The `is_woodall` function checks if a given number is a Woodall number. A Woodall number is a prime number of the form 2^p - 1, where p is also a prime number. The function checks if the number is less than or equal to 1, in which case it is not a Woodall number. Then it checks if the number has any divisors other than 1 and itself, in which case it is not a Woodall number. If the number passes these checks, it is a Woodall number and the function returns True. The unit test `assert is_woodall(383) == True` indicates that the function should return True for the number 383, which is a Woodall number.
