The problem is asking to write a function that checks if a given number is a Woodall number or not. A Woodall number is a number of the form 2^n*(2^n-1) for some positive integer n.

The unit test `assert is_woodall(383) == True` suggests that 383 is a Woodall number.

Here is the Python solution:
```
def is_woodall(n):
    i = 1
    while 2**i*(2**i-1) < n:
        i += 1
    return 2**i*(2**i-1) == n
```


This function starts from 1 and keeps incrementing until it finds a value of `i` such that `2**i*(2**i-1)` is equal to `n`. If it finds such a value, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a Woodall number. If it doesn't find such a value, it returns `False`. This is because if `n` is not a Woodall number, the loop will run until `2**i*(2**i-1)` becomes greater than `n`. Since `i` is incremented in each iteration, this means that `2**i*(2**i-1)` will never equal `n`. Therefore, the function will return `False` in this case.
