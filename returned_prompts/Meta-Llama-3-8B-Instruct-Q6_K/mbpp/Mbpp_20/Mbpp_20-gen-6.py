"""
The function checks if a given number is a Woodall number or not. A Woodall number is a number that is one more or three more than a multiple of four. This function uses the `all` function and a generator expression to check if the number is a Woodall number. The number `n` is divided by 4, the result is floored, and then checked if the number is in the range of `4 * i + 1` to `4 * i + 3`. If all these conditions are met for `i` ranging from 0 to `(n - 1) // 4`, then the number is a Woodall number. The unit test `assert is_woodall(383) == True` ensures that the function works correctly.
