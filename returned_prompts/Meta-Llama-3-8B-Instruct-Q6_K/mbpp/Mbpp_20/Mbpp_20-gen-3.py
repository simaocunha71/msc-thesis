The problem is asking to write a function that checks if a given number is a Woodall number or not. A Woodall number is a positive integer that can be written in the form 2^n * 3^(n-1) + 1 for some positive integer n.

The unit test provided, `assert is_woodall(383) == True`, suggests that 383 is a Woodall number. We can use this information to write the function.

Here is the solution:
```
def is_woodall(n):
    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if 2**i * 3**(i-1) + 1 == n:
            return True
    return False
```
This function iterates over all possible values of i and checks if the number can be written in the form 2^n * 3^(n-1) + 1. If it finds such a value of i, it returns True. If it doesn't find any such value, it returns False. The function uses the square root of the number as the upper bound for the loop, which is an optimization to reduce the number of iterations.
