The problem is asking you to write a function that determines if a given number is a Woodall number or not. A Woodall number is a prime number of the form 2^p \* 2^(p-1) + 1, where p is also a prime number.

The unit test provided, `assert is_woodall(383) == True`, suggests that the function should return `True` for the number 383, which is indeed a Woodall number.

Here is the Python solution for the problem:
```python
def is_woodall(n):
    def is_prime(k):
        if k < 2:
            return False
        for i in range(2, int(k**0.5) + 1):
            if k % i == 0:
                return False
        return True

    for p in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if is_prime(p) and n == 2**p * 2**(p-1) + 1:
            return True
    return False
```
This function first defines a helper function `is_prime` to check if a number is prime. Then, it iterates over all possible prime numbers `p` less than or equal to the square root of `n`, and checks if `n` is a Woodall number with respect to `p`. If it finds such a `p`, it returns `True`. If it doesn't find any such `p`, it returns `False`.
