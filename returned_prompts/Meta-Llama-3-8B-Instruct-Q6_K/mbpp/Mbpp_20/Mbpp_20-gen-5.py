The problem is asking you to write a function that takes an integer as input and returns True if the number is a Woodall number, and False otherwise.

A Woodall number is a number of the form n*(2^n) + 1, where n is an integer.

Here's the Python function that solves the problem:

```python
def is_woodall(n):
    i = 1
    while True:
        woodall = i * (2**i) + 1
        if woodall == n:
            return True
        if woodall > n:
            return False
        i += 1
```

This function works by iterating over all possible values of n, and checking if the number is equal to the Woodall number for the current value of n. If it finds a match, it returns True. If it reaches a point where the Woodall number is greater than the input number, it returns False, indicating that the input number is not a Woodall number.

The unit test `assert is_woodall(383) == True` ensures that the function is working correctly. It checks if the function returns True when given the input 383, which is indeed a Woodall number. If the function is implemented correctly, this test should pass.
