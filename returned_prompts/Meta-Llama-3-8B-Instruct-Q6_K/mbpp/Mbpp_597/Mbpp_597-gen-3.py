def find_kth(arr1, arr2, k):
    i, j = 0, 0
    while i < len(arr1) and j < len(arr2):
        if k == 1:
            return min(arr1[i], arr2[j])
        k -= 1
        if arr1[i] < arr2[j]:
            i += 1
        else:

The function `find_kth` takes two sorted arrays `arr1` and `arr2` and an integer `k` as input, and returns the kth element from the combined sorted array. It uses a two-pointer approach to iterate through the arrays, keeping track of the current position in each array. The function returns the kth element by checking if `k` is 1, in which case it returns the smaller of the two current elements. Otherwise, it decrements `k` and moves the pointer to the array with the smaller current element. If one array is exhausted, the function returns the kth element from the remaining array. The unit test `assert find_kth([2, 3, 6, 7, 9], [1, 4, 8, 10], 5) == 6` verifies that the function correctly finds the 5th element from the combined sorted array.
