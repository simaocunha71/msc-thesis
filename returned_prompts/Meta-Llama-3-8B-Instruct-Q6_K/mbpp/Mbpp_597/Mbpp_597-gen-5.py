```
def find_kth(arr1, arr2, k):
    i, j = 0, 0
    while k > 0:
        if i == len(arr1):
            return arr2[j + k - 1]
        if j == len(arr2):
            return arr1[i + k - 1]
        if k == 1:
            return min(arr1[i], arr2[j])
        k -= 1
        if arr1[i] < arr2[j]:
            i += 1
        else:
            j += 1
    return None
```
The function `find_kth` takes two sorted arrays and an integer `k` as input and returns the `kth` element from the combined array. It uses two pointers `i` and `j` to traverse the arrays. If `k` is 1, it returns the minimum of the current elements in both arrays. Otherwise, it decrements `k` and moves the pointer to the smaller element. The process is repeated until `k` becomes 1. If `k` is greater than the length of one of the arrays, it returns the corresponding element. If `k` is less than or equal to 0, it returns `None`. The unit test `assert find_kth([2, 3, 6, 7, 9], [1, 4, 8, 10], 5) == 6` ensures the correctness of the function. 







I hope it is correct. Let me know if you have any further questions.
