The problem is asking for a Python function that counts the number of set bits (binary digits with value 1) in a given number. 

The unit test `assert count_Set_Bits(2) == 1` suggests that the function should return the number of set bits in the binary representation of the given number.

Here is the Python solution:
```
def count_Set_Bits(n):
    count = 0
    while n:
        count += n & 1
        n >>= 1
    return count
``` 

This function uses bitwise operations to count the set bits. The expression `n & 1` checks the least significant bit of `n` and adds it to the count if it is 1. The expression `n >>= 1` shifts the bits of `n` to the right by one position, effectively dividing `n` by 2. The function continues until `n` becomes 0, at which point all set bits have been counted. 

For example, if the input is `2`, the function will count the set bits as follows: `2` becomes `1` (right shift), and the count becomes `1`. Therefore, the function returns `1`, which is the correct number of set bits in the binary representation of `2`. 

Note that the function works for any non-negative integer input. If the input is negative, the function may not work correctly because the bitwise operations are not defined for negative numbers. If you need to handle negative inputs, you can add a check at the beginning of the function to make the input non-negative. For example:
```
def count_Set_Bits(n):
    if n < 0:
        n = -n
    count = 0
    while n:
        count += n & 1
        n >>= 1
    return count
```
