```
def union_elements(t1, t2):
    set1 = set(t1)
    set2 = set(t2)
    return tuple(sorted(set1.union(set2)))
```


The function union_elements takes two tuples as input, converts them into sets, finds the union of these sets, and then returns the result as a sorted tuple. The assert statement checks if the output of the function is as expected. The function works by converting the input tuples into sets, which are unordered collections of unique elements. The union of two sets is a set that contains all elements that are in either set. The sorted function is used to convert the set back into a sorted tuple. This way, the function ensures that the output is a sorted tuple of unique elements.
