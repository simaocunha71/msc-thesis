```
def union_elements(t1, t2):
    return tuple(sorted(set(t1 + t2)))
```
This function works by concatenating the two tuples, removing duplicates using the set function, sorting the result, and then converting it back to a tuple. The unit test provided ensures that the function works correctly. 

Here's how the function works:
- `t1 + t2` concatenates the two tuples into a single tuple.
- `set(t1 + t2)` removes duplicates by converting the tuple into a set, which is an unordered collection of unique elements.
- `sorted(set(t1 + t2))` sorts the set of unique elements in ascending order.
- `tuple(sorted(set(t1 + t2)))` converts the sorted list back into a tuple.

The result is a tuple containing the union of the elements from the two input tuples, in sorted order. 

The unit test provided ensures that the function works correctly:
- `assert union_elements((3, 4, 5, 6),(5, 7, 4, 10) ) == (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10)`
This test checks that the function correctly finds the union of the elements from the two input tuples and returns the result in sorted order. If the function is working correctly, this test should pass.  If the function is not working correctly, this test will fail, indicating that there is a bug in the function.  By writing unit tests, we can ensure that our code is working correctly and catch any bugs that may have been introduced during development.  This makes it easier to debug and maintain our code.  It also allows us to confidently use our code in a wide range of situations, knowing that it will work correctly and produce the expected results.  This is an important part of software development and is a key aspect of writing robust and reliable code.
