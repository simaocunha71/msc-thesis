```
def replace_spaces(s):
    return s.replace(' ', '_').replace('_', ' ')
```



The problem is asking to create a function that takes a string as input, replaces all spaces with underscores, and then replaces all underscores with spaces. The function should return the modified string.

The unit test `assert replace_spaces('Jumanji The Jungle') == 'Jumanji_The_Jungle'` helps to clarify the problem. It shows that the function should first replace all spaces with underscores, resulting in 'Jumanji_The_Jungle', and then replace all underscores with spaces, resulting in the original string.

Here is a Python solution for the problem:

```
def replace_spaces(s):
    return s.replace(' ', '_').replace('_', ' ')
```

This function uses the `replace` method of the string, which replaces all occurrences of the specified substring with the replacement string. The first `replace` method replaces all spaces with underscores, and the second `replace` method replaces all underscores with spaces. The resulting string is then returned.
