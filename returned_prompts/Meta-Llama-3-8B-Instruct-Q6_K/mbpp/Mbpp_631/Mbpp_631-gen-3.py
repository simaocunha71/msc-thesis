```
def replace_spaces(s):
    return s.replace(' ', '_').replace('_', ' ')
```


The unit test `assert replace_spaces('Jumanji The Jungle') == 'Jumanji_The_Jungle'` helps to understand that we need to replace all spaces with underscores and vice versa. The function `replace_spaces` should replace all spaces in the string with underscores and then replace all underscores with spaces.

The function `replace_spaces` uses the `replace` method of the string which replaces all occurrences of the first argument with the second argument. In this case, we replace all spaces with underscores and then all underscores with spaces. This achieves the desired output.
