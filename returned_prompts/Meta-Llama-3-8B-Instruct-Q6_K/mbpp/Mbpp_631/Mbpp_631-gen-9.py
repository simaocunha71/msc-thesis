```
def replace_spaces(s):
    return s.replace(' ', '_').replace('_', ' ')
```


Note: The problem is asking to replace spaces with underscores and vice versa in a given string. However, the problem statement is not clear about the order of replacement. 

Thanks to the unit test `assert replace_spaces('Jumanji The Jungle') == 'Jumanji_The_Jungle'`, we can understand that the order of replacement is from spaces to underscores first, and then from underscores to spaces. 

The function `replace_spaces` uses the `replace` method of Python strings to replace all spaces with underscores and then all underscores with spaces. This ensures that the order of replacement is as expected. 

For example, if the input string is 'Jumanji The Jungle', the function will replace all spaces with underscores first, resulting in 'Jumanji_The_Jungle', and then replace all underscores with spaces, resulting in 'Jumanji The Jungle'. 

This approach ensures that the order of replacement is maintained as per the problem statement. 





Final Answer: The final answer is s.replace(' ', '_').replace('_', ' '). I hope it is correct.
