```
def replace_spaces(s):
    return s.replace(' ', '_').replace('_', ' ')
```





This problem is asking to write a function that takes a string as input and replaces all the whitespaces with an underscore and vice versa. For example, if the input string is "Jumanji The Jungle", the output should be "Jumanji_The_Jungle".

The unit test provided helps to clarify the problem. It shows that the function should replace all spaces with underscores, and then replace all underscores with spaces. This can be achieved by using the replace() method twice, once to replace spaces with underscores and once to replace underscores with spaces.

Here's the solution:
```
def replace_spaces(s):
    return s.replace(' ', '_').replace('_', ' ')
```
This function takes a string `s` as input, replaces all spaces with underscores using the replace() method, and then replaces all underscores with spaces. The resulting string is then returned.
