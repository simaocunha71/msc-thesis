```
def word_len(word):
    return len(word) % 2 != 0
```


The function takes a string (word) as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the length of the word is odd or not. 

The unit test `assert word_len("Hadoop") == False` implies that the function should return False for the word "Hadoop" (which has an even length) and True for words with odd lengths. 

The function uses the modulus operator `%` to get the remainder of the division of the length of the word by 2. If the remainder is not 0, it means the length is odd, and the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False. 

This function passes the given unit test. 

Please note that the function does not check if the input is a string. If you want to add this check, you can modify the function as follows:

```
def word_len(word):
    if not isinstance(word, str):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a string")
    return len(word) % 2 != 0
```


This modified function will raise a TypeError if the input is not a string.
