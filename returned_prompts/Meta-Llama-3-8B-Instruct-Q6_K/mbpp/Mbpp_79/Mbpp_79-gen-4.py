```
def word_len(word):
    return len(word) % 2 != 0
``` 
This function uses the modulus operator `%` to find the remainder of the word length when divided by 2. If the remainder is not 0, then the length of the word is odd. 

The unit test `assert word_len("Hadoop") == False` suggests that the function should return `False` when the word length is even. Therefore, we return `False` when the remainder is 0, and `True` when the remainder is not 0. 

This function can be used as follows:
```
print(word_len("Hadoop"))  # Output: False
print(word_len("Hello"))  # Output: True
``` 
This function works by directly returning the result of the expression `len(word) % 2 != 0`. The `len(word)` expression calculates the length of the word, the `%` operator calculates the remainder of the division of the length by 2, and the `!= 0` expression checks if the remainder is not 0. If the remainder is not 0, the function returns `True`, indicating that the length of the word is odd. If the remainder is 0, the function returns `False`, indicating that the length of the word is even. 

This function is simple and efficient, and it works correctly for words of any length. 

Note that this function does not modify the word, it only checks its length. It also does not handle non-string inputs, it will raise an error if a non-string is passed to it. If you want to handle non-string inputs or modify the word, you will need to add additional code. 

Also, the function name `word_len` is not very descriptive, it would be better to name it something like `is_odd_length` or `is_word_odd_length`. 

Finally, the function does not follow the PEP 8 style guide, it would be better to use spaces around the operators and to limit the length of the lines. 

Here is the function with the improvements:
```
def is_odd_length(word):
    return len(word) % 2 != 0
```
