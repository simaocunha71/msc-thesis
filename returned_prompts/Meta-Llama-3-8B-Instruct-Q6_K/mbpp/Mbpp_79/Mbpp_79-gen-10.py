def word_len(word):
    return len(word) % 2 != 0
```
In this problem, we are asked to write a function that checks whether the length of a given word is odd or not. The function should return `True` if the length is odd and `False` if the length is even.

The unit test `assert word_len("Hadoop") == False` suggests that the function should return `False` for a word of even length, which is a reasonable assumption.

The function `word_len(word)` uses the modulus operator `%` to find the remainder of the length of the word when divided by 2. If the remainder is not 0, the length is odd, and the function returns `True`. If the remainder is 0, the length is even, and the function returns `False`. This approach is simple and efficient. 

For example, if the word is "Hadoop", its length is 6, which is even. Therefore, the function returns `False`. If the word is "Python", its length is 6, which is even. Therefore, the function returns `False`. If the word is "A", its length is 1, which is odd. Therefore, the function returns `True`. 

This function works correctly for all words, regardless of their length or content. It simply checks the length of the word and returns a boolean value indicating whether the length is odd or even.
