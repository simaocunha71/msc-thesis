def word_len(word):
    return len(word) % 2 != 0
```
The given unit test `assert word_len("Hadoop") == False` suggests that the function should return `False` if the length of the word is odd. 

The function `word_len` takes a word as input and returns `True` if the length of the word is odd and `False` if the length of the word is even. The condition `len(word) % 2 != 0` checks whether the length of the word is odd or even. If the remainder when the length of the word is divided by 2 is not zero, then the length is odd. Otherwise, the length is even.  Therefore, the function `word_len` returns the opposite of the result of the condition, i.e., `False` if the length is odd and `True` if the length is even. 

The unit test `assert word_len("Hadoop") == False` passes because the length of the word "Hadoop" is 6, which is even. Therefore, the function `word_len` returns `False` for the word "Hadoop".  Similarly, the function `word_len` would return `True` for a word like "Hello" because its length is 5, which is odd.  Hence, the function `word_len` correctly identifies whether the length of the word is odd or even.
