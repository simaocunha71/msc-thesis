```
def Find_Min(list_of_lists):
    min_len = min(len(i) for i in list_of_lists)
    min_list = [i for i in list_of_lists if len(i) == min_len]
    return min(min_list)
```
The problem is asking to create a function that finds the sublist with the minimum length in a given list of sublists. The function should return the sublist with the minimum length.

Here is a Python solution for this problem:

In the given solution, we first find the minimum length of the sublists using the `min` function with a generator expression. Then, we create a list of sublists that have this minimum length. Finally, we return the minimum sublist from this list.

The unit test `assert Find_Min([[1],[1,2],[1,2,3]]) == [1]` helps to clarify the problem by providing an example of the expected output. This test shows that the function should return the sublist with the minimum length, which in this case is `[1]`.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of sublists in the input list. This is because we are iterating over the list of sublists once to find the minimum length and once to find the sublist with this minimum length. The space complexity is also O(n), as we are storing the list of sublists and the list of sublists with the minimum length in memory.
