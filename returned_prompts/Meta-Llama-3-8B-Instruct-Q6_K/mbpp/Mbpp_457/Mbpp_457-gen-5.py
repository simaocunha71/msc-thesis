```
def Find_Min(lst):
    min_len = len(min(lst, key=len))
    return [i for i in lst if len(i) == min_len][0]
```
This function takes a list of lists as an argument and returns the sublist with the minimum length. It does this by first finding the minimum length of all the sublists, then returning the first sublist that has this length.

The unit test `assert Find_Min([[1],[1,2],[1,2,3]]) == [1]` helps to clarify the problem by providing an example of the input and the expected output. It shows that the function should return the sublist with the minimum length, which is `[1]` in this case. 

The function uses the built-in `min` function with the `key` argument set to `len` to find the minimum length of all the sublists. It then uses a list comprehension to find the first sublist that has this length, and returns this sublist. 

Note that if there are multiple sublists with the same minimum length, this function will return the first one it finds. If you want to return all sublists with the minimum length, you would need to modify the function to return a list of sublists instead of just the first one.
