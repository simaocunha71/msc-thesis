```
def Find_Min(lst):
    min_len = min(len(sublist) for sublist in lst)
    return next(sublist for sublist in lst if len(sublist) == min_len)
```

Explanation:
The function `Find_Min` takes a list of lists (`lst`) as input. It first finds the minimum length of the sublists in the list using a generator expression. Then, it uses the `next` function to find the first sublist that has the minimum length. The result is the sublist with the minimum length.

The unit test `assert Find_Min([[1],[1,2],[1,2,3]]) == [1]` ensures that the function works correctly. It checks that the function returns the sublist `[1]`, which has the minimum length in the input list. 

This function assumes that the input list is not empty and contains at least one sublist. If the input list is empty or does not contain any sublists, the function will raise an error. To handle these cases, you could add error checking code to the function.  For example:
```
def Find_Min(lst):
    if not lst or not any(lst):
        return []
    min_len = min(len(sublist) for sublist in lst)
    return next(sublist for sublist in lst if len(sublist) == min_len)
```  This version of the function will return an empty list if the input list is empty or does not contain any sublists.  It will also return the first sublist if there are multiple sublists with the minimum length.  If you want to return all sublists with the minimum length, you could modify the function to return a list of all such sublists.  For example:
```
def Find_Min(lst):
    if not lst or not any(lst):
        return []
    min_len = min(len(sublist) for sublist in lst)
    return [sublist for sublist in lst if len(sublist) == min_len]
```  This version of the function will return a list of all sublists with the minimum length.  It will return an empty list if the input list is empty or does not contain any sublists.  It will also return the first sublist if there is only one sublist with the minimum length.  If there are multiple sublists with the minimum length and you want to return all of them, this version of the function will do that.  



```
def Find_Min(lst):
    min_len = min(len(sublist) for sublist in lst)
