```
def Find_Min(lst):
    min_len = min(len(sublist) for sublist in lst)
    min_sublist = [sublist for sublist in lst if len(sublist) == min_len][0]
    return min_sublist
```


Explanation:
The function `Find_Min` takes a list of lists as input. It first finds the minimum length of the sublists by using a generator expression inside the `min` function. Then, it finds the sublist with the minimum length by using another generator expression inside a list comprehension. The `[0]` at the end is used to get the first (and only) element of the list comprehension, as list comprehensions return a list. The function finally returns the sublist with the minimum length. 

The unit test `assert Find_Min([[1],[1,2],[1,2,3]]) == [1]` helps to understand the problem better. It indicates that the function should return the sublist with the minimum length, which in this case is `[1]`.
