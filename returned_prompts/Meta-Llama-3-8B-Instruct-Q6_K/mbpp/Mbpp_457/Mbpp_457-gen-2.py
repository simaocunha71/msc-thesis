def Find_Min(lst):
    return min(lst, key=len)
```
The problem is asking to write a Python function that finds the sublist with the minimum length from a given list of sublists. 

The unit test provided, `assert Find_Min([[1],[1,2],[1,2,3]]) == [1]`, helps to clarify the problem by showing that the function should return the sublist with the minimum length.

The solution uses the built-in `min` function with a `key` argument set to `len`, which tells `min` to find the minimum list based on the length of the lists. This is a simple and efficient solution.  It works by comparing the lengths of all the sublists in the input list and returning the sublist with the shortest length.  It is a common idiom in Python to use the `min` function with a `key` argument to find the minimum element of a list based on a specific criterion, such as length in this case.  This idiom is often used to simplify code and make it more readable.  It is also more efficient than writing a loop to find the minimum list, because it uses a built-in function that is implemented in C and is therefore faster than a Python loop.  It is a good practice to use the `min` function with a `key` argument whenever you need to find the minimum element of a list based on a specific criterion.  It is also a good practice to use the `max` function with a `key` argument whenever you need to find the maximum element of a list based on a specific criterion.  This is because these functions are designed to work with lists of any type of object, and they are therefore more flexible and easier to use than a loop.  They are also more efficient than a loop, because they use a built-in function that is implemented in C and is therefore faster than a Python loop.
