```
def Find_Min(lst):
    min_len = float('inf')
    min_lst = []
    for sub in lst:
        if len(sub) < min_len:
            min_len = len(sub)
            min_lst = sub
    return min_lst
```


The function `Find_Min` takes a list of lists as an argument. It iterates over each sublist in the list, and keeps track of the sublist with the minimum length. If a sublist is found with a length less than the current minimum, it updates the minimum length and the minimum sublist. Finally, it returns the minimum sublist. 

The unit test `assert Find_Min([[1],[1,2],[1,2,3]]) == [1]` ensures that the function works correctly. 

The time complexity of this function is O(n*m), where n is the number of sublists and m is the average length of the sublists. This is because the function iterates over each element in each sublist once. The space complexity is O(1), as the function only uses a constant amount of space to store the minimum length and the minimum sublist.
