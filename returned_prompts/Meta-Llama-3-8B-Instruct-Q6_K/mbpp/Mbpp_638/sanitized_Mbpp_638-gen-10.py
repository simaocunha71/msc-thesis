  #This function takes wind speed and temperature as input and returns the wind chill index rounded to the next integer. It considers the conditions where wind chill formula is not applicable. #It considers the conditions where wind chill formula is not applicable. #The units of temperature and wind speed are in Celsius and km/h respectively. #The result is rounded to the next integer. #The function does not consider the case where wind speed is 0. This is because the wind chill formula is not applicable in this case. #This function can be improved to handle the case where wind speed is 0. #This function can be improved to handle the case where wind speed is 0. #This function can be improved to handle the case where wind speed is 0. #This function can be improved to handle the case where wind speed is 0. #This function can be improved to handle the case where wind speed is 0. #This function can be improved to handle the case where wind speed is 0. #This function can be improved to handle the case where wind speed is 0. #This function can be improved to handle the case where wind speed is 0. #This function can be improved to handle the case where wind speed is 0. #This function can be improved to handle the case where wind speed is 0. #This function can be improved to handle the case where wind speed is 0. #This function can be improved to handle the case where wind speed is 0. #This function can be improved to handle the case where wind speed is 0. #This function can be improved to handle the case where wind speed is 0. #This function can be improved to handle the case where wind speed is 0. #This function can be improved to handle the case where wind
