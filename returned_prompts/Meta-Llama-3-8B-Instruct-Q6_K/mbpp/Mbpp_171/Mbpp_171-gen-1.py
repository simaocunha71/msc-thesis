The problem is asking to write a function that calculates the perimeter of a regular pentagon given the length of its sides. 

However, the problem description does not explicitly state that the pentagon is regular. But, we can make an assumption based on the unit test provided, `assert perimeter_pentagon(5) == 25`. This test suggests that the pentagon is regular, because the perimeter of a regular pentagon is the sum of its side lengths multiplied by 5.

Here is the Python function that solves the problem:
```
def perimeter_pentagon(side_length):
    return side_length * 5
```
