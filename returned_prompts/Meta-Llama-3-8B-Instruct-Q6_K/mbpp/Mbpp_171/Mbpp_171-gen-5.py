def perimeter_pentagon(side_length):
    return 5 * side_length
```
The problem is asking to write a function that calculates the perimeter of a regular pentagon given the length of its sides. 

In a regular pentagon, all sides are equal. The formula to calculate the perimeter of a regular polygon is the number of sides multiplied by the length of each side. In this case, the number of sides is 5, so the function would be `5 * side_length`.

The unit test `assert perimeter_pentagon(5) == 25` confirms this, as it checks if the function returns `25` when the side length is `5`, which is indeed the correct perimeter of a regular pentagon with side length `5`.
