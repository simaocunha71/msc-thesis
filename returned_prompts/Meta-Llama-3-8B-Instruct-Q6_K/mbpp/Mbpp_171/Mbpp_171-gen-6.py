The problem is asking to write a function that calculates the perimeter of a regular pentagon given the length of its sides. The perimeter of a pentagon is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. In this case, since the pentagon is regular, all its sides are of the same length.

The unit test `assert perimeter_pentagon(5) == 25` helps to understand the problem better. It implies that the function should take the length of one side as input and return the perimeter.

The solution is straightforward: the function takes the length of one side as input and returns 5 times the length of the side, since there are 5 sides in a pentagon. This is implemented in the `perimeter_pentagon` function.
