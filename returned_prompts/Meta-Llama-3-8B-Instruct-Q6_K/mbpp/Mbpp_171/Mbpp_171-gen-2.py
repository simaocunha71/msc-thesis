def perimeter_pentagon(side_length):
    return 5 * side_length
```
The perimeter of a regular pentagon is the sum of all its sides, which is 5 times the length of one side. The unit test `assert perimeter_pentagon(5) == 25` confirms this. 

So, the function `perimeter_pentagon` takes the length of one side as an argument and returns the perimeter of the pentagon. It does this by multiplying the side length by 5.
