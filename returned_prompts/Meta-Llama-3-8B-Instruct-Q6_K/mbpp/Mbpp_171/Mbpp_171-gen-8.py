```
def perimeter_pentagon(side_length):
    return side_length * 5
```


This function takes the length of the side of a regular pentagon as input and returns the perimeter. The perimeter of a regular polygon is calculated by multiplying the number of sides by the length of the side. In the case of a pentagon, the number of sides is 5. The unit test `assert perimeter_pentagon(5) == 25` verifies that the function returns the correct result for a pentagon with sides of length 5, which has a perimeter of 25.
