def perimeter_pentagon(side_length):
    return 5 * side_length
```


The problem asks to write a function that calculates the perimeter of a regular pentagon given the length of its sides. The formula for the perimeter of a regular polygon is the number of sides times the length of each side. In this case, the pentagon has 5 sides, so the function is simply `5 * side_length`. The unit test `assert perimeter_pentagon(5) == 25` confirms that the function works correctly. 

The function takes a single argument `side_length` which is the length of each side of the pentagon, and returns the perimeter of the pentagon. The perimeter is calculated by multiplying the number of sides (5) with the length of each side. 

This function assumes that the input is a positive integer, as the problem statement does not specify otherwise. If the input can be any real number, the function should handle it accordingly. For example, it could return `None` or raise an error if the input is not a positive integer. However, based on the unit test, it seems that the input is expected to be a positive integer. 

The function is simple and efficient, with a time complexity of O(1), as it only performs a constant number of operations. It is also easy to understand and use, making it a good solution for the problem.
