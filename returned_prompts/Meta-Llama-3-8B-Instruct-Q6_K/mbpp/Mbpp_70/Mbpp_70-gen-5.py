```
def get_equal(tuples):
    if len(set(map(len, tuples))) == 1:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```


The problem is asking you to write a function that takes a list of tuples as input and returns True if all the tuples have the same length, and False otherwise.

The provided unit test suggests that the function should return True for the input [(11, 22, 33), (44, 55, 66)], which means all the tuples in the list have the same length.

Here is a Python solution for the problem:

The function uses the built-in set and map functions to get a set of lengths of all tuples in the list. If the set contains only one element, it means all tuples have the same length, and the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

Here is the solution:

```
def get_equal(tuples):
    if len(set(map(len, tuples))) == 1:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```


You can test the function with the provided unit test:

```
assert get_equal([(11, 22, 33), (44, 55, 66)]) == True
```


This test should pass if the function is implemented correctly. If the function is not implemented correctly, the test will fail, and you can debug the function to find the mistake.
