```
def get_equal(tuples):
    if len(tuples) == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return len(tuples[0]) == len(tuples[1])
```
This function takes a list of tuples as an argument and checks if all the tuples have the same length. It first checks if the list is empty. If it is, it returns True because an empty list can be considered as all tuples having the same length. If the list is not empty, it checks if the length of the first tuple is equal to the length of the second tuple. If they are equal, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False. This function will only work correctly if the list contains at least two tuples. 

For example, if you call `get_equal([(11, 22, 33), (44, 55, 66)])`, it will return `True` because both tuples have the same length. If you call `get_equal([(11, 22, 33), (44, 55)])`, it will return `False` because the tuples have different lengths. 

The unit test `assert get_equal([(11, 22, 33), (44, 55, 66)]) == True` ensures that the function works correctly for tuples with the same length. However, it does not cover the case where the tuples have different lengths. To make the function more robust, you could add additional checks to handle this case. For example, you could iterate over the tuples and keep track of the length of the first tuple you encounter, then check if all the other tuples have the same length. Here is an updated version of the function:

```
def get_equal(tuples):
    if len(tuples) == 0:
        return True
    else:
        length = len(tuples[0])
        for tuple in tuples:
            if len(tuple) != length:
                return False
        return True
```
This function will return `True` if all the tuples have the same length, and `False` otherwise. It will work correctly even if the list contains tuples with different lengths. The unit test `assert get_equal([(11, 22, 33), (44, 55, 66)]) == True` will still pass, but the function will also work correctly for cases where the tuples have different lengths. For example, if you call `get_equal([(11, 22, 33), (44, 55)])`,
