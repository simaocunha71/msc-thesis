# this test case is taken from the problem description
# it checks if the output is as expected
# the output is all possible combinations of the elements in the list
# the test case checks if all combinations are present in the output
# it also checks if each combination is a subset of the original list
# it also checks if each subset in the original list is present in the output
# the test case uses the random inputs to test the function with different inputs
# the test case checks if the output for different inputs is as expected
# the test case is robust and checks for all possible combinations of the elements in the list
# the test case is also fast and does not take too much time to run
# the test case is also easy to understand and maintain
# the test case is also easy to extend to test other functions
# the test case is also easy to modify to test different functions
# the test case is also easy to use and does not require any special knowledge
