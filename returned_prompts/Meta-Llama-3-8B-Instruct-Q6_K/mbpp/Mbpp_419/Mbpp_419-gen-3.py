```
def round_and_sum(lst):
    rounded_list = [round(num) for num in lst]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_list)
    return total_sum * len(lst)
```





The problem is asking to create a function that takes a list of numbers, rounds each number to the nearest integer, and then returns the sum of the rounded numbers multiplied by the length of the list.

The unit test `assert round_and_sum([22.4, 4.0, -16.22, -9.10, 11.00, -12.22, 14.20, -5.20, 17.50])==243` helps to clarify the problem by providing an example of the expected output.

The solution uses a list comprehension to round each number in the list, and then calculates the total sum using the built-in `sum` function. The result is then multiplied by the length of the list using the `len` function and returned.
