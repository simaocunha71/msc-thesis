```
def round_and_sum(lst):
    rounded_nums = [round(num) for num in lst]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_nums)
    return total_sum * len(lst)
```


The unit test provided suggests that the function should round every number in the list and then calculate the sum of the rounded numbers. The function will then multiply the sum by the length of the list and return the result.

Here is the Python code that implements this:

```
def round_and_sum(lst):
    rounded_nums = [round(num) for num in lst]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_nums)
    return total_sum * len(lst)
```

This function uses list comprehension to create a new list with the numbers rounded to the nearest integer. It then calculates the sum of these rounded numbers using the built-in `sum` function. Finally, it multiplies the sum by the length of the original list and returns the result. The unit test provided, `assert round_and_sum([22.4, 4.0, -16.22, -9.10, 11.00, -12.22, 14.20, -5.20, 17.50])==243`, suggests that the function should return `243` for the given list of numbers. This is the case, so the function is correct.
