This function takes a list of numbers, rounds each number to its nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the original list. The unit test provided shows that this function should work correctly with a list of floating point numbers. 

The function uses a generator expression to round each number in the list, and the built-in sum function to calculate the total sum. It then multiplies this sum by the length of the list using the len function, which returns the number of items in an object. 

This function should work correctly for any list of numbers, whether they are integers or floating point numbers. 

For example, if the input list is [22.4, 4.0, -16.22, -9.10, 11.00, -12.22, 14.20, -5.20, 17.50], the function will round each number to its nearest integer, calculate the sum of these rounded numbers (243), and then multiply this sum by the length of the list (9), returning 2187. 

This function does not handle non-numeric values in the list, and will raise a TypeError if such values are present. It also does not handle empty lists, and will return 0 if an empty list is provided.  If you need to handle these cases, you could add error checking code to the function.  For example, you could use a try/except block to catch and handle TypeError exceptions, and you could return 0 for empty lists.  However, this would depend on the specific requirements of your program.  In general, it's a good idea to handle potential errors and edge cases in your code to make it more robust and reliable.
