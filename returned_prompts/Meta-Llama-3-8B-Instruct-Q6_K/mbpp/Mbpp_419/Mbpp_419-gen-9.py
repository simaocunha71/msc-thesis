```
def round_and_sum(lst):
    rounded_list = [round(i) for i in lst]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_list)
    return total_sum * len(lst)
```


In this problem, we are asked to write a function that takes a list of numbers as input, rounds each number to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then returns the sum multiplied by the length of the list.

The unit test provided is `assert round_and_sum([22.4, 4.0, -16.22, -9.10, 11.00, -12.22, 14.20, -5.20, 17.50])==243`. This test checks if the function correctly rounds the numbers, calculates the sum, and returns the correct result.

To solve this problem, we can use a list comprehension to round each number in the input list, then calculate the sum of these rounded numbers using the built-in `sum` function. Finally, we return the sum multiplied by the length of the list. Here is the Python code for this solution:

```
def round_and_sum(lst):
    rounded_list = [round(i) for i in lst]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_list)
    return total_sum * len(lst)
```

This function will pass the provided unit test, as it correctly rounds the numbers, calculates the sum, and returns the correct result. It is also general enough to work with lists of any length and any numbers.
