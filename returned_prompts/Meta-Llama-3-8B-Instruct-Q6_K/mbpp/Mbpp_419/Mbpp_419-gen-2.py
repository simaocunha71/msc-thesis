```
def round_and_sum(lst):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in lst]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    return total_sum * len(lst)
```


The given problem asks to create a function that takes a list of numbers, rounds each number to its nearest integer, and then calculates the total sum of the rounded numbers. The function should also multiply the total sum by the length of the list and return the result.

The provided unit test `assert round_and_sum([22.4, 4.0, -16.22, -9.10, 11.00, -12.22, 14.20, -5.20, 17.50])==243` helps to clarify the expected behavior of the function.

The solution uses a list comprehension to round each number in the input list and then calculates the total sum using the built-in `sum` function. The result is then multiplied by the length of the list using the `len` function. The final result is returned by the function.
