```
def removezero_ip(ip):
    return '.'.join(str(int(part)) for part in ip.split('.'))
```


The function works by splitting the IP address into four parts using the '.' as a separator, then converting each part into an integer, and finally joining the parts back together with '.' as a separator. This effectively removes any leading zeroes from the IP address. 

The unit test `assert removezero_ip("216.08.094.196")==('216.8.94.196')` ensures that the function works correctly.  It checks that the function removes the leading zeroes from the given IP address and returns the correct result. 

This function assumes that the input IP address is in the correct format (i.e., it has four parts separated by '.'). If the input IP address is not in the correct format, the function may not work correctly. 

Also, this function does not validate the IP address, it just removes the leading zeroes. If you want to validate the IP address, you would need to add additional checks.  For example, you could check that each part of the IP address is a valid number between 0 and 255.  You could also check that the IP address is not in the private IP address range.  These checks would add complexity to the function, but they would make it more robust and reliable.  Here is an example of how you could add these checks:

```
def removezero_ip(ip):
    parts = ip.split('.')
    if len(parts) != 4:
        raise ValueError("Invalid IP address")
    for part in parts:
        if not part.isdigit():
            raise ValueError("Invalid IP address")
        if int(part) > 255:
            raise ValueError("Invalid IP address")
    return '.'.join(str(int(part)) for part in ip.split('.'))
```

This version of the function adds checks to ensure that the input IP address is valid.  It checks that the IP address has four parts, that each part is a digit, and that each part is less than or equal to 255.  If the IP address is not valid, the function raises a ValueError with a message indicating that the IP address is invalid.  If the IP address is valid, the function removes the leading zeroes and returns the result.  This version of the function is more robust and reliable than the original version, but it is also more complex.  You would need to decide whether the added complexity is worth the improved reliability.  In general, it is
