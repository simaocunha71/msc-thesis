```
def removezero_ip(ip):
    return '.'.join(map(str, map(int, ip.split('.'))))
```



In this problem, we need to write a function that takes an IP address as a string, removes any leading zeroes, and returns the modified IP address as a string.

The given unit test `assert removezero_ip("216.08.094.196")==('216.8.94.196')` suggests that the function should split the IP address into four parts at the '.' characters, convert each part to an integer, remove any leading zeroes, and then join the parts back together with '.' characters in between.

Here is a Python function that accomplishes this:

```
def removezero_ip(ip):
    return '.'.join(map(str, map(int, ip.split('.'))))
```

This function works by first splitting the IP address into four parts at the '.' characters using the `split` method. It then uses the `map` function to convert each part to an integer and remove any leading zeroes. Finally, it uses the `join` method to join the parts back together with '.' characters in between, and returns the resulting string.
