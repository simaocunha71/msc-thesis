```
def removezero_ip(ip):
    return '.'.join(part.lstrip('0') or '0' for part in ip.split('.'))
```
The function `removezero_ip` takes an IP address as a string, splits it into four parts using the dot as a separator, removes leading zeroes from each part using the `lstrip` method, and joins the parts back together with dots in between. If a part becomes empty after removing leading zeroes (i.e., it was originally '000'), it replaces it with '0' to avoid an empty string in the resulting IP address. This is done using the `or '0'` part in the generator expression. The `join` method is then used to concatenate the parts back into a string. 
The unit test `assert removezero_ip("216.08.094.196")==('216.8.94.196')` ensures that the function works correctly. 
The function will return the IP address with leading zeroes removed. For example, `removezero_ip("216.08.094.196")` will return `'216.8.94.196'`. 





The function `removezero_ip` is designed to remove leading zeroes from an IP address, which is a string. It uses the following steps:

1.  It splits the IP address into four parts using the dot as a separator.
2.  It removes leading zeroes from each part using the `lstrip` method.
3.  If a part becomes empty after removing leading zeroes (i.e., it was originally '000'), it replaces it with '0' to avoid an empty string in the resulting IP address.
4.  It joins the parts back together with dots in between using the `join` method.

The function will return the IP address with leading zeroes removed. For example, `removezero_ip("216.08.094.196")` will return `'216.8.94.196'`. This ensures that the function works correctly and can handle IP addresses with leading zeroes.
