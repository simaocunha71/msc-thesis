```
def move_zero(lst):
    non_zero_elements = [element for element in lst if element != 0]
    zero_elements = [element for element in lst if element == 0]
    return non_zero_elements + zero_elements
```


Explanation:
This problem can be solved by using list comprehension to create two separate lists: one for non-zero elements and one for zero elements. Then, we concatenate these two lists to get the desired output. The unit test `assert move_zero([1,0,2,0,3,4]) == [1,2,3,4,0,0]` helps in understanding the expected output.  The function `move_zero` takes a list as an argument, separates the non-zero elements and zero elements and then returns the combined list.  This solution has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the number of elements in the list.  



Note: You can also solve this problem by using the built-in `sort` function in combination with a custom sorting key. This approach would also have a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting operation. Here's an example of how you could do it:

```
def move_zero(lst):
    return sorted((element for element in lst if element != 0) + [0] * lst.count(0))
```

This solution is less efficient than the previous one for large lists because it involves sorting, which is a more expensive operation than just separating the elements. However, it can be a good alternative if you're working with a list that is already partially sorted.  In that case, the `sort` function can take advantage of the existing order and move the zero elements to the end more efficiently.  The unit test `assert move_zero([1,0,2,0,3,4]) == [1,2,3,4,0,0]` still applies to this solution.  The function `move_zero` takes a list as an argument, sorts the non-zero elements and then appends the zero elements to the end, returning the combined list.  This solution also has a time complexity of O(n log n) where n is the number of elements in the list.  



Please note that the time complexity of the solution is not the only consideration when choosing an approach. The readability, maintainability and simplicity of the code are also important factors. The first solution I provided is simpler and more readable than the second one, but the second one
