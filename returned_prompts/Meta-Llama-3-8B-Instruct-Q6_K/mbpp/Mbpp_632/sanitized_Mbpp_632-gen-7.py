def move_zero(lst):
    return [i for i in lst if i != 0] + [i for i in lst if i == 0]  # This function works by first creating a list of non-zero elements and then a list of zero elements. It then combines these lists to form the output. This approach ensures that all zeroes are moved to the end of the list.  # This is a more readable and Pythonic solution.  # The function can be used as follows:  # print(move_zero([1,0,2,0,3,4]))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 0]  # This function works by first creating a list of non-zero elements and then a list of zero elements.
