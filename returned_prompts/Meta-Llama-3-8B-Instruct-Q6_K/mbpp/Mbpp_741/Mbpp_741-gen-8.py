def all_Characters_Same(s):
    return len(set(s)) == 1
```
The function all_Characters_Same() takes a string s as input and returns True if all characters in the string are the same, and False otherwise.

The function works by converting the string into a set (which is an unordered collection of unique elements), and then checking if the length of the set is equal to 1. If the length of the set is 1, it means that all characters in the string are the same, and the function returns True. If the length of the set is not 1, it means that there are different characters in the string, and the function returns False.

For example, if the input string is "python", the function will return False because there are different characters in the string. If the input string is "aaaa", the function will return True because all characters in the string are the same.  # Corrected the function as per the problem statement.
