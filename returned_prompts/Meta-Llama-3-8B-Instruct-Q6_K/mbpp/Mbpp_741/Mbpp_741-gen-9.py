def all_Characters_Same(s):
    return len(set(s)) == 1
```


The function `all_Characters_Same(s)` checks if all characters in the string `s` are the same. It does this by converting the string to a set, which removes any duplicate characters. If the length of the set is 1, then all characters in the string are the same. Otherwise, they are not. The function returns a boolean value indicating this.

The unit test `assert all_Characters_Same("python") == False` suggests that the function should return `False` for the string "python", which contains more than one unique character. 

For example, the string "aaa" would return `True` because all characters are the same, while "python" would return `False` because not all characters are the same.
