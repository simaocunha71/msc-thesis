```
def all_Characters_Same(s):
    return len(set(s)) == 1
```
The problem is asking to write a function that checks whether all the characters in a given string are the same or not. The function should return True if all characters are the same and False otherwise.

The unit test provided, `assert all_Characters_Same("python") == False`, suggests that the function should return False for strings with different characters.

Here's a Python function that solves the problem:

```
def all_Characters_Same(s):
    return len(set(s)) == 1
```

This function works by converting the input string to a set, which removes duplicate characters. If the length of the set is 1, it means that all characters in the original string were the same. Otherwise, the function returns False.
