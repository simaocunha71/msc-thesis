The problem is asking to write a function that checks whether all the characters in a given string are the same or not.

The unit test `assert all_Characters_Same("python") == False` suggests that the function should return `False` when all characters are not the same.

Here's a simple Python function to solve this problem:

```python
def all_Characters_Same(s):
    return len(set(s)) == 1
```

This function works by converting the string `s` into a set, which removes any duplicate characters. If the length of the set is 1, then all characters in the string are the same. Otherwise, the function returns `False`. 

For example, `all_Characters_Same("aaaa")` returns `True` because all characters are the same, and `all_Characters_Same("python")` returns `False` because not all characters are the same.
