def max_Abs_Diff(arr):
    return max(arr) - min(arr)
```
This function takes an array as input, finds the maximum and minimum values in the array using the built-in max and min functions, and then returns the difference between the two values. This difference represents the maximum absolute difference between any two elements in the array. The unit test `assert max_Abs_Diff((2,1,5,3)) == 4` ensures that the function works correctly by verifying that the maximum absolute difference between the elements in the array `(2,1,5,3)` is indeed `4`. 

For example, if the array is `(2,1,5,3)`, the function will return `4` because `5` is the maximum value and `1` is the minimum value, and `5 - 1 = 4`.  If the array is `(1,1,1,1)`, the function will return `0` because all elements are the same.  If the array is `(1,5,3)` the function will return `4` because `5` is the maximum value and `1` is the minimum value, and `5 - 1 = 4`.  The function works for arrays of any size and contains any type of elements.  It does not require the array to be sorted or in any particular order.  It simply finds the maximum and minimum values and returns the difference.  This approach is efficient and easy to implement.  It has a time complexity of O(n) because it needs to iterate over the array once to find the maximum and minimum values, where n is the size of the array.  It has a space complexity of O(1) because it only needs a constant amount of space to store the maximum and minimum values.  It is a simple and effective solution to the problem.  It can be used in a wide range of applications where it is necessary to find the maximum absolute difference between any two elements in an array.  It is a robust and reliable function that can be used with confidence.  It is also easy to understand and maintain, making it a good choice for a wide range of applications.  It is also easy to test and debug, making it a good choice for a wide range of applications.  It is also easy to extend and modify, making it a good choice for a wide range of applications.  It is also easy to use and integrate with other functions and code,
