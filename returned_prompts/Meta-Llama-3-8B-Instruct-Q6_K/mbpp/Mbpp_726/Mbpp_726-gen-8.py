def multiply_elements(t):
    return tuple(t[i] * t[i+1] for i in range(len(t)-1))
```





Python function that takes a tuple of numbers as input and returns a tuple of length N-1 where the i-th element of the tuple is equal to the product of the i-th and (i+1)-th elements of the input tuple. The product is calculated before the tuple is returned. 

For example, if the input tuple is (1, 5, 7, 8, 10), the function returns (5, 35, 56, 80) because 1*5 = 5, 5*7 = 35, 7*8 = 56, and 8*10 = 80. 

The unit test `assert multiply_elements((1, 5, 7, 8, 10)) == (5, 35, 56, 80)` ensures that the function works correctly for this specific input. 

The function uses a generator expression to iterate over the indices of the input tuple (excluding the last one), calculates the product of the i-th and (i+1)-th elements, and returns the result as a tuple. 

The `range(len(t)-1)` expression generates indices from 0 to N-2, where N is the length of the input tuple. The `t[i] * t[i+1]` expression calculates the product of the i-th and (i+1)-th elements. The `tuple(...)` function converts the generator expression into a tuple. 

The function is implemented in a way that is easy to understand and maintain, and it passes the given unit test.
