```
def multiply_elements(t):
    result = ()
    for i in range(len(t) - 1):
        result += (t[i] * t[i+1],)
    return result
```


The problem asks you to create a function that takes a tuple of numbers and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of two adjacent elements from the original tuple.

The unit test `assert multiply_elements((1, 5, 7, 8, 10)) == (5, 35, 56, 80)` helps to clarify the problem by showing that the function should multiply each element in the tuple with the next one, except for the last element which will be multiplied with the first one (since the tuple is circular).

Here's a Python solution that uses a for loop to iterate over the tuple, multiplying each element with the next one, and then returns the resulting tuple:

```
def multiply_elements(t):
    result = ()
    for i in range(len(t) - 1):
        result += (t[i] * t[i+1],)
    return result
```


This function initializes an empty tuple `result`, then iterates over the input tuple `t` using a for loop. For each iteration, it multiplies the current element `t[i]` with the next element `t[i+1]`, and adds the result to the `result` tuple. Finally, it returns the `result` tuple.
