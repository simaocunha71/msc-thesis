The problem is asking to create a function that takes a tuple of numbers as input and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of the corresponding input elements. For example, if the input tuple is (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), the output tuple would be (2, 6, 12, 20).

The unit test `assert multiply_elements((1, 5, 7, 8, 10)) == (5, 35, 56, 80)` helps to understand the problem better. It shows that the function should multiply each element with the next one in the tuple.

Here is the solution:
```python
def multiply_elements(t):
    result = ()
    for i in range(len(t) - 1):
        result += (t[i] * t[i + 1],)
    return result
```
This function iterates over the input tuple, multiplying each element with the next one, and adds the result to the `result` tuple. The `result` tuple is then returned as the output. The `range(len(t) - 1)` ensures that the last element of the tuple is not multiplied with the next one (which does not exist), as the problem statement does not specify what to do in this case. The unit test `assert multiply_elements((1, 5, 7, 8, 10)) == (5, 35, 56, 80)` passes with this solution.
