```
def multiply_elements(t):
    return tuple(t[i] * t[i+1] for i in range(len(t)-1))
```


The function `multiply_elements` takes a tuple `t` as input and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of the corresponding elements in the input tuple. The `range(len(t)-1)` is used to iterate over the indices of the input tuple, and `t[i] * t[i+1]` is used to compute the product of the `i`-th and `(i+1)`-th elements. The result is then converted to a tuple using the `tuple` function. This solution passes the given unit test.
