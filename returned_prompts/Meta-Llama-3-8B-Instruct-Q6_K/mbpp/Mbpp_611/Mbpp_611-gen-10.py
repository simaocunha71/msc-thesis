```
def max_of_nth(matrix, n):
    return max(row[n] for row in matrix)
```
The function takes a matrix represented as a list of lists and an integer n as input. It returns the maximum value in the n'th column of the matrix. 

The unit test `assert max_of_nth([[5, 6, 7], [1, 3, 5], [8, 9, 19]], 2) == 19` ensures that the function works correctly. 

The function uses a generator expression to iterate over each row in the matrix, and for each row, it extracts the n'th element and returns the maximum of these elements. 

For example, if the input matrix is `[[5, 6, 7], [1, 3, 5], [8, 9, 19]]` and `n` is 2, the function will return `19` which is the maximum value in the 2nd column. 
```python
max_of_nth([[5, 6, 7], [1, 3, 5], [8, 9, 19]], 2)  # returns 19
