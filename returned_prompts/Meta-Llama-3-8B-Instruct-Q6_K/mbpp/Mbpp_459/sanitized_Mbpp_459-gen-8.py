    # This will also remove spaces from the string
    # The problem statement does not mention if we need to remove spaces or not, 
    # so the above solution is based on the assumption that spaces should be removed. 
    # If spaces are not to be removed, then the original solution is fine. 
    # But if you want to remove spaces as well, then the second solution is the correct one. 
    # If you want to keep the spaces, then the first solution is the correct one. 
    # If you want to remove spaces but keep the punctuation, then the first solution is the correct one. 
    # If you want to remove punctuation as well, then you will need a more complex solution. 
    # But the problem statement does not mention anything about punctuation, so we can assume it does not need to be removed. 
    # However, in a real-world scenario, you may need to remove punctuation as well. 
    # So, you may need to add a condition to check if the character is a punctuation mark or not. 
    # But the problem statement does not mention this, so we can assume it is not needed. 
    # So, the solution is based on the assumption that spaces should be removed.
