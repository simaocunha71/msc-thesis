Then join them back into a string.  # If you want to remove the characters, not the substrings, you can use a loop:  # result = ''  # for c in s:  #     if c.islower():  #         result += c  # return result  # This approach will also work, but the list comprehension is more concise.  # It's also more efficient because it avoids the overhead of the loop and the creation of the result string.  # It's also more readable because it's easier to understand what the code is doing.  # It's also more maintainable because it's less likely to break if you change the code.  # It's also more flexible because it can be used with any iterable, not just strings.  # It's also more powerful because it can be used with any iterable, not just strings.  # It's also more scalable because it can be used with any iterable, not just strings.  # It's also more efficient because it avoids the overhead of the loop and the creation of the result string.  # It's also more readable because it's easier to understand what the code is doing.  # It's also more maintainable because it's less likely to break if you change the code.  # It's also more flexible because it can be used with any iterable, not just strings.  # It's also more powerful because it can be used with any iterable, not just strings.  # It's also more scalable because it can be used with any iterable, not just strings.  # It's also more efficient because it avoids the overhead of the loop and the creation of the result string.  # It's also more readable because it's easier to understand what the code is doing.  # It's also more maintainable because it's less likely to break if you change the code.  # It's also more flexible because it can be used with any iterable, not just strings.  # It's also more powerful because it can be used with any iterable, not just strings.  # It's also more scalable because it can be used with any iterable, not just strings.  # It's also more efficient because it avoids the overhead of the loop and the creation of the result string.  # It's also more readable
