```
def remove_uppercase(s):
    return ''.join(c for c in s if not c.isupper())
```



This problem asks you to write a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string where all uppercase characters are removed.

The unit test provided helps to clarify the problem by giving an example of what the function should do. It shows that the function should return 'cstyoravoitshos' when given the string 'cAstyoUrFavoRitETVshoWs'.

The solution to this problem is to use a generator expression to iterate over each character in the input string. For each character, use the `isupper()` method to check if it is uppercase. If it is not uppercase, add it to the output string. The `join()` method is then used to concatenate all the characters in the output string into a single string.

Here is the solution in Python:
```
def remove_uppercase(s):
    return ''.join(c for c in s if not c.isupper())
```
This function uses a generator expression to iterate over each character `c` in the input string `s`. For each character, it checks if `c.isupper()` is `False`, which means the character is not uppercase. If the character is not uppercase, it adds it to the output string using the `join()` method. The resulting string is then returned as the output of the function.
