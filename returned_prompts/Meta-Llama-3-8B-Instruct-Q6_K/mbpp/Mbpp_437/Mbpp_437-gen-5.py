    return "".join([i for i in s if int(i)%2==0])
```
The function `remove_odd(s)` takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string with all odd characters removed. 

The unit test `assert remove_odd("python")==("yhn")` helps to understand the problem better. It means that the function should remove all characters that have odd ASCII values from the input string. For example, the ASCII value of 'p' is 112, which is even, so it should be kept in the output string. The ASCII values of 'y', 'h', 'n' are 121, 104, 110, which are all even, so they should be kept in the output string. The ASCII values of 't', 'o', 'o' are 116, 111, 111, which are all odd, so they should be removed from the output string.

The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters in the input string. For each character, it checks if the ASCII value of the character is even by using the expression `int(i)%2==0`. If the character has an even ASCII value, it is included in the new string; otherwise, it is not. The `join` function is then used to concatenate the characters in the list into a single string. 

This function works for any string, not just English strings. It treats each character as a single unit, without considering its meaning or linguistic properties. It simply removes characters with odd ASCII values and keeps characters with even ASCII values.
