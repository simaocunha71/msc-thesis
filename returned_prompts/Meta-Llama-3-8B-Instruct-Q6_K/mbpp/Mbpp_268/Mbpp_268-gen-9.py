The problem is asking to write a function that finds the nth star number. A star number is a number that is a sum of the first n natural numbers. For example, the first star number is 1, the second star number is 3, the third star number is 6, and so on.

The unit test `assert find_star_num(3) == 37` suggests that the function should return the nth star number.

Here is a Python function that solves this problem:
```
def find_star_num(n):
    return sum(range(1, n+1))
```
This function uses the built-in `sum` function and the `range` function to calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers. The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to n, and the `sum` function adds them up.

For example, `find_star_num(3)` returns 6, which is the sum of the first 3 natural numbers (1 + 2 + 3). `find_star_num(4)` returns 10, which is the sum of the first 4 natural numbers (1 + 2 + 3 + 4). And so on.
