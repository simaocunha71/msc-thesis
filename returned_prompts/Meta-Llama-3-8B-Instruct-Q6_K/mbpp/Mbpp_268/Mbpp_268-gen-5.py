The problem asks to create a function that finds the nth star number. A star number is a number that is one more than a multiple of the sum of its digits. For example, the sum of digits of 9 is 9, and 9 + 1 = 10, which is a star number.

The unit test `assert find_star_num(3) == 37` suggests that the function should return the 3rd star number, which is 37.

Here is a Python function that solves the problem:
```
def find_star_num(n):
    star_nums = []
    i = 1
    while len(star_nums) < n:
        if sum(int(digit) for digit in str(i)) + 1 == i:
            star_nums.append(i)
        i += 1
    return star_nums[-1]
```
This function works by iterating over all positive integers and checking if each number is a star number. It keeps track of the star numbers it finds in a list and returns the nth star number when it has found n star numbers. The function uses a generator expression to calculate the sum of the digits of each number. The function stops iterating when it has found n star numbers and returns the last star number it found.
