```
def and_tuples(t1, t2):
    result = ()
    for a, b in zip(t1, t2):
        if a and b:
            result += (1,)
        else:
            result += (0,)
    return result
```





The problem asks you to create a function that takes two tuples as input and returns a new tuple. The new tuple contains 0s and 1s, where 1 represents the elementwise AND operation between the corresponding elements of the input tuples, and 0 represents the absence of a corresponding element in the input tuples.

For example, if the input tuples are (10, 4, 6, 9) and (5, 2, 3, 3), the output tuple should be (0, 0, 2, 1).

Here's a Python function that solves this problem:

```
def and_tuples(t1, t2):
    result = ()
    for a, b in zip(t1, t2):
        if a and b:
            result += (1,)
        else:
            result += (0,)
    return result
```

This function uses the built-in `zip` function to iterate over the corresponding elements of the input tuples. For each pair of elements, it checks if both elements are 1 (True). If they are, it adds a 1 to the result tuple; otherwise, it adds a 0. The function finally returns the result tuple.
