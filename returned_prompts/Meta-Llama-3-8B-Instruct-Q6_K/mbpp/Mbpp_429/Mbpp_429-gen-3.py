def and_tuples(t1, t2):
    result = []

This function takes two tuples as input and returns a new tuple containing the elementwise AND of the input tuples. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over the minimum of the lengths of the two input tuples, and for each index, it uses the bitwise AND operator (&) to combine the corresponding elements of the two tuples. The resulting list is then converted to a tuple and returned. The unit test provided in the problem statement ensures that the function works correctly for tuples of different lengths. For example, the test `assert and_tuples((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (0, 0, 2, 1)` checks that the function returns the correct result for two tuples of different lengths.
