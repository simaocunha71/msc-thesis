```
def and_tuples(t1, t2):
    result = []
    for i, j in zip(t1, t2):
        if i and j:
            result.append(t1.index(i))
    return tuple(result)
```




The function `and_tuples` takes two tuples as input and returns a tuple of indices where the elements in both tuples are True. It uses the built-in function `zip` to iterate over the elements of both tuples in parallel. For each pair of elements, it checks if both are True, and if so, it appends the index of the element in the first tuple to the result list. Finally, it returns the result as a tuple. The unit test `assert and_tuples((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (0, 0, 2, 1)` ensures that the function works correctly.
