```
def and_tuples(t1, t2):
    result = [i for i, (x, y) in enumerate(zip(t1, t2)) if x & y]
    return tuple(result)
```





The task is to write a function that takes two tuples as input and returns a new tuple containing the indices of the elements where the corresponding elements in the input tuples have a bitwise AND operation result of 1.

The unit test `assert and_tuples((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (0, 0, 2, 1)` suggests that the function should return a tuple of indices where the corresponding elements in the input tuples have a bitwise AND operation result of 1.

Here is a Python solution for the problem:

```
def and_tuples(t1, t2):
    result = [i for i, (x, y) in enumerate(zip(t1, t2)) if x & y]
    return tuple(result)
```

This function uses the built-in `zip` function to iterate over the elements of the input tuples in parallel. For each pair of elements, it checks if the bitwise AND operation result is 1, and if so, adds the index of the element to the result list. Finally, it converts the result list to a tuple and returns it.
