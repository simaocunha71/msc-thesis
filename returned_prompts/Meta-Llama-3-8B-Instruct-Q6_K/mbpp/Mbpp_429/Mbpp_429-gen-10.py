```
def and_tuples(t1, t2):
    return tuple(t1[i] & t2[i] for i in range(min(len(t1), len(t2))))
```





The problem is asking to create a function that takes two tuples as input and returns a new tuple. This new tuple should contain the element-wise AND operation of the corresponding elements from the input tuples. If the tuples are of different lengths, the function should stop when it reaches the end of the shorter tuple.

For example, if the input tuples are (10, 4, 6, 9) and (5, 2, 3, 3), the function should return (0, 0, 2, 1) because 10 & 5 = 0, 4 & 2 = 0, 6 & 3 = 2, and 9 & 3 = 1.

Here is a Python solution for this problem:
```
def and_tuples(t1, t2):
    return tuple(t1[i] & t2[i] for i in range(min(len(t1), len(t2))))
```
This function uses a generator expression to iterate over the indices of the shorter tuple (using the `min` function to find the length of the shorter tuple), and for each index, it performs the element-wise AND operation on the corresponding elements of the two tuples. The result is a new tuple containing the AND results.
