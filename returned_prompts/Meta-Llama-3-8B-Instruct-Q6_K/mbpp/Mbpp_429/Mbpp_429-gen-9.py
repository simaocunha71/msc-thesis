```
def and_tuples(t1, t2):
    result = []
    for x, y in zip(t1, t2):
        if x and y:
            result.append(t1.index(x))
    return tuple(result)
```


```
assert and_tuples((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (2,)
```


The problem is asking to create a function that takes two tuples as input and returns a tuple containing the indices of the elements that are present in both tuples. The function should use the AND operator (&) to find the common elements between the two tuples.


The unit test `assert and_tuples((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (2,)` helps to clarify the problem by providing an example of the expected output.


The solution is to iterate over the elements of the two tuples using the `zip` function, and for each pair of elements, check if both elements are present in both tuples using the AND operator. If both elements are present, add the index of the element in the first tuple to the result list. Finally, return the result list as a tuple.
