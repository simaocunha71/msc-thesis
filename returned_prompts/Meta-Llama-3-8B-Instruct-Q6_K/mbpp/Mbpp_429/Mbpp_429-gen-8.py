```
def and_tuples(t1, t2):
    return tuple(i for i, (x, y) in enumerate(zip(t1, t2)) if x and y)
```
The function `and_tuples` takes two tuples `t1` and `t2` as input. It uses the `zip` function to iterate over the elements of both tuples in parallel. The `enumerate` function is used to get both the index and value of each element. The condition `if x and y` is used to check if both elements are true, and if so, the index is added to the result list. The result is then converted to a tuple using the `tuple` function.

The unit test `assert and_tuples((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (0, 0, 2, 1)` ensures that the function works correctly. It checks that the output of the function for the input tuples `(10, 4, 6, 9)` and `(5, 2, 3, 3)` is `(0, 0, 2, 1)`. This is because the elements at indices 0 and 2 of both tuples are true, and the element at index 1 of the first tuple is true, but the element at index 1 of the second tuple is false. Therefore, the output is `(0, 0, 2, 1)`.
