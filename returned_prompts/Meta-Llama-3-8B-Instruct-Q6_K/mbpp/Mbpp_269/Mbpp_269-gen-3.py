```
def ascii_value(char):
    return ord(char)
```


The problem is asking you to create a function that takes a character as input and returns its ASCII value. 

The unit test provided, `assert ascii_value('A')==65`, suggests that the function should work for uppercase letters as well.

The built-in Python function `ord()` can be used to get the ASCII value of a character. This function takes a single character as input and returns its Unicode code point. 

So, the solution is a simple function that takes a character as input and returns the result of `ord()` applied to that character. Here's the code:

```
def ascii_value(char):
    return ord(char)
```
This function will work for any single character input, including uppercase letters, digits, and special characters. It will return the ASCII value of the character as an integer.  For example, `ascii_value('A')` will return `65`, `ascii_value('a')` will return `97`, and so on.  If the input is not a single character, the function may raise a TypeError or return a different value depending on the input.  For example, `ascii_value('Hello')` will raise a TypeError because 'Hello' is not a single character.  However, the function is designed to work correctly for a single character input.  If you need to handle non-single character inputs or other types of errors, you would need to add additional error handling code.  For example, you could add a try/except block to catch and handle TypeError exceptions.  Here's an example of how you could modify the function to handle non-single character inputs:

```
def ascii_value(char):
    try:
        return ord(char)
    except TypeError:
        return "Error: Input must be a single character"
```  This modified function will return an error message if the input is not a single character, rather than raising a TypeError.  It will still return the ASCII value of the character if the input is a single character.  You could add additional error handling code as needed to handle other types of errors or edge cases.  For example, you could add a check to make sure the input is a string, or to handle non-ASCII characters.  Here's an example of how you could modify the function to handle non-ASCII characters:

```
def ascii_value(char):
    try:
        return ord(char)
    except TypeError:
        return "Error: Input must be a single character"
