```
def ascii_value(char):
    return ord(char)
```
This function uses the built-in Python function `ord()` which returns an integer representing the Unicode character. The Unicode character is represented as a number. The function `ascii_value()` takes a character as an argument and returns the ASCII value of that character.

For example, `ascii_value('A')` would return `65` because the ASCII value of 'A' is `65`. Similarly, `ascii_value('a')` would return `97` because the ASCII value of 'a' is `97`.
