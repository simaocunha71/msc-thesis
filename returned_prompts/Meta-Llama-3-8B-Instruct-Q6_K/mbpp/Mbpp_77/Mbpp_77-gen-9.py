```
def is_Diff(n):
    return (n % 11) == 0
```





The problem is asking to create a function that determines whether a given number is divisible by 11 or not. 

However, the problem description seems to be missing some information. It doesn't specify what kind of result is expected. 

Fortunately, the unit test provided gives us a hint. It expects the function to return False for the input 12345, which means the function should return a boolean value indicating whether the number is divisible by 11 or not.

Here's a simple Python function that fulfills this requirement:

```
def is_Diff(n):
    return (n % 11) == 0
```

This function uses the modulus operator `%` to find the remainder of the division of `n` by 11. If the remainder is 0, then `n` is divisible by 11, and the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
