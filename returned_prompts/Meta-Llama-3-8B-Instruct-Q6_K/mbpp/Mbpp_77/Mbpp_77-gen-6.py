The problem is asking you to write a function that determines if a given number is divisible by 11. The function should return a boolean value (True or False).

The provided unit test `assert is_Diff (12345) == False` suggests that the function should return False for the number 12345, which is not divisible by 11.

Here's a Python function that solves the problem. The function converts the number to a string, then calculates the sum of its digits using a generator expression. Finally, it checks if the sum is divisible by 11 and returns the result. 

For example, for the number 12345, the function will calculate the sum of its digits (1+2+3+4+5 = 15) and check if 15 is divisible by 11, which is not the case. Therefore, the function will return False. 

On the other hand, for the number 110, the function will calculate the sum of its digits (1+1+0 = 2) and check if 2 is divisible by 11, which is the case. Therefore, the function will return True.
