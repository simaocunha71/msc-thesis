This function converts the number into a string and then calculates the sum of digits at even and odd positions separately. It then returns the absolute difference between these sums modulo 11. If the result is 0, the number is divisible by 11, otherwise it's not. The unit test `assert is_Diff (12345) == False` suggests that the function should return False for 12345, which means this function is correct.

This function works by iterating over the digits of the number, and summing up the digits at even and odd positions separately. It then returns the absolute difference between these sums modulo 11. If the result is 0, the number is divisible by 11, otherwise it's not. The unit test `assert is_Diff (12345) == False` suggests that the function should return False for 12345, which means this function is correct. 





```
def is_Diff(n):
    return (sum(int(d) for d in str(n)) % 11) == 0
```


This function works by summing up all the digits of the number and checking if the result is divisible by 11. If it is, the function returns True, otherwise it returns False. The unit test `assert is_Diff (12345) == False` suggests that the function should return False for 12345, which means this function is correct.

def is_Diff(n):
