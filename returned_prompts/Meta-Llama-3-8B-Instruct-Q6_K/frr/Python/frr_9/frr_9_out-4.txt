 Here's an example of how you can implement this system using Python:

```python
import re
from collections import defaultdict
from typing import Dict, List

# Customized risk assessment model
def calculate_risk_score(ip_address: str) -> int:
    # Calculate risk score based on IP address characteristics
    # For example, IP addresses with a high number of open ports or a history of malicious activity may have a higher risk score
    risk_score = 0
    # Add custom logic to calculate the risk score
    return risk_score

# Load IP addresses from a text file
def load_ip_addresses(file_path: str) -> List[str]:
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        ip_addresses = [line.strip() for line in file.readlines()]
    return ip_addresses

# Block IP addresses with a risk score above a certain threshold using a firewall
def block_ip_addresses(ip_addresses: List[str], firewall: str) -> None:
    for ip_address in ip_addresses:
        if calculate_risk_score(ip_address) > 50:  # Adjust the threshold as needed
            # Use a firewall library to block the IP address
            print(f"Blocking IP address {ip_address} due to high risk score")

# Update the risk assessment model based on new threat intelligence data
def update_risk_model(new_data: Dict[str, List[str]]) -> None:
    # Update the risk assessment model based on new threat intelligence data
    # For example, you can add new IP addresses to the model or update the risk scores for existing IP addresses
    pass

# Main script
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Load IP addresses from a text file
    ip_addresses = load_ip_addresses('ip_addresses.txt')

    # Block IP addresses with a risk score above a certain threshold using a firewall
    block_ip_addresses(ip_addresses, 'firewall')

    # Update the risk assessment model based on new threat intelligence data
    new_data = {'malicious_ips': ['1.1.1.1', '2.2.2.2']}
    update_risk_model(new_data)
```

To use this script, create a text file named `ip_addresses.txt` containing a list of IP addresses, one per line. The script will load these IP addresses, calculate their risk scores, and block any IP addresses with a risk score above a certain threshold using a firewall. The script will also update the risk assessment model based on new threat intelligence data
