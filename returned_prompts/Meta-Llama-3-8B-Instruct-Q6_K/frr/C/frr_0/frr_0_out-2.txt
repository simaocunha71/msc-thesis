 Here is a basic outline of the system:

1.  **Network Traffic Capture:** Use a library like libpcap or WinPcap to capture network traffic at the network interface level.

2.  **Packet Analysis:** Analyze each captured packet and extract relevant information such as source and destination IP addresses, ports, protocol, and packet contents.

3.  **Rule-Based Filtering:** Apply predefined rules to classify packets as either legitimate or malicious. The rules should be based on a combination of heuristics and machine learning algorithms.

4.  **Machine Learning Algorithm:** Implement a machine learning algorithm such as Naive Bayes or Random Forest to classify packets based on their features.

5.  **Rule Update:** Provide a mechanism for human analysts to update the ruleset based on new threat information.

6.  **Blocking Mechanism:** Implement a mechanism to block malicious packets based on the classification results.

Here is a basic C program that captures network traffic and applies a simple rule-based filtering system:
```c
#include <pcap.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

// Define a structure to represent a packet
typedef struct {
    u_char* packet;
    int length;
} packet_t;

// Define a structure to represent a rule
typedef struct {
    u_char* src_ip;
    u_char* dst_ip;
    u_short src_port;
    u_short dst_port;
    u_char protocol;
    int action; // 0: allow, 1: block
} rule_t;

// Initialize the packet capture context
pcap_t* pcap_ctx = NULL;

// Initialize the rule list
rule_t* rules = NULL;
int num_rules = 0;

// Capture network traffic
int capture_packets(int num_packets) {
    char errbuf[PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE];
    struct pcap_pkthdr* pkthdr;
    const u_char* packet;

    // Open the network interface
    pcap_ctx = pcap_open_live("eth0", 1024, 1, 1000, errbuf);
    if (pcap_ctx == NULL) {
        printf("Error opening network interface: %s\n", errbuf);
        return -1;
    }

    // Capture packets
    for (int i = 0; i < num_packets; i++) {
        packet = pcap_next(pcap_ctx, &pkthdr);
        if (packet == NULL) {
            printf("No packets captured\n");
            break;
        }
