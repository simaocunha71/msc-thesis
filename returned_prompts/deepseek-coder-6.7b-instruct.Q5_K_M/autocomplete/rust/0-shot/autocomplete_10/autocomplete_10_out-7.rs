# Explanation

The code above tries to open the file at the path given by the `path` variable in the following order:

1. It first checks if the `BROWSER` environment variable is set. If it is, it tries to open the file with the browser specified by this variable. If it succeeds, it returns "xdg-open" as the method. If it fails, it adds "xdg-open" to the list of methods.

2. It then tries to open the file with the commands "xdg-open", "gnome-open", and "kde-open". If it succeeds with any of these, it returns the command as the method. If it fails with all of them, it adds all of them to the list of methods.

3. If the list of methods is not empty at the end of the loop, it returns a string with all the methods joined by commas.

4. If none of the above methods worked, it returns an error message saying "No open method found".
