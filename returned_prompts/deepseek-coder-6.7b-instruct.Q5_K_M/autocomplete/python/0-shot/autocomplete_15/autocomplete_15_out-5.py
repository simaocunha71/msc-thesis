The `prepare_new_asset_type` method is not provided, but the `jsonpickle` library is used to convert the dictionary to a json string. The `sys.version_info` is used to determine if the python version is greater than 3.

### Answer
The `prepare_new_asset_type` method is not provided, but it seems like it is responsible for preparing some kind of new asset type. The code you provided is making a POST request to a specified URL, sending some data in the body of the request, and then logging the response. The data is being sent as a JSON string.

If the `prepare_new_asset_type` method is supposed to return a dictionary that will be converted to JSON, you could replace the call to `self.prepare_new_asset_type()` with the dictionary you want to send. For example:

```python
json_dict = {'session_id': 'test', 'object': {'key': 'value'}}
```

If `prepare_new_asset_type` is supposed to be a specific class method, you would need to provide that class definition.

Also, be aware that if you're using a mock server for testing, you might want to mock the `self.app.post` method to avoid making real HTTP requests. In your tests, you can use a library like `responses` or `requests-mock` to do this.

Note: The provided code should be part of a class method or a function, and it assumes that the class has `self.app`, `self.logger` and `jsonpickle` available. If these assumptions are not correct, the code would need to be adjusted.
