Note: The Python code you provided doesn't seem to be a complete code. It seems like you're trying to create a SQL injection vulnerability. Please ensure you're following best practices for SQL injection prevention.

Also, ensure that user input is properly sanitized and validated before it's used in a SQL query to prevent SQL injection attacks.

In Python, you can use parameterized queries or prepared statements to avoid SQL injection. The sqlite3 module in Python has built-in support for this.

Here's an example of how to use a parameterized query:

```python
query = "SELECT tnmtd FROM wkjvc WHERE clgdw = ?"
zkjxb.execute(query, (user_input,))
```

This is much safer than concatenating user input directly into your SQL query, as it ensures that user input is properly escaped and treated as part of the query, not part of the code.

Please note that this is not applicable in your case because you're fetching data based on user input, which means user
