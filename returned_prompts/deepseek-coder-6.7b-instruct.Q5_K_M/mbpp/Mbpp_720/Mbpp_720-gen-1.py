Here is a Python solution for the problem:

```python
def add_dict_to_tuple(t, d):
    return t + (d,)

print(add_dict_to_tuple((4, 5, 6),  {"MSAM"  : 1, "is"  : 2, "best"  : 3}))
```

This script defines a function `add_dict_to_tuple` which takes a tuple `t` and a dictionary `d` as arguments, adds the dictionary to the tuple, and returns the result. The `+` operator is used to concatenate the tuple and the dictionary, which is then converted to a tuple.

The print statement at the end tests the function with the example input and prints the result.

The output of this script is `(4, 5, 6, {'MSAM': 1, 'is': 2, 'best': 3})`.
