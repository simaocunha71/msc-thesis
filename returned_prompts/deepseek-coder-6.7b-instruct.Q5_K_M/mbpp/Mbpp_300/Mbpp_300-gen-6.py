This problem can be solved using the principle of dynamic programming.

The idea is to keep track of the number of binary sequences of length `n` that have a sum of `k` leading ones. For each possible value of `k`, we can either add a leading one or a leading zero to the sequences of length `n - 1` with `k - 1` or `k` leading ones respectively.

Here is a Python solution:

```python
def count_binary_seq(n):
    # Initialize a 2D array to store the counts
    dp = [[0 for _ in range(2*n+1)] for _ in range(n+1)]
    
    # Base case: there is only one way to get sum 0 with 0 leading ones
    dp[0][0] = 1
    
    # Fill in the DP table
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        for j in range(i, 2*n+1):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i][j-1]
            if j > i:
                dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j-1]
                
    # The total count of binary sequences is the sum of counts for all possible sums
    total_count = sum(dp[n])
    
    # The count of binary sequences where the sum of first n bits is the same as the sum of last n bits is the sum of counts for sums equal to n
    same_sum_count = dp[n][n]
    
    # The count of binary sequences where the sum of first n bits is less than the sum of last n bits is the sum of counts for sums less than n
    less_sum_count = sum(dp[n][:n])
    
    # The count of binary sequences where the sum of first n bits is greater than the sum of last n bits is the sum of counts for sums greater than n
    greater_sum_count = total_count - same_sum_count - less_sum_count
    
    # The total count of binary sequences where the sum of first n bits is the same as the sum of last n bits is the sum
