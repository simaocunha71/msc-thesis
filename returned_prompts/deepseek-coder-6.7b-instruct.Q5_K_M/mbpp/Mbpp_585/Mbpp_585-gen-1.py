I see, I misunderstood your question. If you want to find the n most expensive items, even if there are multiple items with the same highest price, you can modify the function like this:

```python
def expensive_items(items, n):

    max_price = items[0]['price']
    most_expensive_items = [item for item in items if item['price'] == max_price]
    return most_expensive_items[:n]
```

This code first sorts the
