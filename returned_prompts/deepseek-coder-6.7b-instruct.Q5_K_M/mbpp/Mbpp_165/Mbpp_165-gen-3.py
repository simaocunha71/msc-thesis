"""
Solution Explanation:
The function "count_char_position" takes a string "s" as input and returns the sum of 1 for each index "i" that is less than the minimum of the length of the string "s" and 26 (the number of English alphabets).
The condition chr(65 + i) == s[i].upper() checks if the character at the position "i" in the string "s" is the same as the character at the position "i" in the English alphabet (converted to uppercase).
If it is, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns 0.
The function then returns the total sum of these 1s, which is the count of characters in the string that occur at the same position in the string as in the English alphabet.
