Here is the Python function for the problem:

```python
def index_multiplication(tuples):
    t1, t2 = tuples
    return tuple(tuple(a*b for a, b in zip(x, y)) for x, y in zip(t1, t2))
```

You can call the function with your tuples as follows:

```python
print(index_multiplication(((1, 3), (4, 5), (2, 9), (1, 10)),((6, 7), (3, 9), (1, 1), (7, 3))))
```

This function works by iterating over the tuples in parallel using the `zip` function. For each pair of tuples, it iterates again using `zip` to multiply the corresponding elements together. It does this in a nested tuple comprehension to build the final result.

The assertion `assert index_multiplication(((1, 3),  (4, 5),  (2, 9),  (1, 10))) == ((6, 21), (12, 45), (2, 9), (7, 30))` should pass if the function is implemented correctly.

Note: This function assumes that both tuples have the same length and that the sub-tuples (those inside the larger tuples) have the same length as well. It will not work correctly if this is not the case.

Please replace `((6, 7), (3, 9), (1, 1), (7, 3))` with your second tuple in the function call.

I hope this helps you solve your problem. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask.
