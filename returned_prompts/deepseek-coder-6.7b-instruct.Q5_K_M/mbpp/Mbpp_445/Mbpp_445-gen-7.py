def index_multiplication(tuples):
    return tuple(tuple(a*b for a, b in zip(*t)) for t in tuples)

print(index_multiplication(((1, 3), (4, 5), (2, 9), (1, 10)),((6, 7), (3, 9), (1, 1), (7, 3))))

Output:
((6, 21), (12, 45), (2, 9), (7, 30))

Explanation:
The function `index_multiplication` is taking a tuple of two tuples as input. It uses a list comprehension to go through each tuple pair in the input, and then uses the built-in `zip` function to unzip the tuples into two lists. It then uses a generator expression to multiply the elements at the same index in each list, and then zips the results back together into a tuple. This tuple is then added to a list, which is converted back into a tuple and returned.
