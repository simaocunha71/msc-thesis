This function splits the sentence into words and checks each word to see if it is an adverb. If it is, it returns the position of the word in the sentence (0-indexed) and the word itself.  The 'adverbs' list is quite small, and this solution will work for any sentence as long as it contains at least one adverb.  For a more robust solution, you would want to use a comprehensive list of adverbs, or a library that can identify and categorize parts of speech in text.  This might involve using a Natural Language Processing library, which is beyond the scope of this question.
