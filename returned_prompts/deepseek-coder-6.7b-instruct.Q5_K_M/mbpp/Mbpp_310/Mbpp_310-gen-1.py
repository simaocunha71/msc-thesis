"""
Answer:

The function string_to_tuple is defined to convert a string to a tuple of characters. This is done by using the built-in tuple() function on the string. The string is passed as an argument to the tuple() function which returns a tuple of the string characters.

Then, the function is called with the string "python 3.0" as an argument and the result is printed to the console. The output is a tuple of characters in the string.
