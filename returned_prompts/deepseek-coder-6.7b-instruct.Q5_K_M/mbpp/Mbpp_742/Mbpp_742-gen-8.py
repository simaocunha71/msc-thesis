"""
First, we need to understand that the area of a tetrahedron is given by the formula:
Area = âˆš3 * side^2, where side is the length of one of the edges of the tetrahedron. 

Here's the Python function for it:

```python
import math

def area_tetrahedron(side):
    return math.sqrt(3) * pow(side, 2)
```

This function takes in the length of one edge of the tetrahedron and returns the area of the tetrahedron. We use the `math.sqrt` function to get the square root and the `pow` function to square the side length.
