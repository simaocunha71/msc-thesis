"""
The formula to calculate the area of a tetrahedron is:

Area = âˆš3 * edge^2

where edge is the length of one edge of the tetrahedron.

We will use the math library in Python to calculate the square root.

"""

The assert statement is used to test the result of the function. If the result is not as expected, the program will throw an AssertionError. In this case, the expected result is 15.588457268119894, which is the area of a tetrahedron with edge length 3.
