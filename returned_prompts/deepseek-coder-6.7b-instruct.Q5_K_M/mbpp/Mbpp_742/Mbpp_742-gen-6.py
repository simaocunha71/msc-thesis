"""
In this code, the function area_tetrahedron(side) takes the length of one side of a tetrahedron as an argument. The formula to calculate the area of a tetrahedron is sqrt(3)*side^2. The math.sqrt(3) function gets the square root of 3 and the ** 2 operator raises side to the power of 2. The result is returned by the function.
