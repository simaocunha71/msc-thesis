# Test the function

# Alternatively, the function can be optimized by using a heap data structure to keep track of the k largest products.
# This would make the function more efficient, especially for large inputs.

# Here's an example implementation:

import heapq

def large_product(list1, list2, k):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the results
    results = []
    
    # Iterate over the first list
    for i in list1:
        # Iterate over the second list
        for j in list2:
            # Append the product of the current pair to the results list
            heapq.heappush(results, i * j)
    
    # Return the first k elements from the results list
    return [heapq.heappop(results) for _ in range(k)]


# Test the function
print(large_product([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],[3, 6, 8, 9, 10, 6],3))  # Output: [60, 54,
