Here is the Python function:

```python
def maximize_elements(t1, t2):
    return tuple(max(a, b) for a, b in zip(t1, t2))
```

This function uses the built-in `zip` function to iterate over the two tuples in parallel. For each pair of elements `a` and `b`, it uses the `max` function to select the maximum of the two elements. The result is a new tuple where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements in the input tuples.
"""
assert maximize_elements(((1, 3), (4, 5), (2, 9), (1, 10)), ((6, 7), (3, 9), (1, 1), (7, 3))) == ((6, 7), (4, 9), (2, 9), (7, 10))
"""
The `assert` statement checks if the output of the function is equal to the expected result. If they are equal, the program continues to run normally. If they are not equal, the program raises an `AssertionError`.
"""

# Expected output:
# ((6, 7), (4, 9), (2, 9), (7, 10))
```
"""

# Solution 2:
# Using NumPy's maximum function:

```python
import numpy as np

def maximize_elements(t1, t2):
    return tuple(np.maximum(t1, t2))

# Testing the function:
print(maximize_elements(((1, 3), (4, 5), (2, 9), (1, 10)), ((6, 7), (3, 9), (1, 1), (7, 3))))

# Expected output:
# ((6, 7), (4, 9), (2, 9), (7, 10))
```

This solution uses NumPy's `maximum` function, which returns the element-wise maximum of two arrays. The function takes the tuples, converts them to NumPy arrays, applies the `maximum` function, and converts the
