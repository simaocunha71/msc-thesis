Explanation:
In this function, we use the Bell triangle to find the number of ways to partition a set of Bell numbers. The Bell triangle is a triangular array of numbers first introduced by Christian G. D. de Moivre in 1964. Each row of the triangle starts with the Bell number, and each successive number is the sum of the previous numbers in the row. The first number of each row is the Bell number of the row number minus one.

The function takes an integer n as input and returns the number of ways to partition a set of Bell numbers. It first initializes a 2D list Bell with zeros. The first row and first column are set to 1. Then, for each number from 1 to n, the function calculates the next row of the Bell triangle by summing the previous row and the current row. The function finally returns the first number of the nth row of the Bell triangle.
