Explanation:
The Bell numbers are a sequence of numbers that appear in the coefficients of the generating function for the Bell numbers, B(n), also known as the Bell Triangle. The Bell Triangle is a triangle of numbers that are defined by the recurrence relation:
B(n+1) = sum(B(i)*B(n-i) for i in range(n+1))
The base case is B(0) = 1.
For example, the Bell Triangle for n=2 is:
1 
2 2 
5 7 10 
15 20 27 50

**Answer:**The number of ways to partition a set of Bell numbers is given by the Bell number itself. So, for the Bell number of 2 (B(2)), there are 2 ways to partition it: {1, 1} and {2}. Therefore, the function `bell_number(2)` returns 2. **Note:** This is a very specific problem and the solution may not be generalized to other cases.  **Question 2**
