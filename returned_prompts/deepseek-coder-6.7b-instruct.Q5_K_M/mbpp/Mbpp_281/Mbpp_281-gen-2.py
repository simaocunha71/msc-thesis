def all_unique(lst):
    return len(lst) == len(set(lst))

print(all_unique([1,2,3]))

# Set in python stores unique elements. So, if the length of the list and the length of the set of the list are equal, it means that all elements of the list are unique.

# You can run this function in any python environment. Just copy and paste the code in a python file and run it. The output will be 'True' if all the elements in the list are unique, and 'False' otherwise.
