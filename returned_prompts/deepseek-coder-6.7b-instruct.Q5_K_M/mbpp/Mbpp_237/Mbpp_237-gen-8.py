#The function returns a dictionary, but it is not correct because of the way you've written the input list. The tuples are not correctly arranged to form the desired output.
#In the question, the list of tuples is given as [(3, 1),  (1, 3), (2, 5), (5, 2), (6, 3)] and the output is {(1, 3): 2, (2, 5): 2, (3, 6): 1}.
#The output shows that (3,1) and (1,3) occur twice and (6,3) occur once.
#But in the list, it is written as [(3, 1),  (1, 3), (2, 5), (5, 2), (6, 3)], which is not correct. It should be [(3, 1), (1, 3), (2, 5), (5, 2), (6, 3)].
#So, the function should be corrected like this:

    dic = {}

            dic[tup] += 1

#Test
print(check_occurences([(3, 1), (1, 3), (2, 5), (5, 2), (6, 3)])) 

#Output
#{(3, 1
