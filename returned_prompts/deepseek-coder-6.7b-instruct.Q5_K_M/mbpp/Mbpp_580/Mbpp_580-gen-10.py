"""
In the function extract_even, we first define a helper function is_even which checks if a number is even. Then we define a recursive function process_tuple to process the input tuple. For each item in the tuple, if the item is a tuple, we process it recursively. If the item is an even number, we add it to the result list. Finally, we return the result as a tuple.

The function extract_even returns the result by calling the process_tuple function with the input tuple.

This approach uses a single function extract_even which checks the type of each element in the tuple. If it is a tuple, it recursively processes it. If it is an even
