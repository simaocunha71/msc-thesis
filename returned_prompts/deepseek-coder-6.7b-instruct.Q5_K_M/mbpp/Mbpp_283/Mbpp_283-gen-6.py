"""
Explanation:
The function `validate` converts the integer to a string and iterates over each character in the string.
For each character, it counts the frequency of that character in the string and checks if the count is greater than the character itself.
If it finds such a case where the count is greater than the character itself, it immediately returns `False`. If it doesn't find any such case, it returns `True` after all the characters have been processed.
