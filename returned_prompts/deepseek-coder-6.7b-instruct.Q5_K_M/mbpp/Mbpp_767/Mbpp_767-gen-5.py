Explanation:
Here we are using two nested loops to iterate over the list of numbers. If the sum of two numbers is equal to the given sum, we increment our count. At the end of the function, we return the count. 
This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) which is quite high for large lists. For large inputs, there is a better way to solve this problem with a time complexity of O(n). We can use a hash map to store the count of each number in the list and then for each number, we check if there is another number that would make the sum equal to the given sum.

Here is the improved solution:

def get_pairs_count(arr, sum):
    hashmap = {}
    count = 0
    for num in arr:
        if (sum - num) in hashmap:
            count += hashmap[sum - num]
        if num in hashmap:
            hashmap[num] += 1
        else:
            hashmap[num] = 1
    return count

print(get_pairs_count([1, 1, 1, 1], 2))

# Output: 6

Explanation:
In this improved solution, we are using a hash map to store the count of each number in the array. For each number in the array, we check if there is another number that would make the sum equal to the given sum. If there is, we increment our count and the count of the number in the hash map. At the end of the function, we return the count. This solution has a time complexity of O(n) which is much better for large inputs.
