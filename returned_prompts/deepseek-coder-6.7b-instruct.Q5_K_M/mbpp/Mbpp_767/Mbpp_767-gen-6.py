Firstly, sort the given list. Then, initialize two variables, one for counting the pairs and the other for traversing the list. 
Next, use a while loop to traverse the list. In the loop, firstly, check if the sum of the current pair is equal to the given sum. If true, count it and increment the counter. 
If not, check if the sum is less than the given sum. If true, increment the start index, else decrement the end index. Repeat the process until the start index is less than the end index. 
Finally, return the counter.

"""
The function works by iterating through the list from both ends. It compares the sum of the numbers at the two ends and adjusts the end index or start index based on whether the sum is smaller or larger than the desired sum. 
If it finds a pair that sums to the desired sum, it increments the count and moves both the start and end indices. 
This process continues until the start index is no longer less than the end index. At the end, it returns the count of such pairs.

Time Complexity: O(nlogn) for sorting, then O(n) for traversing the list once.
Space Complexity: O(1) for no additional space used.
