Here is the Python solution to the problem:

```python
def toggle_middle_bits(n):
    binary = bin(n)[2:]  # Convert to binary and remove '0b' prefix
    middle_bits = list(binary[1:-1])  # Ignore first and last bit
    for i in range(len(middle_bits)):
        # Toggle bit by flipping 0 to 1 and 1 to 0
        middle_bits[i] = '1' if middle_bits[i] == '0' else '0'
    return int(binary[0] + ''.join(middle_bits) + binary[-1], 2)  # Convert back to decimal

print(toggle_middle_bits(9))  # Output: 15
```

This function works by first converting the integer `n` to binary format, then ignoring the first and last bits (which are always 0). It then flips the bits of the remaining middle bits, and finally converts the binary string back to an integer.

The binary representation of `9` (`1001`) has the middle bits toggled (`000`) to `1001` in binary, which equals `9` in decimal. The binary representation of `15` (`1111`) has all bits except the first and last bits toggled (`1001`) to `1111` in binary, which equals `15` in decimal.

So the function works correctly, returning `15` when given the input `9`.
