"""
The function find_length works by first converting the binary string into a list of characters.
Then it iterates over the list and keeps track of the current count of 0s and 1s.
When it finds a 0, it increases the count of 0s, and when it finds a 1, it increases the count of 1s.
At every step, it updates the maximum difference if the difference between the current counts of 0s and 1s is greater.
Finally, it returns the maximum difference.

This function works by iterating through the binary string from left to right, keeping track of the total number of 0s and 1s encountered.
When it finds a 0, it increments the count of 0s, and when it finds a 1, it increments the count of 1s.
The maximum difference between the counts of 0s and 1s is kept in the variable max_diff.
At every step, if the difference between the current counts of 0s and 1s is greater than max_diff, max_diff is updated.
Finally, the function returns max_diff, which represents the maximum difference between the number of 0s and 1s in any sub-string of the binary string.
