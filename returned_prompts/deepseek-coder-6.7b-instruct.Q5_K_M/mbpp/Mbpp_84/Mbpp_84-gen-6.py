The nth number in the newman-conway sequence is calculated by recursively applying the following rules:
- If n is less than or equal to 0, return "invalid input"
- If n is 1 or 2, return 1
- If n is greater than 2, return sequence(sequence(n - 1)) + sequence(n - sequence(n - 1))

Here is the Python code that implements this:

```python
def sequence(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return "Invalid Input"
    elif n == 1 or n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return sequence(sequence(n - 1)) + sequence(n - sequence(n - 1))
```
This function will return the nth number in the Newman-Conway sequence.

Test:

```python
print(sequence(10))  # Output: 6
```
This code will output '6', which is the 10th number in the Newman-Conway sequence.
