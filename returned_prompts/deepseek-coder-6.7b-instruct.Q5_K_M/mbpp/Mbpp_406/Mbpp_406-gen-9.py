def find_Parity(n):
    return n % 2 != 0

print(find_Parity(12))

# Expected output: False

# This function works by using the modulus operator (%) to determine if the remainder of n divided by 2 is not equal to 0. If the remainder is not equal to 0, this means that n is an odd number, so the function returns True. If the remainder is equal to 0, this means that n is an even number, so the function returns False.


# So, the function find_Parity(12) will return False as 12 is an even number.
