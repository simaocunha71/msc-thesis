"""
Explanation:
The function find_Parity takes a number n as input, and returns True if the number is odd (which is determined by the condition n % 2 != 0), and False otherwise. The "%" operator gives the remainder of the division of n by 2, and "!" is a logical NOT operator. Therefore, n % 2 != 0 is True if n is odd and False if n is even.
