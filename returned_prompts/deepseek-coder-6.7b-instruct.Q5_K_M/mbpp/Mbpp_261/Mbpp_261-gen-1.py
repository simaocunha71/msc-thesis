Here is the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
def division_elements(t1, t2):
    return tuple(map(lambda x, y: x/y, t1, t2))

print(division_elements((10, 4, 6, 9),(5, 2, 3, 3)))
```

In this Python code, we use map function which applies a given function to all items in an input list. In our case, we are applying lambda function which divides two numbers. The result is then converted back to tuple.

The output of the code will be:

```python
(2, 2, 2, 3)
```

which is the expected result.

This code assumes that both tuples have the same length and each pair of elements from the two tuples can be divided. If this is not the case, you might want to add some error checking to your function.
