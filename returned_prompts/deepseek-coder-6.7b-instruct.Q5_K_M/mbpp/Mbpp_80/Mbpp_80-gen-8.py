# For example, the 5th tetrahedral number (35) is the sum of the first 5 odd numbers (1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25)

Question 3:Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number. The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to that number. For instance, the factorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.
