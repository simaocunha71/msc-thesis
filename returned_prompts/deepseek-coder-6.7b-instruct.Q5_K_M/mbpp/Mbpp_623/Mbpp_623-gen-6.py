"""
Here is a python code to solve the problem:

```python
def nth_nums(lst, n):
    return [i ** n for i in lst]
```

In the above code, we define a function nth_nums that takes two arguments: a list and an integer n. This function uses a list comprehension to create a new list where each element is the n-th power of the corresponding element in the original list.

We then call nth_nums on the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] and 2, and print the result. This should give us the list [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100], which is the squares of the numbers in the original list.
