Here is the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
def find_dissimilar(t1, t2):
    d = []
    for i in t1:
        if i not in t2:
            d.append(i)
    for i in t2:
        if i not in t1:
            d.append(i)
    return tuple(d)

print(find_dissimilar((3, 4, 5, 6), (5, 7, 4, 10)))
```

In this Python code, we define a function called `find_dissimilar` that takes two tuples as arguments. Inside the function, we use two for loops to iterate over the elements of the tuples. In the first loop, we check if an element from the first tuple is in the second tuple. If it is not, we add it to a list `d`. In the second loop, we do the same but in the opposite direction. Finally, we return the list `d` as a tuple.

When we run this code with the provided example, it returns `(3, 6, 7, 10)`, which are the dissimilar elements in the given two tuples.
