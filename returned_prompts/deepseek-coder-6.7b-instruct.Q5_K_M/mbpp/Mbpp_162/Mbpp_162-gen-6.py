Here is the Python solution to the problem:

```python
def sum_series(n):
    total = 0
    for i in range(0, n//2+1):
        total += n - 2*i
    return total

print(sum_series(6))  # 12
```

In this function, we are looping from i=0 to n//2 (which means we will loop until we reach half of n). For each iteration, we are adding (n - 2*i) to total and at the end we return total which is the sum of the series.
