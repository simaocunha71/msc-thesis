# The function works by first finding the square root of the start and end numbers and converting them to integers. This is because the square root is the lower bound of the range of perfect squares between start and end. The range of perfect squares will start from the square of this integer.

# The range of perfect squares will end at the square of the integer one more than the square root of the end number. This is because the square of the integer one more than the square root of the end number is the upper bound of the range of perfect squares.

# The function then uses a list comprehension to generate a list of the squares of each integer in the range. This is done by raising each integer to the power of 2 and storing the result in the list.

# The function finally returns the list of perfect squares.

# Note that the function uses the square root of the start and end numbers to find the range of perfect squares. This is because the square root of a number is the value that, when squared, gives you the original number. Therefore, the square root of a number gives you the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of the number. This is used as the lower bound of the range of perfect squares.

# The square root of the end number plus one is used as the upper bound of the range of perfect squares. This is because the square root of a number gives you the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of the number. Therefore, the square root of the end number plus one gives you the smallest integer greater than the square root of the end number, which is the upper bound of the range of perfect squares.
