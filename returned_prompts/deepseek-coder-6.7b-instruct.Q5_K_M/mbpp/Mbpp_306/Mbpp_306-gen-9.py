The function max_sum_increasing_subseq takes as arguments a list of integers, n which is the length of the list, k which is the index of the element to be included in the subsequence, and i which is the index up to which the subsequence should be computed. 
The function will find the maximum sum of increasing subsequences from prefix until the ith index and also including the kth element. It will then return this sum.

"""
Here is a Python solution that uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. The function first initializes an array dp of length n with all values as -1. Then it iterates through the array from the beginning, for each element, it checks all previous elements and if the current element is greater than the previous one, it updates the dp array with the max sum. The function also includes the kth element in the subsequence if it is greater than the previous one and is after i. The function returns the max sum from the dp array.

The given solution doesn't work as expected because it doesn't consider the condition that the subsequence should include the kth element after i. We need to modify the condition to check if the current element is greater than the previous one and it
