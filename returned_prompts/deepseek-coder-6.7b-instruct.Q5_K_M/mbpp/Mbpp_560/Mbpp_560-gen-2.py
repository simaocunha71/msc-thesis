This program works by concatenating the two tuples using the '+' operator and then converting the result to a set to remove duplicates. The resulting set is then converted back to a tuple and sorted using the 'sorted' function.

The assertion checks that the output of the function is as expected. If the function is correct, this line of code will run without producing any error message.
