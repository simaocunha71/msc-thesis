```python
import sys

def tuple_size(t):
    return sys.getsizeof(t)

print(tuple_size(("A", 1, "B", 2, "C", 3)))
```

### Answer:
The function `tuple_size` calculates the size of a given tuple using the `sys.getsizeof` function. This function returns the size in bytes of an object.

When we run this code with the input `("A", 1, "B", 2, "C", 3)`, it will return the size of this tuple in bytes.

The output will be the same as `sys.getsizeof(("A", 1, "B", 2, "C", 3))` because `sys.getsizeof` measures the size of the object in bytes and includes the size of the object's type and its contents.

The size of the tuple includes the size of the elements, the size of the tuple itself, and the size of the reference to the tuple in memory. The size of the elements is calculated recursively, including the sizes of the elements' sub-objects.

Therefore, the assertion `assert tuple_size(("A", 1, "B", 2, "C", 3) ) == sys.getsizeof(("A", 1, "B", 2, "C", 3))` is true.

Please note that the size of a tuple can change depending on the Python interpreter and the Python version, as well as the specific elements in the tuple.
