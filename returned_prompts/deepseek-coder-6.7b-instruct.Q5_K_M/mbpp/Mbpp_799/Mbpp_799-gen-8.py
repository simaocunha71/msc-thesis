"""
First, let's understand what a left rotation does. It means moving the bits of the number to the left. The bit that is lost in this process is appended at the end.

Now, let's create a function that would perform the rotation.

We use Python's bitwise operators here. 

The left_rotate function takes two parameters, num and d.

num is the number to rotate, and d is the number of positions to rotate.

We first create a mask that captures the bits that fall outside the 32 bit boundary.

Then, we perform the rotation by shifting the bits of num to the left by d positions and combine the results with the mask to retain only the necessary bits.
"""

def left_rotate(num, d):
    return ((num << d)|(num >> (32 - d))) & 0xFFFFFFFF

# Test the function
print(hex(left_rotate(16, 2)))  # It should print 0x40
"""
In this case, the binary representation of 16 is 10000. After rotating it 2 positions to the left, we get 1000000 (0x40 in hexadecimal). 

The function works as expected.
"""
"""

# Test the function with assert
assert left_rotate(16, 2) == 64
"""
The result of the function should be 64, which is 0x40 in hexadecimal. Assert is used to test if the result of a function matches the expected output. In this case, it works as expected.
