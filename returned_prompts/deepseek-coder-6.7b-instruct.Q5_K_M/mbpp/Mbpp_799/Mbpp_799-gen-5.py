The idea is to take the number and shift it to the left by d positions, then take the number and shift it to the right by 32-d positions to get the bits that got lost in the left shift.

# 64 is obtained by rotating the binary representation of 16 to the left by 2 positions, adding the bits that got lost in the left shift (which are the last 2 bits in the binary representation of 16), and then converting this result back to decimal.

Problem 2: Maximum Difference between two elements such that larger element appears after the smaller elementGiven an array arr[] of integers, find two numbers with the maximum difference given that the larger number must appear after the smaller number in arr[].
