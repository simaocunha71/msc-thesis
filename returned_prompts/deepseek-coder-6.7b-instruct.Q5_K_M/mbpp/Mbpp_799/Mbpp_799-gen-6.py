Here is the Python function for the problem:

```python
def left_rotate(n, d):
    return (n << d)|(n >> (32 - d))
```

In this function, 'n' is the number and 'd' is the number of rotations. 'n << d' is the left shift operation. 'n >> (32 - d)' is the right shift operation. The '|' is a bitwise operator that performs the OR operation.

Let's test the function:

```python
print(left_rotate(16, 2)) # Expected Output: 64
```

This will return the expected output 64.

The function works by shifting the bits in the number to the left by 'd' places, and then shifting the bits that fell off the left end of the number back onto the right end.

The function also takes care of the circular rotation property of bitwise operations by using the '>>' operator to shift the bits that fell off the left end of the number back onto the right end. The number of bits that are shifted back is determined by the total number of bits in the number (32 in this case) minus the number of bits that are shifted out on the left side.

This function can be used to rotate any 32-bit number left by any number of bits.
