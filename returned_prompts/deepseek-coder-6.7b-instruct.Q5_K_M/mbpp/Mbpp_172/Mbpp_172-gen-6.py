Here is the Python function for the problem:

```python
def count_occurance(s):
    return s.count('std')

print(count_occurance("letstdlenstdporstd"))
```

This function uses the `count` method of Python strings, which counts the number of occurrences of a substring in the given string.

When you run this code, it will print `3` which is the correct answer.
