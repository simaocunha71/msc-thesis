"""
Explanation:

This program takes an array and a number k as an input. It finds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in the array that is formed by repeating the array k times. 

The function works by first initializing the maximum sum as the smallest possible integer. Then it starts a loop that repeats k times. Inside the loop, it computes the sum of contiguous subarrays in the array and updates the maximum sum if the computed sum is greater than the maximum sum. If the computed sum becomes negative, it resets it to 0. After each iteration, the array is rotated to the left by one element. 

The function then returns the maximum sum.

# Time complexity: O(n^2)
# Space complexity: O(1)

# Note: This solution assumes that the array consists of integers.
# If the array contains non-integer values, the function might not work as expected.
# This solution also assumes that the array is not empty.
# If the array is empty, the function will return the smallest possible integer as the maximum sum.
