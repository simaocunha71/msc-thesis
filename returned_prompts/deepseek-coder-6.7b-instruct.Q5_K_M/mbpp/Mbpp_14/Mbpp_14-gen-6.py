def find_Volume(base,height,length):
    # formula to find volume of triangular prism is (base*height*length)/2
    return (base*height*length)//2

# Testing the function
print(find_Volume(10,8,6)) # Output: 240

# This is a simple Python program to find the volume of a triangular prism.
# The formula to find the volume of triangular prism is: (base * height * length) / 2.
# So we are just multiplying base, height and length and then dividing by 2.

# The function 'find_Volume' takes three parameters: base, height and length.
# It returns the volume of the triangular prism.

# In the test case, the base is 10, height is 8, length is 6. The function returns 240 as expected.
