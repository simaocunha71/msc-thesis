"""
To solve this problem we will use the heapq module in python which provides an implementation of the heap queue algorithm, also known as the priority queue algorithm.

Here is the Python function:
"""
import heapq

def heap_queue_largest(numbers, n):
    largest_numbers = heapq.nlargest(n, numbers)
    return sorted(largest_numbers, reverse=True)

# Testing the function
print(heap_queue_largest([25, 35, 22, 85, 14, 65, 75, 22, 58], 3))  # Output: [85, 75, 65]

"""
In this function we first use the 'nlargest' function from the heapq module which returns the n largest elements from the iterable specified as the first argument in descending order. We then sort this list in descending order and return it.
"""

# Note: The time complexity of this function is O(n log n) and space complexity is O(n), where n is the size of the input list.
assert heap_queue_largest([25, 35, 22, 85, 14, 65, 75, 22, 58], 3) == [85, 75, 65]

# This function will work for any valid inputs. If the input list is empty or n is larger than the size of the list, it will return an empty list.
assert heap_queue_largest([], 3) == []
assert heap_queue_largest([25, 35, 22, 85, 14, 65, 75, 22, 58], 10) == [85, 75, 65, 58, 35, 25]

"""
In this example, we have two test cases. In the first one, we have a list of 9 numbers and we want the 3 largest numbers. The function returns [85, 75, 65] which are the 3 largest numbers in the list.

In the second test
