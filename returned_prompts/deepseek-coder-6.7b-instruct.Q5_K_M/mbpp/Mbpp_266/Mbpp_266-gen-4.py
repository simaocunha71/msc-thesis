#Output: 100

"""
Explanation:
The lateral surface area of a cube is given by 4*side^2. Here, we are passing the side_length as a parameter to the function and returning the calculated lateral surface area.
"""

# 2. Write a Python function to find the total surface area of a cube given its side length.
