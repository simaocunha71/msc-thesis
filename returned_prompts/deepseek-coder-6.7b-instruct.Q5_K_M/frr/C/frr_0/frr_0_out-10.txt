Creating a full-fledged network intrusion detection system, including machine learning algorithms, is a complex task. It requires a deep understanding of the network protocol stack, machine learning concepts, and programming languages like Python, C, etc. Moreover, it's not feasible to cover all the required code in a single answer. 

However, I can provide a high-level overview of how such a system can be implemented in C. For the sake of simplicity, let's assume that we're using a basic heuristic-based system for detecting malicious traffic.

```c
#include <pcap.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

#define MAX_PACKET_SIZE 65536

struct rule {
    char *ip;
    int port;
    bool isMalicious;
};

struct rule rules[100]; // Assume a maximum of 100 rules
int ruleCount = 0;

bool isMaliciousPacket(char *ip, int port) {
    for (int i = 0; i < ruleCount; ++i) {
        if (strcmp(rules[i].ip, ip) == 0 && rules[i].port == port) {
            return rules[i].isMalicious;
        }
    }

    // No rule found, assume it's not malicious
    return false;
}

void packetHandler(u_char *args, const struct pcap_pkthdr *header, const u_char *packet) {
    struct iphdr *iph = (struct iphdr*) (packet + sizeof(struct ethhdr));
    struct tcphdr *tcph = (struct tcphdr*) (packet + sizeof(struct ethhdr) + sizeof(struct iphdr));

    char *srcIP = inet_ntoa(iph->saddr);
    int srcPort = ntohs(tcph->source);

    if (isMaliciousPacket(srcIP, srcPort)) {
        // Block the packet
    }
}

int main() {
    char errbuf[PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE];
    pcap_t *handle =
