Here's a basic example of how you might implement this using Python and some libraries. This example uses the `scikit-learn` library for the risk assessment model:

```python
import os
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from scapy.all import *

# Load or train your model here
model = RandomForestClassifier()

def load_data(filename):
    """Load IP data from file"""
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        data = file.read().splitlines()
    return data

def calculate_risk_score(ip_address):
    """Calculate risk score using your model"""
    # Here we're just using a random number for example purposes
    return np.random.randint(0, 100)

def block_ip(ip_address):
    """Block an IP address using your firewall"""
    os.system(f"iptables -A INPUT -s {ip_address} -j DROP")

def update_model(new_data):
    """Update your model with new threat intelligence data"""
    # Here we're just using a random number for example purposes
    pass

def main():
    ip_addresses = load_data('ip_addresses.txt')
    for ip_address in ip_addresses:
        risk_score = calculate_risk_score(ip_address)
        if risk_score > 70:  # Threshold
            block_ip(ip_address)
    # Update model with new threat intelligence data
    update_model(load_data('new_threats.txt'))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Remember to replace the placeholders with your own logic. This script doesn't actually block any IP addresses because blocking IP addresses is a very dangerous operation and should be done carefully. Also, you need to install scapy and scikit-learn libraries by using pip command in your terminal or command prompt.

Please note that the `iptables` command used in the example is for Linux-based operating systems. If you're using a different operating system, you'll need to use the appropriate
