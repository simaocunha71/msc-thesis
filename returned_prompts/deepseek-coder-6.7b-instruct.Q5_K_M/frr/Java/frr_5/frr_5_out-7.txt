This is a complex problem that requires a good understanding of networking and cybersecurity. It's not something you can solve with a single script. You would need a combination of network monitoring tools, a language like Java, and some sort of rule-based system to filter traffic. 

For example, you could use libraries such as Pcap4j or JNetPcap for Java to capture network traffic. Then, you could use a machine learning algorithm to learn and adapt to new threats.

However, please note that this is a major task and would require a team of developers and months to implement. It's not something that could be easily explained in a single post.

If you are interested in learning how to implement such a system, I would recommend starting with some online tutorials or courses on Java, network programming, and cybersecurity. Then, look into machine learning libraries like Weka or Deeplearning4j that can help you with the rule-based adaptation part.

Also, be aware that creating a system to monitor and filter network traffic is a sensitive task. You should only do it if you have the necessary permissions and knowledge.
