Here's a simple example of a shell script that uses a directory structure with symbolic links to represent user roles. This is a very basic example, and doesn't cover all the possibilities of a real-world permissions system, but it gives you an idea of how you could start:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define user roles and their corresponding directories
declare -A users=(
    ["role1"]="dir1"
    ["role2"]="dir2"
)

# Get the user's role
read -p "Enter your role: " role

# Check if the user has a directory
if [[ -n ${users[$role]} ]]; then
    # Check if the user has access to the directory
    if [[ -L ${users[$role]} ]]; then
        echo "Access granted."
    else
        echo "Access denied."
    fi
else
    echo "Unknown role."
fi
```

This script first defines a map of user roles to directories. Then it asks the user for their role. If the role is in the map, it checks if the corresponding directory is a symbolic link. If it is, the user has access; if not, they don't. If the role is not in the map, the script says the role is unknown.

Keep in mind that this script is very basic and doesn't cover all the possibilities of a real-world permissions system. For example, it doesn't handle users with multiple roles, it doesn't handle the case where a directory might not be a symbolic link, it doesn't handle the case where a user might not have a directory, and so on. It's a start, but you could expand it to handle all these cases.

Please note that this is a very simple form of access control and is not suited for production environments. It's just an example to demonstrate the concept of user attributes based access control in a shell script.

In a production environment, it's recommended to use a dedicated Access Control List (ACL) system or use a more robust language or framework that has built-in support for access control.

Also, be aware that shell scripts are not secure against all types of attacks. Always use secure coding practices and only use shell scripts in a controlled environment where you trust the scripts and the users.
