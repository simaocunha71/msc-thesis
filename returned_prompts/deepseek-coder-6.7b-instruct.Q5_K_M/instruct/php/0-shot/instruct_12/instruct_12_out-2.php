This class defines a set of properties for a web application's assets. The `basePath` and `baseUrl` properties define the base path and URL for the asset files. The `css` property is an array of CSS files, and the `js` property is an array of JavaScript files. The `depends` property is an array of the names of other asset bundles that this bundle depends on.

In this case, the `AppAsset` class is dependent on the `YiiAsset`, `BootstrapAsset`, and `BootstrapPluginAsset` bundles, which are included in the Yii framework.

## Q3:

```php
<?php

/*
    Write a PHP class that defines a set of public properties for a web application's assets, including a base path, base URL, CSS files, JavaScript files, and dependencies on other assets.
    The class should use the Yii framework's BootstrapAsset and BootstrapPluginAsset.

    Only return the code, don't include any other information,
    such as a preamble or suffix.
