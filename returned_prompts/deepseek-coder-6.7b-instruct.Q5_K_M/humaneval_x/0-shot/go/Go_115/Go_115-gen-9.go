## Explanation

This problem can be solved by iterating over the grid and count the total amount of water in the wells. Then calculate the number of times the bucket needs to be lowered to empty all the wells by dividing the total amount of water by the bucket capacity. 

However, this calculation may not be accurate, because the bucket may not be completely full after lowering it a certain number of times. To account for this, iterate over the grid again, adding up the water in each row of the grid. If the total water in a row is greater than or equal to the number of times the bucket needs to be lowered, return that number of times. This ensures that the bucket is completely empty before moving on to the next row.

This solution assumes that the bucket can be emptied from the wells in any order. If the order matters, a different algorithm would be needed.

## Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n*m), where n is the number of rows in the grid and m is the number of columns in the grid. This is because we are iterating over each cell in the grid once. The space complexity is O(1), because we are only using a constant amount of extra space to store the total amount of water and the number of times the bucket needs to be lowered.
