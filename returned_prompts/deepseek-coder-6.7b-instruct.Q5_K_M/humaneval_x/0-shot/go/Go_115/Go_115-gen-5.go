This problem is about simulation and greedy algorithms.
You are given a grid of wells and each well can have either 0 or 1 water unit in it. Your task is to empty all the wells by using the bucket which has a capacity of given number. 

To solve this problem, you need to check all the wells one by one and try to fill the bucket with water from the wells. You can either fill the bucket to its full capacity or to the number of water units in the well, whichever is smaller. Then decrease the bucket by the amount of water you just filled. Repeat this process until all the wells are empty. 

Here is a simple pseudo-code to solve this problem:

1. Initialize a variable count to 0 to keep track of the number of times you need to lower the bucket.
2. For each row in the grid:
   For each well in the row:
     If the well has water:
       Calculate the amount of water you can fill the bucket with, which is the minimum between the bucket capacity and the number of water units in the well.
       Subtract this amount from the number of water units in the well.
       Add this amount to the count.
3. Return the count.

This pseudo-code assumes that the grid is a 2D array where 0 represents an empty well and 1 represents a well with water. The bucket capacity is given as an integer. The function should return the minimum number of times you need to lower the bucket to empty all the wells.
