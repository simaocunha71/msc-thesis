This program does not return the count of the digit 7 in numbers that are divisible by 11 or 13 within the range of n. Instead, it returns the count of the digit 7 in the first such number it finds.

If you want to count the total number of times the digit 7 appears in all such numbers, you need to change your approach. Instead of returning immediately after finding the first number, you need to add the count of 7 in that number to a total count and continue until you've checked all numbers.

Here is the corrected code:

```go
func FizzBuzz(n int) int {
	total := 0
	for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
		if i % 11 == 0 || i % 13 == 0 {
			total += strings.Count(strconv.Itoa(i), "7")
		}
	}
	return total
}
```

This code will return the total number of times the digit 7 appears in all numbers less than n that are divisible by 11 or 13.

For example, FizzBuzz(79) will return 4, because the numbers 70, 74, 77, and 79 are less than 79 and divisible by 11 or 13, and there are 4 instances of the digit 7 in these numbers.
*/

func main() {
	fmt.Println(FizzBuzz(78)) // 2
	fmt.Println(FizzBuzz(79)) // 3
	fmt.Println(FizzBuzz(50)) // 0
}
