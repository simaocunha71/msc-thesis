You are returning the count of '7' from the first number that meets the criteria, but according to the problem statement, you need to count the occurrences in numbers less than n that meet the criteria.

Here is a revised version of your function:

```go
func FizzBuzz(n int) int {
    count := 0
    for i := 11; i < n; i++ {
        if i%11 == 0 || i%13 == 0 {
            strI := strconv.Itoa(i)
            count += strings.Count(strI, "7")
        }
    }
    return count
}
```
This function counts the occurrences of '7' in numbers less than n that are divisible by 11 or 13.

You can test this function with the following code:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println(FizzBuzz(50))  // Output: 0
    fmt.Println(FizzBuzz(78))  // Output: 2
    fmt.Println(FizzBuzz(79))  // Output: 3
}
```

This will print the count of the digit '7' in numbers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.

Please note that the time complexity of this function is O(n), which means it may take a long time to run if n is a large number.

```go
