	for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
		if i%11 == 0 || i%13 == 0 {
			s := strconv.Itoa(i)
			count := strings.Count(s, "7")
			return count
		}
	}
	return 0
}

The problem with your original code is that it only checks numbers less than `n` that are divisible by 11 or 13, and then counts the number of times the digit 7 appears in those numbers. 

You're returning the count as soon as it is found, which means you're only checking the first number that meets these conditions. You should accumulate the count instead of returning it. 

Also, if you want to count the number of times 7 appears in all numbers less than `n` that are divisible by 11 or 13, you should move the return statement outside of the loop.

Here's the corrected code:

```go
import (
	"strconv"
	"strings"
)

func FizzBuzz(n int) int {
	count := 0
	for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
		if i%11 == 0 || i%13 == 0 {
			s := strconv.Itoa(i)
			count += strings.Count(s, "7")
		}
	}
	return count
}
```

This function will return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than `n` which are divisible by 11 or 13.
