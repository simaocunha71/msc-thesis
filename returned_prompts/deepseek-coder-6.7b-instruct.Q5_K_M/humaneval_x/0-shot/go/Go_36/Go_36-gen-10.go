	for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
		if i%11 == 0 || i%13 == 0 {
			return strings.Count(strconv.Itoa(i), "7")
		}
	}
	return 0
}

// The above code does not work as expected. Please correct it.



Corrected Code:


```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strconv"
	"strings"
)

// Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.
// 
func FizzBuzz(n int) int {
	count := 0
	for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
		if i%11 == 0 || i%13 == 0 {
			count += strings.Count(strconv.Itoa(i), "7")
		}
	}
	return count
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(FizzBuzz(50))  // Outputs: 0
	fmt.Println(FizzBuzz(78))  // Outputs: 2
	fmt.Println(FizzBuzz(79))  // Outputs: 3
}
```



In the incorrect code, the return statement was inside the loop which caused it to return the count immediately after the first iteration. Moving the return statement outside of the loop fixed this issue. The corrected code also needs to keep a running count of the number of times the digit 7 appears, so a count variable was added to keep track of this.
