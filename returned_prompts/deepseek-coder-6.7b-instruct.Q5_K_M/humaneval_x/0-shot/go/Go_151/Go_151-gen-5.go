    var sum int
    for _, num := range lst {
        if num < 0 || num != float64(int(num)) {
            continue
        }
        if int(num) % 2 == 1 {
            sum += int(math.Pow(num, 2))
        }
    }
    return sum
}

This is a correct implementation. The function DoubleTheDifference iterates over the provided list of numbers. If the number is negative or is not an integer, it skips the current iteration. If the number is odd, it squares the number and adds the result to sum. In the end, it returns sum as an integer.

Note:

math.Mod(num, 1) != 0

The above statement checks if the number is not an integer. If the number is an integer, math.Mod(num, 1) will return 0. Therefore, the above statement will return true only for non-integer numbers.

int(math.Pow(num, 2))

The above statement squares the number and returns the result as an integer.

int(num) % 2 == 1

The above statement checks if the number is odd. If the number is odd, the remainder of the division by 2 is 1, so the above statement will return true.

In conclusion, the correct implementation is as described above.
