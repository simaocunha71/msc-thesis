    for a != 0 {
        if a % 10 == 0 {
            return 0
        }
        a = a / 10
    }

    return (a % 10) * (b % 10)
}

It seems like you've just swapped the for loops and the return statement in your code. The loop checks for 0s in the units place and returns 0 if it encounters one, so it's a good check for the product to be 0. If no zeros are found, the function then calculates the product of the unit digits of the two numbers and returns that value.

A: I think the logic of your code is a bit confusing. You seem to be trying to get the last digit of the numbers with the modulus operator (% 10), then you are dividing the original numbers to remove the last digit. However, this operation could result in negative numbers which could cause issues in your loops. 

Here is a correct version of your function:

```go
func Multiply(a, b int) int {
    if math.Abs(float64(a%10)) == 0 || math.Abs(float64(b%10)) == 0 {
        return 0
    }

    return (a % 10) * (b % 10)
}
```

In this version, I used the math.Abs function to ensure that the modulus operation always returns a positive result. This should solve the problem of negative numbers in your original code.

Also, your function checks for zero in the unit place of the two numbers with the condition (a % 10 == 0 || b % 10 == 0), and returns 0 if any of them is zero.

I hope this helps
