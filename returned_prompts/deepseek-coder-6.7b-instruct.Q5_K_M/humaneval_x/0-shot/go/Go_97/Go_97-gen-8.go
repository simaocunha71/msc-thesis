    a = int(math.Abs(float64(a % 10)))
    b = int(math.Abs(float64(b % 10)))
    return a * b

}

In this code, the function Multiply takes in two integers, a and b, and returns the product of the last digits of a and b. The last digits are found by using the modulus operator %. The modulus operator returns the remainder of a division operation.

The first line of the function calculates the unit digit of a by getting the remainder of a divided by 10, and then takes the absolute value of the result to ensure it's a positive number. The same process is applied to b.

Finally, the function returns the product of the two unit digits.

The function uses the math package to handle the absolute value function.

The code block after the function definition is unnecessary and can be removed.

In the problem statement, it mentioned "Assume the input is always valid", which means the function can be used without any error checking for the input.

In the examples provided, the function works as expected. For example, Multiply(148, 412) returns 16 (because 8 * 2 = 16), and Multiply(19, 28) returns 72 (because 9 * 2 = 72).

Please note that this function will not work correctly if the input includes negative numbers because the absolute value function is used. For example, Multiply(14,-15) will return 20 (because 4 * 5 = 20), not -20 as you would expect.

I hope this helps clarify the problem. Let me know if you have any further questions.
