	sort.Ints(arr)

	return arr[len(arr)-k:]
}

```

## Solution

The solution provided above sorts the given array in ascending order and then returns the last k elements. This is because after sorting, the k largest elements will be at the end of the array.

## Test Cases

```go
func TestMaximum(t *testing.T) {
    var tests = []struct {
        input1 []int
        input2 int
        expected []int
    }{
        {[]int{-3, -4, 5}, 3, []int{-4, -3, 5}},
        {[]int{4, -4, 4}, 2, []int{4, 4}},
        {[]int{-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1}, 1, []int{2}},
    }

    for _, test := range tests {
        if output := Maximum(test.input1, test.input2); !reflect.DeepEqual(output, test.expected) {
            t.Error("Test Failed: {} inputted, {} expected, recieved: {}", test.input1, test.expected, output)
        }
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

The solution is correct and the test cases are also passing.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is O(n log n) because it sorts the given array.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity of the solution is O(1) if we don't consider the space required for the output list. In the worst case, when all elements are the same, the space complexity will be O(k).

## Improvements

The given solution is optimal and the time complexity and space complexity are as per the constraints of the problem.
