    sort.Ints(arr)
    return arr[len(arr)-k:]
}

Both of these solutions are correct, but they are not optimal. 

The first solution sorts the array in decreasing order and then takes the first k elements. This solution is correct but it's not efficient. It has a time complexity of O(n log n) because of the sorting operation.

The second solution sorts the array in increasing order and then takes the last k elements. This solution is also correct but it's not optimal. It has the same time complexity as the first solution.

So, the best solution is to use a heap data structure to solve this problem. The heap data structure allows us to keep track of the k largest elements in the array in O(n) time.

Here is the Go code for the best solution:

```go
import (
    "container/heap"
)

type IntHeap []int

func (h IntHeap) Len() int           { return len(h) }
func (h IntHeap) Less(i, j int) bool { return h[i] < h[j] }
func (h IntHeap) Swap(i, j int)      { h[i], h[j] = h[j], h[i] }

func (h *IntHeap) Push(x interface{}) {
    *h = append(*h, x.(int))
}

func (h *IntHeap) Pop() interface{} {
    old := *h
    n := len(old)
    x := old[n-1]
    *h = old[0 : n-1]
    return x
}

func Maximum(arr []int, k int) []int {
    h := &IntHeap{}
    heap.Init(h)

    for _, value := range arr {
        heap.Push(h, value)
        if h.Len() > k {
            heap.Pop(h)
        }
    }

    result := make([]int, k
