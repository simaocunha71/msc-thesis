    sort.Sort(sort.Reverse(sort.IntSlice(arr)))
    return arr[:k]
}


A: 
The above code sorts the array in descending order and then returns the first k elements. This solution works, but it's not efficient. In the worst-case scenario, the sorting function has a time complexity of O(n log n), and slicing a Go slice has a time complexity of O(k). So, the overall time complexity of this solution is O(n log n + k), which can be simplified to O(n log n).

B:
    maxHeap := &MaxHeap{}
    heap.Init(maxHeap)

    for _, num := range arr {
        heap.Push(maxHeap, num)
    }

    result := make([]int, k)
    for i := 0; i < k; i++ {
        result[i] = heap.Pop(maxHeap).(int)
    }

    return result
}


B: 
This solution uses a max heap to keep track of the k largest numbers. The time complexity of this solution is O(n log k), where n is the length of the array. This is because we are pushing every number in the array into the heap, which has a time complexity of O(log k) and we do this n times.
