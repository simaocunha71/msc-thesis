    text = strings.Replace(text, "  ", "__", -1)
    text = strings.Replace(text, " ", "_", -1)
    text = strings.Replace(text, "__", "-", -1)

    return text
}

```

This code will replace all spaces with underscores, and then replace all pairs of underscores with dashes.

The use of `strings.Replace(text, "  ", "__", -1)` is because we first replace all pairs of spaces with double underscores to identify them later. This is done before replacing all single spaces with underscores, because if we replaced all single spaces first, we could end up with triple underscores (because each space is replaced by two underscores).

Finally, `strings.Replace(text, "__", "-", -1)` is used to replace all double underscores with dashes.

The `-1` in `strings.Replace(text, "  ", "__", -1)` indicates that we want to replace all occurrences of the substring, not just the first one.
