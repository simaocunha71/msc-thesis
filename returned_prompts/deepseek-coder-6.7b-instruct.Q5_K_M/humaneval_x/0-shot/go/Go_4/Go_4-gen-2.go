The MeanAbsoluteDeviation function begins by calculating the mean of the input numbers. This is done by summing all the numbers and then dividing by the length of the numbers slice.

B:
The function then calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD). This is done by summing the absolute differences between each number and the mean. This sum is then divided by the length of the numbers slice to get the MAD.

Finally, the function returns the MAD.

Here's a revised version of the function. It's easier to read and less prone to bugs:

```go
import (
	"math"
)

// MeanAbsoluteDeviation returns the Mean Absolute Deviation of a slice of floats.
func MeanAbsoluteDeviation(numbers []float64) float64 {
	sum := 0.0
	for _, num := range numbers {
		sum += num
	}
	mean := sum / float64(len(numbers))

	sum = 0.0
	for _, num := range numbers {
		sum += math.Abs(num - mean)
	}
	mad := sum / float64(len(numbers))

	return mad
}
```

This version of the function does exactly the same thing as the original, but it's easier to understand and less prone to bugs.

Note: This function assumes that the numbers slice is not empty. If you're not sure that the numbers slice is not empty, you should add a check for this before calculating the mean and MAD.
