    sum := 0.0
    for _, number := range numbers {
        sum += math.Abs(number)
    }
    mean := sum / float64(len(numbers))

B:
    diffs := make([]float64, len(numbers))
    for i, number := range numbers {
        diffs[i] = math.Abs(number - mean)
    }

C:
    return Mean(diffs)
}

I understand that this code calculates the mean of the absolute values of the numbers, subtracts it from each number and then calculates the mean of the resulting absolute values.
But I don't understand the following part:
C:
    return Mean(diffs)
}

I'm guessing it's returning the mean of the differences. But why is this necessary?
Isn't the result of the MeanAbsoluteDeviation function just the mean of the absolute values of the original numbers?
If I understand correctly, the MeanAbsoluteDeviation function should just return the mean of the absolute values of the numbers. 
I understand that the MeanAbsoluteDeviation function is a measure of how spread out the numbers are, but why do we need to calculate the mean of the absolute values again? 

A: In statistics, the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) is a measure of variability, just like the standard deviation or variance. It's a measure of how much the values in the data set deviate from the mean (the expected value). 

The Mean Absolute Deviation is calculated by subtracting the mean from each value, taking the absolute value of the result, and then calculating the mean of those absolute values. This is done to remove any negative signs that could skew the results.

The reason we still calculate the mean of the absolute values (i.e., the result of the calculation in C) is because the original calculation gave us the deviation of each value from the mean, but we might still want to know how much the data is deviated from the mean in terms of the magnitude of the original numbers, not just in terms of how far they are from the mean in absolute terms.

So, even though the original calculation gives us the absolute mean deviation, we often want to know how much
