    var sum float64
    mean := Mean(numbers)
    for _, num := range numbers {
        sum += math.Abs(num - mean)
    }
    return sum / float64(len(numbers))
}


This version of the function calculates mean of the data first, then for each number in the dataset, it computes the absolute difference between the number and the mean, and adds these differences to the sum. The mean absolute deviation is then the average of these absolute differences.
