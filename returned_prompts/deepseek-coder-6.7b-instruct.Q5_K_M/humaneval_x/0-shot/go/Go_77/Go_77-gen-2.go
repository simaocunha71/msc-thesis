    if a < 0 {
        a = a * -1
    }

B:
    for i := 0; i <= a; i++ {
        if i*i*i == a {
            return true
        }
    }
    return false
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(Iscube(1))
    fmt.Println(Iscube(2))
    fmt.Println(Iscube(-1))
    fmt.Println(Iscube(64))
    fmt.Println(Iscube(0))
    fmt.Println(Iscube(180))
}

I am trying to understand how this code works, can someone please explain it to me?

A: This function takes an integer as an argument and checks if the given integer is a perfect cube of some integer number. 

In line 1 and 2, it imports the necessary packages, math being the only one used here.

In function Iscube(a int), the input integer is passed as an argument.

In line 4, it checks if the integer is negative. If it is, it changes the sign to positive. This is done because the cube of any number will always be positive, regardless if the original number is positive or negative.

In line 5, it starts a for loop which runs from 0 to the absolute value of the given integer (a). The loop variable i is used to check for the cube of i.

In line 6, it checks if the cube of i (i*i*i) is equal to the given integer (a). If it is, then the given integer is a cube of some integer, so the function returns true.

In line 7, if the given integer is not a cube of any integer from 0 to its absolute value, the function returns false.

Finally, in the main function, it calls the Iscube function with different integers and prints the returned boolean values.

The time complexity of this code is O(n), because in the worst-case scenario (when the input is the maximum possible integer), the function will have to run the loop n times, where n is the absolute value of the input.

The space complexity is O(1),
