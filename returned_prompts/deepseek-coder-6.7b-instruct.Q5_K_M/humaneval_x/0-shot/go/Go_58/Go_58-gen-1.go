The above code is a function in Go programming language that takes two slices of integers as input and returns a slice of common unique integers from both input slices.

It first sorts both slices of integers. Then it uses two pointers (i and j) to iterate over both slices. If the elements at the current positions of both slices are equal, it adds that element to the common slice and moves both pointers forward. If the element in the first slice is smaller than the element in the second slice, it only moves the pointer of the first slice forward. If the element in the second slice is smaller, it only moves the pointer of
