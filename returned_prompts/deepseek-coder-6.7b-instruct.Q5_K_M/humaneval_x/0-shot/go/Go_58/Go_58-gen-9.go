    sort.Ints(l1)
    sort.Ints(l2)

B:
    var commons []int
    for _, v1 := range l1 {
        for _, v2 := range l2 {
            if v1 == v2 {
                commons = append(commons, v1)
            }
        }
    }

C:
    return commons
}

I understand that this code is working as expected. But I have a question about the part of code in A where sort.Ints(l1) and sort.Ints(l2) are used. What is the benefit of sorting these arrays before comparison?

A: Sorting the arrays before comparison makes the code more efficient.

When you are comparing two arrays, the time complexity is O(n*m), where n and m are the sizes of the arrays. This means that if n and m are large, the algorithm will take a long time to finish.

However, if you sort the arrays first, you can compare the elements in a sorted manner. This reduces the number of comparisons. For instance, if the elements in the first array are [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and the elements in the second array are [5, 4, 3, 2, 1], the common elements are [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] in no particular order.

Sorting the arrays before comparison helps to reduce the time complexity to O(n log n + m log m), where n log n and m log m are the time complexities of sorting an array of n and m elements respectively.

So, the benefit of sorting the arrays before comparison is that it makes the code more efficient.

Here is the optimized version of your code using sort.IntSlice:

```go
import (
    "sort"
)

func Common(l1 []int, l2 []int) []int {
    sort.Ints(l1)
    sort.Ints(l2)

    var commons []int
    i, j := 0, 0
    for i < len(l1) && j < len(l2) {
        if l1[i] < l2[j
