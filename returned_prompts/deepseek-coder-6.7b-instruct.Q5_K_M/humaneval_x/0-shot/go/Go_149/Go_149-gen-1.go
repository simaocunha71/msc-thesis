I've been trying to solve this problem for a few hours now and I am still getting incorrect results. Could you please help me understand what I'm doing wrong?

A: Your code is almost correct, but the issue is that you're checking the length of the elements in the slice, not the elements themselves. You need to check the elements themselves instead of their lengths.
Here's the corrected code:
func SortedListSum(lst []string) []string {
    sort.Slice(lst, func(i, j int) bool {
        if len(lst[i])%2 == 0 && len(lst[j])%2 != 0 {
            return true
        }
        if len(lst[i])%2 != 0 && len(lst[j])%2 == 0 {
            return false
        }
        if len(lst[i])%2 == 0 && len(lst[j])%2 == 0 {
            if len(lst[i]) < len(lst[j]) {
                return true
            }
            if len(lst[i]) > len(lst[j]) {
                return false
            }
            return lst[i] < lst[j]
        }
        return false
    })
    return lst
}

In this code, I've added two conditions to check if the length of the string is even or odd. If the length of the string is even, it should come first. If the length of the string is odd, it should come last. If the lengths are the same, I've added a condition to sort them alphabetically.

A: First, we need to clarify the problem. The problem is to sort a list of strings by the length of the string and then by the alphabetical order of the string. The function should return a list of strings with even
