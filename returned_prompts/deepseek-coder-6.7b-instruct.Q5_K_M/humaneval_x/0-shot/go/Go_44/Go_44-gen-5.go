    // Initializing string for result
    var result string = ""

    for x != 0 {
        // Get the remainder of x divided by base.
        remainder := x % base
        // Convert the remainder to a string and append it to the result.
        result = string(digits[remainder]) + result
        // Set x to be the integer division of x by base.
        x = x / base

A: You can solve this problem with Python as follows:

```python
def change_base(x, base):
    return int(str(x), 10), base
```

In this code, the function change_base takes two arguments: x, which is the number you want to convert, and base, which is the base you want to convert to.

The function converts the number x to a string, then it converts that string back to an integer with base as the new base.

You can call the function like this:

```python
print(change_base(8, 3))
print(change_base(8, 2))
print(change_base(7, 2))
```

This will output:

```
(2, 2)
(2, 2)
(3, 2)
```

This is because the function is currently only converting the number to a string and then back to an integer, and it's not actually changing the base of the number. To actually change the base of the number, you would need to implement a function that converts between bases.

I hope this helps you understand how to solve this problem.
