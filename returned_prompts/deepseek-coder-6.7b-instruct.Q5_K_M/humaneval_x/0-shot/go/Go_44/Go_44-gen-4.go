A: Here's a solution using the built-in strconv package:

```go
import (
    "strconv"
)

func ChangeBase(x int, base int) string  {
    // convert x to the new base using strconv.FormatInt
    return strconv.FormatInt(int64(x), base)
}
```

This solution works by using the FormatInt function from the strconv package, which converts an integer to a string representation in the specified base. 

Note: strconv.FormatInt takes an int64 as input, so you may need to convert the int input to an int64 before passing it to the function.

Also, the base parameter must be between 2 and 36, inclusive. If it is outside this range, the function will return a string that does not represent a valid integer in the given base.

Test this function with different inputs to ensure it's working as expected.

```go
func main() {
    fmt.Println(ChangeBase(8, 3))  // Output: 22
    fmt.Println(ChangeBase(8, 2))  // Output: 1000
    fmt.Println(ChangeBase(7, 2))  // Output: 111
}
```

This code will print the base-3, base-2, and base-2 representations of the decimal number 8, 7, and 7 respectively.

```
22
1000
111
```

The function works by converting the input integer to a string in the specified base using the strconv.FormatInt function.

Please note that the base numbers are less than 10. If you pass a base number greater than 10, it will not correctly convert the number to that base.

This function does not handle negative numbers. If you need to handle negative numbers, you will need to add additional logic to handle them correctly.

The function also does not handle base numbers that are not in the range 2 to 36. If you need to handle base numbers outside this range, you will need to add additional logic to handle them correctly.

I hope this helps you understand how to convert a number from
