The recursive function works by continuously dividing the number by the base and appending the remainder to the result. It continues this until the number is less than the base.

The base case is when x is less than the base, it simply returns the number as a string.

In the recursive case, the function calls itself with the quotient of the original number divided by the base, concatenates the string representation of the remainder to the end, and returns this new string. This is the "divide and conquer" part of the recursion.

The function works by repeatedly breaking down the problem into smaller, identical subproblems until it can solve the problem directly.

In this case, the subproblems are the same problem but with a smaller number.

In the end, the function will have broken down the original problem into a problem that can be solved directly (the base case), and combined the solutions of the subproblems to solve the original problem.

This is a classic example of divide and conquer strategy in computer science.
