This code will generate a sequence of Tribonacci numbers. The `Tri` function takes an integer `n` as an argument and returns a list of the first `n + 1` Tribonacci numbers. The sequence starts with a base case of `Tri(0) = 3`, `Tri(1) = 1`, and `Tri(2) = 2`. For `n > 2`, the sequence is generated according to the rules of the Tribonacci sequence. The function uses a for loop to iterate over the range of `n` and populate the sequence array with the generated numbers. At the end, the function returns the sequence array.

Please note that this code assumes `n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is negative, the function will not work correctly.

The time complexity of this code is O(n) because it uses a for loop to generate the sequence. The space complexity is also O(n) because it uses an array to store the sequence.

Here is the test code:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println(Tri(3))  // [3.00, 1.00, 2.00, 8.00]
    fmt.Println(Tri(10)) // [3.00, 1.00, 2.00, 8.00, 5.00, 11.00, 1
