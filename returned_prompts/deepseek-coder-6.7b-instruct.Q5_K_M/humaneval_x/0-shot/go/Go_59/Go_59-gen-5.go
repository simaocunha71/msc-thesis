This function works by continuously dividing the input number `n` by its smallest possible divisor `i` until `n` is no longer divisible by `i`. After this, the next possible divisor is `i + 1`, and so on.

The loop continues until `i` is larger than the square root of `n`, because a larger factor of `n` would be a multiple of a smaller factor that has already been tested.

The reason the loop continues until `i * i <= n` is because `i` is guaranteed to divide `n` if `n >= i * i`, and we want to check all possible factors of `n`.

After the loop, `n` will be the largest prime factor of the input number.

The time complexity of this function is O(sqrt(n)), because in the worst case, we divide `n` by all numbers up to its square root.

The space complexity is O(1), because we only use a single integer variable `i` to keep track of the current divisor.

Note: The function does not check if the input number `n` is a prime. In the function's current form, it will return the largest prime factor of any number `n`, not just composite numbers.

Also, this function assumes that the input number `n` is greater than 1 and is not a prime. If `n` is a prime number, the function will return `n` itself.

This function is written in Go, a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google.
