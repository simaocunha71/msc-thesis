This code implements the LargestPrimeFactor function, which finds the largest prime factor of a given number. It does this by repeatedly dividing the number by its smallest possible factor (starting at 2) until the number is no longer divisible. If the resulting number is still greater than 2, it is a prime number and is the largest prime factor.

The IsPrime function checks if a number is prime by dividing it by all numbers up to its square root. If any of these divisions has a remainder of 0, the number is not prime.

The time complexity of this code is O(sqrt(n)) because the largest prime factor can't be larger than the square root of n. The space complexity is O(1) because no additional space is used.

The code is written in Go and it's divided into different sections for better readability and understanding.

This function can be used to find the largest prime factor of
