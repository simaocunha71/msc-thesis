## Explanation

The function `Minsubarraysum` takes an array of integers `nums` as an input and returns the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array of `nums`.

The function starts by initializing the variable `min` to the maximum possible integer value and `sum` to 0. It then iterates over each number in `nums`. For each number, it adds the number to `sum` and checks if `sum` is less than `min`. If `sum` is less than `min`, it updates `min` with `sum`. It then sets `sum` to the maximum between `sum` and the number.

Finally, the function returns the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array of `nums`.

The function `Minsubarraysum` uses the `math.MaxInt64` constant to initialize the `min` variable, which is the maximum possible integer value. This is because the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array of `nums` can be at most the sum of all the elements in `nums`, which can be as large as `math.MaxInt64`.

The function `Minsubarraysum` also uses the `math.Max` function to update the `sum` variable. The `math.Max` function returns the maximum between `sum` and the number. This ensures that `sum` only increases if the current number is greater than the current `sum`. If the current number is less than or equal to the current `sum`, `sum` remains the same.

This function is a dynamic programming solution. It keeps track of the minimum sum of non-empty sub-arrays ending at each index, and returns the minimum sum found.

This function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`, because it iterates over the array once. The space complexity
