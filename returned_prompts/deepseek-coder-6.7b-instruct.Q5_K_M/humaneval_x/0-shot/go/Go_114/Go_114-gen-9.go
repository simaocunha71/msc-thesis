    min := math.MaxInt32
    sum := 0
    for _, num := range nums {
        if num < min {
            min = num
        }
        sum += num
    }
    if min < 0 {
        return sum + min
    }
    return sum - min
}
```

The code first initializes `min` to the maximum integer and `sum` to 0. It then iterates over `nums` and, if `num` is smaller than `min`, it updates `min`. It also adds `num` to `sum`. Finally, it checks whether `min` is negative and returns `sum + min` if it is, or `sum - min` otherwise.

This solution works by finding the smallest element in the array and summing all elements in the array. If the smallest element is negative, the sum of all elements minus the smallest element (which is the smallest sum of a non-empty sub-array) is returned. Otherwise, the sum of all elements plus the smallest element is returned.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) and the space complexity is O(1), where n is the length of `nums`.

The problem is not about finding the minimum sum, but about finding the minimum subarray sum. The minimum sum of a subarray can be found by summing all elements and subtracting the minimum element if the minimum element is positive or adding the minimum element if the minimum element is negative.

So, the solution is not correct. The correct solution is to find the minimum subarray sum. The minimum subarray sum can be found by sorting the array and summing up the first k elements, where k is the number of negative elements in the array.

Here is the corrected solution:

```go
import (
    "sort"
)

func Minsubarraysum(nums []int) int {
    sort.Ints(nums)
    sum := 0
    negCount := 0
    for _, num := range nums {
        if num < 0 {
            negCount++
            sum += num
        } else {
            break
        }
    }
    if negCount%2 == 0 {
        return sum
    }
    return sum -
