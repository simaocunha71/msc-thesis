This is a Caesar cipher, where the characters in the alphabet are shifted down by a certain amount. In this case, the shift is 2 * 2 (4 places). The characters are circular, meaning that if the shift goes past 'z', it wraps around to the start of the alphabet.

B:
The function iterates over each character in the input string. If the character is not a letter, it is added to the result string as is. If it is a letter, its index in the alphabet is found, and the shift is applied. The new index is calculated by taking the remainder of the sum of the index and the shift divided by the length of the alphabet. If the original character was uppercase, the new character is uppercase. Otherwise, it is lowercase. The new character is added to the result string.

The function returns the result string, which is the input string encrypted with a Caesar cipher.
