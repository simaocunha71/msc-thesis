The function `Encrypt` takes a string `s` as argument and returns the encrypted string. It iterates over each character in `s`. If the character is a lowercase or uppercase letter, it rotates it two places down the alphabet (multiplied by 2), then takes the remainder when divided by 26 (to wrap around the alphabet), and adds the ASCII value of 'a' or 'A' (depending on if it was upper or lower case) to get the new encrypted character. If the character is not a letter, it leaves it as is.

The function then returns the final encrypted string.

In Go, the `%` operator returns the remainder of the division operation. 

The `+=` operator is used to add the string to the variable `result`.

The `range` keyword is used in a `for` loop to iterate over each character in the string. It returns two values on each iteration: the index and the Unicode code point of the character. Since we don't need the index, we use the blank identifier `_` to ignore it.

The `&&` operator is used for logical AND. It returns true if both operands are true.

The `||` operator is used for logical OR. It returns true if either of the operands is true.

The `==` operator is used for equality checks. It returns true if the operands are equal.

The `=` operator is used for assignment. It sets the value of the left operand to the value of the right operand.

The `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `！=` operators are used for comparison. They return true if the condition is
