### Goal
The goal of this problem is to find the two closest numbers in the list of numbers and return them in ascending order. 

### Solution
The solution provided finds the two closest numbers by sorting the array first and then iterating through the array to find the two numbers that have the smallest difference. This difference is stored in the variable `minDiff`. If a smaller difference is found, `minDiff` is updated and the two numbers are stored in the `result` array. Finally, the `result` array is returned.

### Complexity
The time complexity of the solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the length of the input list. The space complexity is O(1) as no additional space is used.

### Test Cases
The provided test cases cover different scenarios:

- when there are two numbers in the list that are exactly the same
- when the smallest difference is at the beginning of the list
- when the smallest difference is at the end of the list
- when the smallest difference is in the middle of the list

These test cases cover all possible scenarios and should pass.
