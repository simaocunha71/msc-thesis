balance := 0

for _, operation := range operations {
    balance += operation
    if balance < 0 {
        return true
    }
}
return false
}

```

## 1.2.3. Tests

You can use the following test cases to verify the code:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println(BelowZero([]int{1, 2, 3})) // Expected output: false
    fmt.Println(BelowZero([]int{1, 2, -4, 5})) // Expected output: true
    fmt.Println(BelowZero([]int{100, -100, 50, -50, -150})) // Expected output: true
    fmt.Println(BelowZero([]int{100, -100, 50, -50, 150})) // Expected output: false
}
```

## 1.2.4. Output

The output of the test cases will be:

```
false
true
true
false
```

This means that the function works correctly and returns the correct result for the given inputs.

## 1.2.5. Time and Space Complexity

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of operations. This is because the function iterates over the operations array once.

The space complexity is O(1), which means the memory used does not grow with the input size. This is because the function uses a constant amount of memory to store the balance and the operation.

## 1.2.6. Conclusion

This function can be used to check if the balance of a bank account falls below zero at any point. It works by iterating over the operations and updating the balance at each step. If the balance ever falls below zero, the function immediately returns true. Otherwise, it returns false after all the operations have been processed.

The time and space complexity of this function is efficient, making it suitable for large inputs.
