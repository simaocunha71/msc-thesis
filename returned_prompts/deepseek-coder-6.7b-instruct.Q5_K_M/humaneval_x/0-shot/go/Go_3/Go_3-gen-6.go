// Here is a solution in Go:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func BelowZero(operations []int) bool {
	balance := 0
	for _, op := range operations {
		balance += op
		if balance < 0 {
			return true
		}
	}
	return false
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(BelowZero([]int{1, 2, 3}))        // false
	fmt.Println(BelowZero([]int{1, 2, -4, 5}))    // true
}
```

// This solution works by iterating over each operation in the input slice. For each operation, it
// adds the value to the current balance. If at any point the balance is less than zero, the function
// immediately returns true to signify that the balance has fallen below zero. If the function
// iterates through all operations without the balance falling below zero, it returns false.
```

// This is a simple solution with a time complexity of O(n) as we are only looping through the operations once.

```

// The space complexity is also O(n), but we are only storing one integer (balance) at any given time,
// so it's considered constant space.
```
```

// The solution is also very clear and readable.

```
```
```

// Overall, it's a good solution for the problem.
