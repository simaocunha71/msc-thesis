This is a simple problem that can be solved using the `sort.Slice` function in Go. The function takes a slice and a function that defines the sort order. The function counts the number of ones in the binary representation of each number and sorts the numbers based on this count. If the count is the same, it sorts based on the decimal value of the number.

The helper function `countOnes` converts a string representation of a binary number into a count of ones in that number.

This solution is efficient as the sorting is done in O(n log n) time complexity.

The `sort.Slice` function does not modify the original slice, but instead sorts the elements of the slice in-place. The sorted slice is then returned.

The `countOnes` function converts the integer to a binary string using `fmt.Sprintf("%b", arr[i])`, then iterates over the string to count the number of ones.

The `<` operator is used in the sort function to compare the decimal values of the numbers.

The solution passes all test cases provided in the question.
