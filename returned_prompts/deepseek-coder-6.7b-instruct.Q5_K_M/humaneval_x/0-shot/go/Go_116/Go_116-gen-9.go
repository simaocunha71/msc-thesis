This is the best solution from the available ones. It uses the built-in `sort.Slice` function from the Go standard library to sort the array based on the custom comparison function. The comparison function counts the number of ones in the binary representation of each number, and if counts are equal, it compares the decimal values of the numbers.

The helper function `bitCount` is used to count the number of ones in the binary representation of a number. It does this by continuously dividing the number by 2 and incrementing a counter if the remainder is 1.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sort operation, and a space complexity of O(n) for storing the sorted array.

Note that this solution assumes that the input array only contains non-negative integers. If negative integers could be part of the input, the sorting operation would need to be adjusted accordingly.

The solution also assumes that the input array does not contain duplicate values. If duplicate values could be part of the input, the sorting operation would need to be adjusted to handle this case.

The solution also assumes that the input array does not contain zeros. If zeros could be part of the input, the sorting operation would need to be adjusted to handle this case.

In the provided code, the sorting operation is performed in ascending order. If you need the array to be sorted in descending order, you would need to
