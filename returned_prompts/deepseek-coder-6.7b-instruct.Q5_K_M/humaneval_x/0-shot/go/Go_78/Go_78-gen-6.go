This program uses a for loop to iterate over each character in the input string. It then uses a switch case statement to check if each character is one of the hexadecimal digits that are prime, and if so, increments a counter. Finally, the function returns the count of such prime hexadecimal digits.

The program then tests the function with various inputs.


```go
2
2
2
6
2
```

These are the results for the given inputs.

This is because '2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', and 'D' are the prime hexadecimal digits.
