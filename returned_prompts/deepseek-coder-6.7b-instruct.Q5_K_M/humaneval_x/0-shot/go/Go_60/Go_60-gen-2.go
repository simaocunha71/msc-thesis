// Solution:

// The function SumToN calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to n using a simple mathematical formula.
// The formula is n*(n+1)/2. This formula calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to n in constant time, regardless of the value of n.
// The time complexity of this function is O(1), which is the best possible time complexity for this problem.

return n * (n + 1) / 2
}

func main() {

B:

// Test the function with some examples:
fmt.Println(SumToN(30))  // should print 465
fmt.Println(SumToN(100))  // should print 5050
fmt.Println(SumToN(5))  // should print 15
fmt.Println(SumToN(10))  // should print 55
fmt.Println(SumToN(1))  // should print 1

C:

}
```

Explanation:
The problem is about calculating the sum of numbers from 1 to n. We can solve it using a simple mathematical formula, which is n*(n+1)/2. This formula calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to n in constant time, regardless of the value of n.

The time complexity of this function is O(1), which is the best possible time complexity for this problem.

In the main function, we test the function with some examples:

- SumToN(30) should return 465
- SumToN(100) should return 5050
- SumToN(5) should return 15
- SumToN(10) should return 55
- SumToN(1) should return 1

This is a simple example of how to write a function in Go.
