This code defines a function that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to n. It uses a for loop to iterate over each number from 1 to n, adding each number to a sum variable. Finally, it returns the sum.

The time complexity of this code is O(n), because there is one loop that runs n times. The space complexity is O(1), because the code uses a constant amount of space to store the sum and the loop variables.

Please note that this code is written in Go programming language.

## Code Explanation:

1. We start by declaring a variable `sum` and initializing it to 0. This variable will store the sum of the numbers from 1 to n.

2. We then use a `for` loop to iterate over each number from 1 to n. The `i` variable in the loop represents the current number.

3. In each iteration of the loop, we add the current number `i` to `sum`.

4. After the loop finishes, `sum` will hold the sum of all numbers from 1 to n. We then return `sum`.

5. This function will return the sum of numbers from 1 to n when called with a specific value of `n`. For example, `SumToN(5)` will return 15 (which is the sum of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5), and `SumToN(10)` will return 55 (which is the sum of 1 to 10).

6. If `n` is 1, the function will return 1 (since there's only one number: 1).

7. If `n` is less than 1, the function will return 0 (since there
