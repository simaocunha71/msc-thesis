    for i := 0; i < len(str); i++ {

// Output:

```

**Explanation:**

The function `AllPrefixes` takes a string as input and returns a slice of all prefixes of that string from shortest to longest. It does this by iterating over the string, appending each prefix to the results slice and finally returning the results slice.

**Time Complexity:**

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because we are iterating over the string once.

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because we are storing all the prefixes in the result slice.

**Constraints:**

The input string will not be empty.

**Edge Cases:**

This function will handle edge cases where the string is a single character or is an empty string. In both cases, the function will return a slice with the single character or an empty slice, respectively.
