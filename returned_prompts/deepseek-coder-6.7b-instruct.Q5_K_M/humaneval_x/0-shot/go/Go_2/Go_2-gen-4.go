    return number - float64(int(number))
}

Both solutions are correct. The first one subtracts the floor of the number from the number, effectively giving us the fractional part. The second one subtracts the integer part of the number from the number, again giving us the fractional part.


A: The second solution is more straightforward and efficient. 

It subtracts the integer part of the number from the number itself. 

In simple terms, it takes the number and subtracts the whole part of the number. The result is the decimal part of the number. 

In the example given, the number is 3.5. The integer part of 3.5 is 3 and subtracting 3 from 3.5 gives 0.5, which is the decimal part of the number.

This solution uses the int() function to get the integer part of the number and then subtracts it from the number. The result is a float64, which is the decimal part of the number.

Here is the code for the second solution:

```go
func TruncateNumber(number float64) float64 {
    return number - float64(int(number))
}
```

So, if you call TruncateNumber(3.5), it will return 0.5.

I hope this explanation helps you understand how the function works.

Note: The math.Floor function is not used in the second solution, because it's not needed to get the integer part of the number. It's used in the first solution because it's a common way to get the integer part of a number in Go.


A: Here is the solution using math package:

```go
import (
    "math"
)

func TruncateNumber(number float64) float64 {
    _, decimal := math.Modf(number)
    return decimal
}
```

This function uses the Modf function from the math package to separate the integer part from the decimal part of the number. The Modf function returns two values: the integer part of the number and the fractional part of the number. We
