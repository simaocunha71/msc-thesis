This program checks if the given sides can form a valid triangle. If not, it returns -1.
If the triangle is valid, it calculates the semi-perimeter s of the triangle. Then it calculates the area using Heron's formula. The area is rounded to 2 decimal points before it's returned.
S:
The semi-perimeter of the triangle is calculated by adding all the sides and dividing by 2. This value is used in Heron's formula to calculate the area of the triangle.
