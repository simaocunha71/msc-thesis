// This problem is a variation of the classic Fibonacci sequence problem. We simply need to add an additional term to the sum for each new Fibfib number.
// We can solve it by using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach where we store the results of smaller sub-problems to use them in larger ones.

// If the input number is less than 0, we return 0 because it's not valid.
	if n < 0 {
		return 0
	}

	// If the input number is 0 or 1, we return 0 because the Fibfib sequence starts from 0.
	if n == 0 || n == 1 {
		return 0
	}

	// If the input number is 2, we return 1 because the third element of the Fibfib sequence is 1.
	if n == 2 {
		return 1
	}

	// We initialize an array to store the Fibfib sequence up to the nth element.
	Fibfib := make([]int, n+1)

	// The first three elements of the Fibfib sequence are 0, 0, 1.
	Fibfib[0] = 0
	Fibfib[1] = 0
	Fibfib[2] = 1

	// We calculate the Fibfib sequence from 3 to n.
	for i := 3; i <= n; i++ {
		Fibfib[i] = Fibfib[i-1] + Fibfib[i-2] + Fibfib[i-3]
	}

	// We return the nth element of the Fibfib sequence.
	return Fibfib[n]
}

```

**Complexity Analysis**

The time complexity of the above solution is O(n) because we are looping from 3 to n and the space complexity is also O(n) because we are storing the sequence up to the nth element.

**Optimization**

We can optimize the space complexity to O(1) because we only need the last three elements of the sequence to compute the next one. Here is the optimized code:

```go
func Fibfib(n int) int {
