// This solution works by using dynamic programming to store the Fibfib numbers in an array, and then using this array to compute the Fibfib numbers. This avoids the need for excessive recursion and computation, resulting in a much more efficient solution.

// The time complexity of this solution is O(n), and the space complexity is O(n), as we are storing all the computed Fibfib numbers up to n.

// This solution should work for all positive integers of n.

// This solution can be adapted for other similar sequences by changing the base cases and the recursive relation.

// This solution assumes that n is a non-negative integer. If n is negative, the function should return an error or an appropriate message.

// This solution uses a top-down approach to solve the problem, which means it starts from the top and works its way down. This is a common technique in dynamic programming.

// This solution uses memoization, a technique in dynamic programming where we store the results of expensive function calls and reuse them when the same inputs occur again. This can greatly improve the efficiency of the program.

// This solution uses recursion to solve the problem, which means it calls itself in its definition. This is a common technique in dynamic programming.

// This solution is written in Go, which is a statically typed, compiled language. It is known for its efficiency and performance.
