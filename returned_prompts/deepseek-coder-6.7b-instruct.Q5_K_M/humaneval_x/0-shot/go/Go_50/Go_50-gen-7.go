You've just copied the code from your question and made minor adjustments to the indentation. I'm assuming you want to define and use two functions: EncodeShift and DecodeShift. They work with Caesar cipher, where each character in the string is shifted 5 positions in the alphabet. If the character is 'z', it wraps around to 'a'.
