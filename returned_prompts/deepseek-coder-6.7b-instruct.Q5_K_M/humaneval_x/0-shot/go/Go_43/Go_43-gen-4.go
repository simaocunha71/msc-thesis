In this function, we sort the list and then use two pointers to find the pair. One starts from the beginning and the other starts from the end. If the sum of the two numbers pointed by the two pointers is less than zero, we increment the start pointer, otherwise if the sum is more than zero, we decrement the end pointer. If the sum equals zero, we return true. If we have traversed the whole list and have not found the pair, we return false.

The time complexity of this function is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation and the space complexity is O(1) as we are not using any extra space.

This solution works for any input list of integers. It will return false if the list has less than two elements.

Note: This solution assumes that the input list does not contain duplicate elements. If the input list can contain duplicate elements, we will need to modify the solution to handle this case.
