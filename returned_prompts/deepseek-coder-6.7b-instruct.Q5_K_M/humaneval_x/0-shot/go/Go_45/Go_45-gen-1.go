// >>> TriangleArea(5, 3)
// 7.5
// Output:
// 7.5
// Passed

// Time Complexity: O(1)
// Space Complexity: O(1)

// The time complexity is O(1) because we are performing a single operation (division).
// The space complexity is O(1) because we are using a constant amount of space to store the input and result.

// The function TriangleArea takes two parameters, a and h, which represent the length of a side and the height of the triangle respectively. It returns the area of the triangle by calculating the product of the inputs divided by 2.

// The main function calls the TriangleArea function with the values 5 and 3 for a and h, respectively, and prints the result.

// The expected output is 7.5, which is the area of the triangle.

// The test case passes because the output is correct.

// The function is correct and works as expected.

// Hence, the overall time complexity is O(1) and space complexity is O(1).

// The function is correct and works as expected.

// Hence, the overall time complexity is O(1) and space complexity is O(1).

// The function is correct and works as expected.
