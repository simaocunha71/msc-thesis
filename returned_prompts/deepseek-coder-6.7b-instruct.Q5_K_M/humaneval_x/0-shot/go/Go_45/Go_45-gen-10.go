// Output: 7.5
// The area of the triangle is calculated by multiplying the base by the height and then dividing by 2. 
// Here, the base is 5 and the height is 3. So, the area is 0.5 * 5 * 3 = 7.5.

// Note that this function assumes that the input values are positive and non-zero. If you need to handle negative or zero values, you would need to add additional error checking code.

// Also note that this function assumes that the input values are of type float64. If they are not, you would need to convert them to float64 before performing the calculations. You can do this using the `float64()` function in Go.

// Lastly, this function does not handle any errors that may occur during the calculation. If you need to handle potential errors, you would need to add appropriate error handling code.
