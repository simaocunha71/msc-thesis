In Go programming language, the syntax to convert an integer to a string is `strconv.Itoa(n)`.

B:
We initialize the variable `product` to 1. This will store the product of the odd digits.

C:
We iterate over each character in the string. For each character, we convert it back to an integer using `strconv.Atoi(string(c))`. If the digit is odd (i.e., the remainder when divided by 2 is not 0), we multiply the current `product` by this digit.

Finally, we return the `product`. If no odd digits were found, the `product` will still be 1.

This function will return 0 if all digits are even.

It should be noted that if a number ends with an even digit (except for 0 itself), the function will return 0 because we are multiplying the product by the digit only if it is odd.

For example, if the number is 248, the function will return 0 because the digit 2 is even, but the digit 8 is odd.
