    return B
}

I am trying to understand what is the error in the above code. 

A: Your code has a syntax error. There's an extra closing bracket at the end of your code.

The correct code is:
import (
    "strconv"
)

func Digits(n int) int {
    s := strconv.Itoa(n)
    r := 1

    for _, c := range s {
        d, _ := strconv.Atoi(string(c))
        if d%2 != 0 {
            r *= d
        }
    }

    if r == n {
        return 0
    } else {
        return r
    }
}

This code works as follows:


*

*It converts the integer n to a string s.

*It initializes an integer r to 1, which will be used to store the product of the odd digits.

*It then iterates through each character c in the string s.

*For each character, it converts it back to an integer d and checks if it's odd.

*If the digit is odd, it multiplies r by that digit.

*After going through all the digits, if r is still equal to n (which means all digits were even), it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns r.


Please note that the code uses the blank identifier (_) to ignore the error return value from strconv.Atoi. In a real-world situation, you'd want to handle this error.

A: You have a syntax error at the last closing brace.

The correct code is:
import (
