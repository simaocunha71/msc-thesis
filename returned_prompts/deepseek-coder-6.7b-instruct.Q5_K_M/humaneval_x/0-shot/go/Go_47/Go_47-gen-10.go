The median of a list of numbers is the middle number if the numbers are arranged in order. 

The code in the function Median first sorts the list of numbers in ascending order. If the number of elements in the list is even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. 

If the number of elements in the list is odd, the median is the middle number. 

The function returns the median as a float64.
