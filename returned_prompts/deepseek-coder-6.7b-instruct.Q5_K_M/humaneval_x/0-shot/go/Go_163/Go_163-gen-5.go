## Solution

```go
func GenerateIntegers(a, b int) []int {
    if a > b {
        a, b = b, a
    }
    var result []int
    for i := a; i <= b; i++ {
        if i%2 == 0 {
            result = append(result, i)
        }
    }
    return result
}
```

This function works by first making sure `a` is less than or equal to `b`. Then it iterates over all integers from `a` to `b` (inclusive). If the integer is even (i.e., it is divisible by 2), it is added to the result slice. Finally, the result slice is returned.

Note that the `%` operator is used to check if a number is even. If `i % 2` equals 0, then `i` is even.

In Go, the append function is used to add elements to a slice. The syntax is `append(slice, elements...)`, where `...` indicates that you can pass any number of additional arguments.

This function runs in O(n) time, where n is the difference between `b` and `a`. This is because it needs to iterate over every integer between `a` and `b`.

This function uses O(n) space, where n is the number of even integers between `a` and `b`. This is because it needs to store the even integers in a slice.

## Explanation

This problem is about understanding how to iterate over a range of numbers and how to check if a number is even. The key to solving this problem is to write a loop that iterates over all the numbers between `a` and `b` (inclusive), and checks if each number is even. If a number is even, it is added to a result slice. The function then returns this result slice.

The function also handles the case where `a` is greater than `b` by swapping the values of `a` and `b`.

Finally, the function uses the `append` function to add elements to a slice. This function is a built-in function in Go that returns a new slice with the added elements. The
