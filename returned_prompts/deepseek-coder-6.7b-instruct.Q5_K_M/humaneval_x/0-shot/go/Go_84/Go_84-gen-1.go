A: The code provided takes an input integer, N, and calculates the sum of its digits. It then converts this sum to a binary string using the strconv.FormatInt function.

The sum of the digits is calculated by taking the remainder of the division of N by 10 (this gives the last digit of N), adding this digit to the sum, and then dividing N by 10 (removing the last digit). This is done until N is 0.

The strconv.FormatInt function converts the integer sum to a binary string. The second argument to FormatInt is the base of the number to be converted, so 2 means binary. The result is a string of the binary representation of the sum of the digits of N.

The result is then returned by the Solve function.

The main function tests the Solve function with the values 1000, 150, and 147, and prints the results.
