	n := len(text)

B:

	if n <= 1 {
		return true
	}

C:

	if text[0] != text[n-1] {
		return false
	}

D:

	return IsPalindrome(text[1 : n-1])
}

```

This recursive function works by checking if the first and last characters of the given string are the same. If they are not, the function returns false. If they are the same, the function calls itself with the string minus the first and last character, and continues checking. This process repeats until the length of the string is less than or equal to 1, at which point the function returns true because an empty string or a string of length 1 is a palindrome.

Here is an equivalent iterative version of the function:
