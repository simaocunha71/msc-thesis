    // We create a reversed copy of the given string and compare it to the original
    reversed := Reverse(text)

    return text == reversed
}

Reverse function:

// Reverse takes a string and returns the reversed version of the string
func Reverse(text string) string {

B:

    // Initialize an empty string to hold the reversed text
    reversed := ""

    // Iterate over the given string from end to start
    for i := len(text) - 1; i >= 0; i-- {

C:

        // Add the current character to the reversed string
        reversed += string(text[i])
    }

    return reversed
}

Testing:

func main() {

D:

    fmt.Println(IsPalindrome("")) // Expected: true
    fmt.Println(IsPalindrome("aba")) // Expected: true
    fmt.Println(IsPalindrome("aaaaa")) // Expected: true
    fmt.Println(IsPalindrome("zbcd")) // Expected: false
}

```

This program works by first using the Reverse function to create a reversed copy of the given string. It then checks if the reversed string is identical to the original string. If it is, the function returns true, meaning the string is a palindrome. If it is not, the function returns false, meaning the string is not a palindrome.

The Reverse function works by iterating over the given string from end to start, adding each character to a new string. This new string is then returned as the reversed version of the given string.

The testing part of the program simply calls the IsPalindrome function with a few different strings to verify that it is working correctly.

The time complexity of this program is O(n) because it iterates over the string once to reverse it and once more to compare it to the original string. The space complexity is also O(n) because it creates a new string to hold the reversed string.

The program is written in Go, a statically typed, compiled programming language developed by Google. It is suitable for web development, cloud
