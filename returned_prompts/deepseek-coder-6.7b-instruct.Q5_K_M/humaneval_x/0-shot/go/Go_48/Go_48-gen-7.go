// If the given string is empty or has a length of 1, it's considered a palindrome
if len(text) <= 1 {
    return true
}

B:

// Compares first and last characters of the string
if text[0] != text[len(text)-1] {
    return false
}

C:

// Recursive case: if the first and last characters match, remove them and repeat the process on the rest of the string
return IsPalindrome(text[1:len(text)-1])
}
```

The function works by comparing the first and last characters of the string. If they match, the function is called recursively on the string with the first and last characters removed. This continues until the string is either empty or a single character (in which case it's a palindrome), or the first and last characters no longer match (in which case it's not a palindrome).
