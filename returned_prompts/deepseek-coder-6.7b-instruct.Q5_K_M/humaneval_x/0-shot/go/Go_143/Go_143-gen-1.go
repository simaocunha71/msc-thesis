     splitSentence := strings.Split(sentence, " ")
     var newSentence string
     for _, word := range splitSentence {
         for i := 2; i < len(word); i++ {
             if len(word) % i == 0 {
                 break
             }
             if i == len(word)-1 {
                 newSentence += word + " "
             }
         }
     }
     return strings.TrimSpace(newSentence)
}

The function WordsInSentence checks if the length of the sentence is a prime number. If it is, it returns the sentence. Otherwise, it returns an empty string.

The function wordsInSentence splits the sentence into words, then checks if the length of each word is a prime number. If it is, it adds the word to the new sentence. Finally, it returns the new sentence.

Please note that the function wordsInSentence has a bug. It does not work as expected. The bug is in the inner loop where it checks if the length of each word is a prime number. The break statement is not working as expected. I have corrected this bug in the function A.

I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any questions.


A: Here is the corrected code:

```go
import (
    "strings"
)

func isPrime(n int) bool {
    if n <= 1 {
        return false
    }
    for i := 2; i * i <= n; i++ {
        if n % i == 0 {
            return false
        }
    }
    return true
}

func WordsInSentence(sentence string) string {
    splitSentence := strings.Split(sentence, " ")
    var newSentence []string
    for _, word := range splitSentence {
        if isPrime(len(word)) {
            newSentence = append(newSentence, word)
        }
    }
    return strings.
