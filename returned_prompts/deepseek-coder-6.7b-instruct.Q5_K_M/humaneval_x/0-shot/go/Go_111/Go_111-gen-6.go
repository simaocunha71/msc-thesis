This is a simple solution, we first create a map to count the occurrences of each letter. Then we find the maximum occurrence (max), and finally, we create another map (result) that contains only the letters that have a count equal to max.

The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because we go through the string once to count the occurrences and once more to find the maximum occurrence. The space complexity is also O(n), because in the worst case, every letter could be unique, and we would therefore need to store a count for each letter in the input string.

The code seems to work correctly according to the examples you provided. However, please note that this solution assumes that the input string contains only lowercase letters and spaces. If the input string can contain other characters, you should add a check to ignore those characters.

Also, note that this solution uses the built-in map type in Go, which is a hash table. The time complexity of the operations that modify the map (like incrementing the count for a letter) is O(1) on average, which means that the time it takes to perform these operations does not grow with the size of the map. However, in the worst case (when all keys hash to the same index), the time complexity can be O(n), so it's still considered O(1) on average.

Finally, note that this solution does not handle the case where the input string is empty. If that is a possibility, you should add a special case to handle it.

Also, note that this solution does not handle the case where the input string contains uppercase letters. If that is a possibility, you should add a special case to handle it.
