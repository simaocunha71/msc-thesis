The function Histogram() takes a string as argument, and it creates a histogram of the occurrence of each letter in the string. The function then goes through the histogram to find the maximum occurrence of any letter.
Finally, it creates a new map that only includes the letters that have the maximum occurrence and returns it.

In the given example, the string 'a b c' contains only one unique letter 'a', 'b' and 'c'. So, all of them will be returned with their corresponding count of 1.

The string 'a b b a' contains two unique letters 'a' and 'b'. The letter 'b' has the maximum occurrence of 2. So, only 'b' will be returned with its corresponding count of 2.

The string 'a b c a b' also contains two unique letters 'a' and 'b'. The letter 'b' has the maximum occurrence of 2. So, only 'b' will be returned with its corresponding count of 2.

The string 'b b b b a' contains only one unique letter 'b'. The letter 'b' has the maximum occurrence of 4. So, only 'b' will be returned with its corresponding count of 4.

In the case of an empty string, an empty map will be returned.
