## Explanation

The code checks if the string is happy or not. If the string's length is less than 3, it returns false because a string cannot be happy in this case.

If the string's length is at least 3, the code will check every 3 consecutive letters of the string. If any of the letters are the same, the code will return false because a string can't be happy in this case. If the code doesn't find any such letters, it returns true meaning the string is happy.

## Possible Improvements

- The code could be optimized by using a set to store the letters that have already been checked. This would reduce the time complexity from O(n) to O(1) for each letter, where n is the length of the string.
- The code could be optimized by using a sliding window approach to check the 3 consecutive letters in a single pass. This would reduce the time complexity from O(n) to O(1).
- The code could be optimized by using a map to store the frequency of each letter. If any letter repeats, the string is not happy. This would reduce the time complexity from O(n) to O(1) for each letter.

## Test Cases

```go
func TestIsHappy(t *testing.T) {
	testCases := []struct {
		name  string
		s     string
		want  bool
	}{
		{"case 1", "a", false},
		{"case 2", "aa", false},
		{"case 3", "abcd", true},
		{"case 4", "aabb", false},
		{"case 5", "adb", true},
		{"case 6", "xyy", false},
	}

	for _, tc := range testCases {
