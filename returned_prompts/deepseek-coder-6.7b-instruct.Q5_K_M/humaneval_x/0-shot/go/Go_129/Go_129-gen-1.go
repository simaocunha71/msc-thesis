// We need to find the minimum path in the grid.
// This can be achieved by using a priority queue (heap)
// to keep track of the minimum path that we have seen so far.
// We can start from any cell in the grid and explore all the neighboring cells.
// We also need to keep track of the path that we have taken so far.

// First, we convert the 2D grid into a 1D array so that we can easily
// access the neighboring cells.

// Then, we initialize a heap with the cell values of the grid.
// We also initialize a variable 'result' to store the minimum path.

// We then start from the first cell and explore all the neighboring cells.
// For each neighboring cell, we check if we have already visited it before.
// If we have, we skip it. If not, we add it to the heap and update the result.

// We continue this process until we have visited k cells.
// The result will then be the minimum path of length k.

// Finally, we convert the result back from a 1D array to a 2D array and return it.

// This algorithm has a time complexity of O(N^2 * log(N^2)) and a space complexity of O(N^2).

// Please note that the actual implementation of this algorithm will be quite complex and
// may require some understanding of data structures and algorithms.
