            } else if unicode.IsLower(char) {
                strength--

        if strength > max_strength {
            max_strength = strength
            strongest_extension = extension
        }
    }
    return class_name + "." + strongest_extension
}
```

## Solution
The solution uses a simple loop to iterate through each extension in the list and compute the strength of the extension. The strength of an extension is calculated by adding one for every uppercase letter in the extension's name and subtracting one for every lowercase letter. The extension with the highest strength is then returned.

## Test Cases

```go
func main() {
    fmt.Println(StrongestExtension("my_class", []string{"AA", "Be", "CC"})) // Should print: "my_class.AA"
    fmt.Println(StrongestExtension("Slices", []string{"SErviNGSliCes", "Cheese", "StuFfed"})) // Should print: "Slices.SErviNGSliCes"
    fmt.Println(StrongestExtension("Fruits", []string{"FruitLoops", "FruitFlies", "FruitFlies"})) // Should print: "Fruits.FruitFlies"
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
The time complexity of this solution is O(n*m), where n is the number of extensions and m is the average length of the extension's name. This is because we are looping through each character in each extension to compute the strength of the extension.

The space complexity is O(1), since we are only using a constant amount of space to store the maximum strength and the strongest extension. The space required does not increase with the size of the input.

## Note
This solution assumes that all characters in the extension names are either uppercase or lowercase. If there are other characters in
