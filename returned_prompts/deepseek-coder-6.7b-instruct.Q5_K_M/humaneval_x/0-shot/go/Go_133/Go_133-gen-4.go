    sum := 0
    for _, v := range lst {
        sum += int(math.Pow(math.Ceil(v), 2))
    }
    return sum
}
```

## Solution

The problem requires us to square each number in the given list, round them to the upper int(Ceiling) first, and then sum them up. This can be accomplished using a simple loop that iterates over the list of numbers, uses the math.Ceil function to round each number to the upper integer, uses the math.Pow function to square the rounded number, and then adds the result to a running total.

The solution provided is correct and efficient. It uses the math.Ceil function to round each number to the upper integer, the math.Pow function to square the rounded number, and then adds the squared number to a running total, which is returned at the end of the function.

## Testing

Here are some test cases that you can use to verify the solution:

```go
func main() {
    fmt.Println(SumSquares([]float64{1, 2, 3})) // Expected output: 14
    fmt.Println(SumSquares([]float64{1, 4, 9})) // Expected output: 98
    fmt.Println(SumSquares([]float64{1, 3, 5, 7})) // Expected output: 84
    fmt.Println(SumSquares([]float64{1.4, 4.2, 0})) // Expected output: 29
    fmt.Println(SumSquares([]float64{-2.4, 1, 1})) // Expected output: 6
}
```

These test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including negative numbers and decimals. The expected output for each test case is provided in the comments.

## Conclusion

The provided solution is correct and efficient. It correctly rounds each number to the upper integer, squares the rounded number, and then sums the squared numbers.

This solution demonstrates the use of the `math.Ceil` and `math.Pow` functions in Go to perform
