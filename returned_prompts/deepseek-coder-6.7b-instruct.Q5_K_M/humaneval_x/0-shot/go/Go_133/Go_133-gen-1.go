A: 
The function SumSquares takes as input a list of floating point numbers (lst). It initializes a variable sum to 0. Then it iterates over each number in the list. For each number, it calculates the ceiling of the number (using math.Ceil function) and squares this value (using math.Pow function). The result is added to the sum. Finally, it returns the sum.

So, for example, if the input list is [1, 2, 3], the function will first calculate the ceiling of 1 (which is 1) and square it, then it will calculate the ceiling of 2 (which is 2) and square it, and so on. The results are then added together to give the final sum.

Note that the function uses the math.Pow function to square the number, which requires the number to be a float64 (since both the base and the exponent are float64). The result of the squaring operation is then converted back to int before being added to the sum.

So, for example, for the input [1, 2, 3], the function will calculate the sum as follows:
- For 1 (which is rounded to 1), the square is 1^2 = 1
- For 2 (which is rounded to 2), the square is 2^2 = 4
- For 3 (which is rounded to 3), the square is 3^2 = 9

The final sum is 1 + 4 + 9 = 14.
