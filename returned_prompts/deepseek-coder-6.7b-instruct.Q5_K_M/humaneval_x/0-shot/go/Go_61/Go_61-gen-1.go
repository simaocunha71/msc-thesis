    return strings.Count(brackets, "(") == strings.Count(brackets, ")")
}

In the given problem, we have to check if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. We can solve this problem using a stack data structure. The idea is to push every opening bracket in the stack and pop it when a closing bracket is encountered. If the stack is empty at the end, then every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. If not, then there is a mismatch.

In this code, we are using a slice as a stack. We push every opening bracket into the stack and pop it when a closing bracket is encountered. If the stack is not empty at the end, then there is a mismatch.

The time complexity of this code is O(n) and the space complexity is O(n). Here, n is the length of the string.

In the alternative solution, we are using the built-in function strings.Count() to count the number of opening and closing brackets. If the counts are equal, then every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. Otherwise, there is a mismatch.

Both solutions will give the same result but the alternative solution is more efficient as it only requires one pass over the string.

Note: The alternative solution assumes that the string contains only brackets and no other characters. If the string can contain other characters, then the first solution would be more suitable.
