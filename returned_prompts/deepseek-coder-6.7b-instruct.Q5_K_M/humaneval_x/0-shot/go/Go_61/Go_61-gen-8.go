    for i := 0; i < len(brackets); i++ {
        if brackets[i] == '(' {
            for j := i + 1; j < len(brackets); j++ {
                if brackets[j] == ')' {
                    brackets = strings.Replace(brackets, brackets[i:j+1], "", 1)
                    return CorrectBracketing(brackets)
                }
            }
        }
    }

B:
    if len(brackets) == 0 {
        return true
    }

C:
    return false
}

This code is incorrect because the function does not remove the brackets as expected. For example, if the input string is "()", the function will not return true, because it removes the "()" and the resulting string is "", not "". 

The correct approach is to use a stack to handle the brackets. When we see an opening bracket, we push it onto the stack. When we see a closing bracket, we pop the top of the stack. If the stack is empty when we see a closing bracket, or if the top of the stack is not the corresponding opening bracket, we return false. If we finish processing the string and the stack is empty, we return true.

Here's the correct code:

```go
func CorrectBracketing(brackets string) bool  {
    stack := []rune{}
    for _, b := range brackets {
        if b == '(' {
            stack = append(stack, b)
        } else if b == ')' {
            if len(stack) == 0 || stack[len(stack)-1] != '(' {
                return false
            }
            stack = stack[:len(stack)-1]
        }
    }
    return len(stack) == 0
}
```
This code works by iterating over the string, and for each character, if it's an opening bracket, we push it onto the stack. If it's a closing bracket, we pop the top of the stack. If the stack is empty or the top of the stack isn't the corresponding opening bracket, we return false. If we finish processing the string and the stack is empty, we
