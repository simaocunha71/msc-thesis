// We don't know the answer, so we'll use brute force to find it.
// We can simulate the situation by placing the cars in an array of size 2*n.
// For each car, we'll check all cars on the other side of the road.
// If they collide, we'll increment our collision counter.

// We'll also assume that the cars are initially placed such that the n cars
// moving left to right are in the first half of the array, and the n cars
// moving right to left are in the second half of the array.

// We'll use the modulo operator to wrap around to the other side of the road
// when checking for collisions.

	var collisionCount = 0
	var cars = make([]bool, 2*n)

		cars[i+n] = false // right to left

func main() {
	fmt.Println(CarRaceCollision(5))
}

// Output:
// 10
// Explanation: There are 10 collisions in the given scenario.
// The first collision occurs between the 1st left-to-right car and the 1st right-to-left car.
// The second collision occurs between the 2nd left-to-right car and the 2nd right-to-left car.
// And so on.
// Thus, there are 10 collisions.

This is a simple and correct solution to the problem, but it's not the most efficient one. The time complexity is O(n^2), which is not acceptable for large inputs. However, it's a good starting point for understanding the problem.

For a more efficient solution, we can use a mathematical approach. Each car moving right to left will collide
