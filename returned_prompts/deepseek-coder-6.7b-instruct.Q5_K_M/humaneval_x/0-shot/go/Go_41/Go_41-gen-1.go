B:

    // If n is 1, there is only one car. So there are no collisions. So return 0.
    if n == 1 {
        return 0
    }

C:

    // For n cars moving in opposite directions, there will be n-1 collisions.
    // This is because each car will collide with one of the other cars.
    return n - 1

}


func main() {

    fmt.Println(CarRaceCollision(3)) // Output: 2
    fmt.Println(CarRaceCollision(4)) // Output: 3
    fmt.Println(CarRaceCollision(0)) // Output: 0
    fmt.Println(CarRaceCollision(1)) // Output: 0
}

```

This program will output the number of collisions for a set of n cars moving in opposite directions. The number of collisions is calculated as n-1 because each car will collide with one of the other cars.

The function CarRaceCollision takes an integer n as input and returns the number of collisions. The function first checks if n is 0 or 1 and returns 0 if it is. If n is greater than 1, it returns n-1 as the number of collisions.

This program can be used to calculate the number of collisions in a scenario where n cars are moving in opposite directions.

NOTE: This problem is a simplified version of a real-world scenario where the cars were moving along a straight road and the collision occurred at a point of intersection. This simplified version doesn't consider the actual movement of the cars along the road.
