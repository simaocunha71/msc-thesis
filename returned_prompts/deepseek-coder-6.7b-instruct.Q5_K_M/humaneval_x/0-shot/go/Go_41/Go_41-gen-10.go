// Note:
// This is a math problem. The number of collisions depends on the number of cars.
// For n cars, there will be n*(n-1)/2 collisions.
// This is because each car in the left-going set will collide with each car in the right-going set,
// but not with itself.
```

## Code Explanation

This solution uses basic arithmetic to calculate the number of collisions. If `n` is the number of cars, then there will be `n*(n-1)/2` collisions. This is because each car in the left-going set will collide with each car in the right-going set, but not with itself.

This solution assumes that the input will be a positive integer. If `n` is 0, then there will be no collisions.

The function `CarRaceCollision(n int)` takes an integer `n` as an argument and returns the number of collisions. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the function returns 0.

The function is tested in the `main` function. It calls `CarRaceCollision(n)` with different values of `n` and prints the result.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is O(1), which means it has a constant time complexity. This is because the calculation of the number of collisions is a fixed operation, regardless of the size of the input.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity of the solution is also O(1), which means it has a constant space complexity. This is because the solution only uses a single variable to store the result, regardless of the
