// Here we just return the number of pairs of cars that collide, which is simply n*(n-1)/2.
// Since each car from one set collides with each car from the other set, and since the cars don't collide with themselves,
// this gives us the total number of collisions.

    return n*(n-1)/2

// CarRaceCollision(3) would output 3
// CarRaceCollision(4) would output 6
// CarRaceCollision(5) would output 10
```

This function works by taking an integer `n` representing the number of cars, and returns the total number of collisions. The calculation for the number of collisions is done using the formula `n*(n-1)/2`, which represents the total number of pairs of cars that can collide.

The reason why this formula works is because each car from one set collides with each car from the other set, and since the cars don't collide with themselves, this gives us the total number of collisions.

This function can be used to predict the number of collisions in a car race scenario.
