    // The answer is n * (n-1) / 2, which is the number of ways of selecting 2 cars
    // from a group of n cars.
    
    return n * (n - 1) / 2
}

// The function works because every car moving in the left direction will collide
// with every car moving in the right direction. Therefore, the number of collisions
// is equivalent to the number of ways to choose two cars out of n + n = n * 2 cars.
// Since the same pair of cars can be selected in more than one way, we divide by 2
// to get the unique pairs.

// Test Case:

func main() {
    fmt.Println(CarRaceCollision(5)) // 10
    fmt.Println(CarRaceCollision(10)) // 45
}

// The test cases work because with n=5, there are 10 unique pairs of cars that
// will collide (5 choose 2), and with n=10, there are 45 unique pairs of cars that
// will collide (10 choose 2).

// This function is a direct application of the formula for the number of ways to
// select 2 items from a group of n items, which is n * (n - 1) / 2.

// The time complexity of this function is O(1), which means it takes constant time
// to execute, regardless of the input size. The space complexity is also O(1),
// meaning it uses a constant amount of space, regardless of the input size.
// This is because the function only performs a single operation, which does not
// depend on the size of the input.

// It is important to note that this function assumes that the input will always be
// a positive integer. If this is not the case, you would need to add error checking
// to ensure that the input is valid.

// The function is named "CarRaceCollision" because it's based on a thought experiment
// where cars are moving in opposite directions on a line. It's also named "CarRace"
// to indicate that it's a simulation of a car race.

// This function is a simple demonstration of how to use Go
