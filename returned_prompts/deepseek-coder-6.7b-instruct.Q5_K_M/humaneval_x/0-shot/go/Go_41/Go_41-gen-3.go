    // The number of collisions is equal to the total number of pairs of cars.
    // For each car, there are n cars that it collides with (cars moving in opposite directions).
    // Therefore, the number of collisions is n * n.
    return n * n
}

// This function is a direct computation of the number of collisions.
// Given n cars moving in opposite directions, the number of collisions is n * n.

// Here, we are assuming that the function will return the correct number of collisions
// for any positive integer input n.

// Therefore, the function is correct as per the problem statement.
