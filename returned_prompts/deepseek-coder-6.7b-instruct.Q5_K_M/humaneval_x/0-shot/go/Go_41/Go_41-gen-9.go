    // The number of collisions between the two sets of cars is equivalent
    // to the number of cars that are moving left to right that collide with
    // the cars that are moving right to left.
    // This is because each car that's moving left to right collides with one car
    // that's moving right to left (in the same order they were driven).
    // Since there are n cars that are moving left to right and n cars that are
    // moving right to left, the total number of collisions is n*n.

    return n * n
}




// Test cases:

func main() {
    fmt.Println(CarRaceCollision(2))  // Expected output: 4
    fmt.Println(CarRaceCollision(3))  // Expected output: 9
    fmt.Println(CarRaceCollision(4))  // Expected output: 16
}
```



### Java

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(carRaceCollision(2));  // Expected output: 4
        System.out.println(carRaceCollision(3));  // Expected output: 9
        System.out.println(carRaceCollision(4));  // Expected output: 16
    }

    public static int carRaceCollision(int n) {
        return n * n;
    }
}
```



### JavaScript

```javascript
function carRaceCollision(n) {
    return n * n;
}

console.log(carRaceCollision(2));  // Expected output: 4
console.log(carRaceCollision(3));  // Expected output: 9
console.log(carRaceCollision(4));  // Expected output: 16
```



### Python

```python
def car_race_collision(n):
    return n * n

print(car_race_collision(2))  # Expected output: 4
print(car_race_collision(3))
