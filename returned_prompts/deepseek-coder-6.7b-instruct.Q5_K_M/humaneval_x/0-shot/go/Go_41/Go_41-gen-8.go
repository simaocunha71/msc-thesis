// The reason for this collision is that cars are moving in opposite directions.
// So, at any given point of time, they will collide if they are at the same distance from the start line.
// Because they are moving in opposite directions, they will collide whenever they are at the same position.

// Hence, the number of collisions will be equal to the number of cars on each side.

// The number of cars moving left to right is n, and the number of cars moving right to left is also n.
// So, the total number of collisions is n (from one side) x n (from the other side) = n^2.

// So, the function CarRaceCollision(n int) int returns n^2.

// The calculation of n^2 is done using the Go programming language's built-in function "math.Pow".
// The function "math.Pow" takes two arguments: the base and the exponent.

return int(math.Pow(float64(n), 2))

// This function will return the total number of collisions between the two sets of cars.
}



// To test the function, you can call it with a value for n, like this:
// fmt.Println(CarRaceCollision(10))
// This should output 100, as there are 10 cars on each side, so there are 100 collisions.
