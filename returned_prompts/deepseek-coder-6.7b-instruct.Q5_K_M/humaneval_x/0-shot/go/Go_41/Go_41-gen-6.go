The solution works by creating two arrays of cars moving in opposite directions. It then iterates over each car in the first array, and for each car, it checks if there is a matching car in the second array. If there is, it means a collision has occurred, so it increments a counter. Finally, it subtracts the number of cars that collide with themselves (which would be n) to get the number of actual collisions.

Time complexity of this solution is O(n^2).

Note: The problem statement is a bit unclear. It says that cars collide if one car hits another. But it also says that cars continue moving as if they did not collide. If that's the case, then we should consider the distance between cars to determine if they will collide. If the distance between cars is
