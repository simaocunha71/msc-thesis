```

## Solution

```go
func Eat(number, need, remaining int) []int {
    if need <= remaining {
        return []int{number + need, remaining - need}
    } else {
        return []int{number + remaining, 0}
    }
}
```

## Explanation

The function `Eat` takes three parameters: the number of carrots that the rabbit has already eaten (`number`), the number of carrots it needs to eat (`need`), and the number of carrots left in stock (`remaining`). 

If the number of carrots needed is less than or equal to the number of remaining carrots, the rabbit will eat all the needed carrots and return the total number of carrots eaten (which is the sum of `number` and `need`), and the number of remaining carrots after the meal. 

If the number of carrots needed is greater than the number of remaining carrots, the rabbit will eat all the remaining carrots, and return the total number of carrots eaten (which is the sum of `number` and `remaining`), and 0 as the number of remaining carrots after the meal.

This solution adheres to the problem constraints and satisfies the problem requirements.

## Testing

```go
fmt.Println(Eat(5, 6, 10))  // Expected output: [11, 4]
fmt.Println(Eat(4, 8, 9))  // Expected output: [12, 1]
fmt.Println(Eat(1, 10, 10))  // Expected output: [11, 0]
fmt.Println(Eat(2, 11, 5))  // Expected output: [7, 0]
```

## Time and Space Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(1) because it performs a fixed number of operations regardless of the size of the input.

The space complexity is also O(1) because it uses a fixed amount of space to store the output.
