A: Here is the solution in Golang:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func Eat(number, need, remaining int) []int {
    if need > remaining {
        number += remaining
        remaining = 0
    } else {
        number += need
        remaining -= need
    }
    return []int{number, remaining}
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(Eat(5, 6, 10))  // [11, 4]
    fmt.Println(Eat(4, 8, 9))  // [12, 1]
    fmt.Println(Eat(1, 10, 10)) // [11, 0]
    fmt.Println(Eat(2, 11, 5))  // [7, 0]
}
```

In the function Eat, we first check if the need is greater than the remaining carrots. If it is, we eat all remaining carrots and return the total number of carrots eaten and 0 remaining. If the need is not greater than the remaining carrots, we eat the need amount and return the total number of carrots eaten and the remaining amount.

In the main function, we test the Eat function with the given examples.

This solution is efficient and should meet the problem constraints.

Hope this helps.


A: Here is a Python solution:

```python
def Eat(number, need, remaining):
    if need > remaining:
        number += remaining
        remaining = 0
    else:
        number += need
        remaining -= need
    return [number, remaining]

print(Eat(5, 6, 10))  # [11, 4]
print(Eat(4, 8, 9))  # [12, 1]
print(Eat(1, 10, 10)) # [11, 0]
print(Eat(2, 11, 5))  # [7, 0]
```

In the function Eat, we
