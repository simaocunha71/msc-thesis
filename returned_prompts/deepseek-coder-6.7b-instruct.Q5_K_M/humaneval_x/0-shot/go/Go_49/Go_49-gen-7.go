The function `Modp` returns 2^n modulo p. The function uses the `math.Pow` function to raise 2 to the power of n, and then takes the modulus of the result with respect to p to get the final answer.

Note: The function `Modp` uses the `math.Pow` function which can return a large number and cause overflow. To avoid this, you can use the `math.Pow` function with `float64` type conversion and then take the modulus of the result with respect to p.

Please note that the question is quite old and the code provided here is written in Golang, which is a modern and efficient language for handling large numbers and complex calculations.

The function `Modp` is taking two integers as input and returning an integer as output. It's calculating the power of 2 with the given number and then finding the modulus with the given number. The modulus operation gives the remainder of the division of the number by the given number.

For example, `Modp(3, 5)` would return 3 because 2 to the power of 3 is 8 and 8 modulo 5 is 3. Similarly, `Modp(1101, 101)` would return 2 because 2 to the power of 1101 is a very large number and finding the modulus of that with 101 would give 2.

Please note that the function `Modp` doesn't handle negative numbers or zero correctly. If you pass a negative number or zero as the first argument, it will return zero which might not be the expected result. You might want to add some error checking or handling code to deal with such cases.

Also, please note that this function uses the `math.Pow` function which can return a very large number and cause overflow. To avoid this, you can use the `math.
