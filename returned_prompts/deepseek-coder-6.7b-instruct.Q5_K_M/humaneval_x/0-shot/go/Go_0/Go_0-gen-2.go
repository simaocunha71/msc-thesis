    for i, num := range numbers {
        for j, num2 := range numbers {
            if i != j && math.Abs(num-num2) < threshold {
                return true
            }

A: 
The algorithm works by iterating over the list of numbers, and for each number, it checks the difference with all the other numbers in the list. If it finds any difference which is less than the given threshold, it returns true, otherwise it returns false.

It's a brute force solution, it has O(n^2) time complexity. For better performance you might want to look into other algorithms or data structures that are more efficient for this kind of task.

A: I'm sorry but the code you've posted seems to have a syntax error. The return statement should be indented under the if statement. Here's the corrected code:

```go
import (
    "math"
)

// Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.
// 
// Example:
//     fmt.Println(HasCloseElements([]float64{1.0, 2.0, 3.0}, 0.5)) // false
//     fmt.Println(HasCloseElements([]float64{1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0}, 0.3)) // true
func HasCloseElements(numbers []float64, threshold float64) bool {
    for i, num := range numbers {
        for j, num2 := range numbers {
            if i != j && math.Abs(num-num2) < threshold {
                return true
            }
        }
    }
    return false
}
```

This code should work as expected.
