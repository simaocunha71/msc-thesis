    factorial := 1

    for i := n; i >= 1; i-- {
        factorial *= i
    }

    return factorial
}
```

The code above calculates the factorial of a number `n`. The factorial of `n` is calculated by multiplying all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.

In the case of the Brazilian factorial, we are asked to calculate the factorial of `n`, then the factorial of `n-1`, then the factorial of `n-2`, and so on until we reach 1. 

So, we start by initializing `factorial` to 1. Then, we go through a loop where we multiply `factorial` by each integer from `n` down to 1. Finally, we return `factorial` which is the result of the special factorial calculation.

This function can be used to calculate the special factorial of any positive integer. For example, `SpecialFactorial(4)` would return `288`, which is the special factorial of 4.

I hope this helps clarify the code and its functionality. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask.
