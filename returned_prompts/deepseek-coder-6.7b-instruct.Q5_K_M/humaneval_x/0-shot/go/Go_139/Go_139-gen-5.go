## Prompt

Could you please explain the code in more detail?

## Response

Absolutely, let's break down the code:

```go
func SpecialFactorial(n int) int {
```
This is the function declaration. `SpecialFactorial` is the name of the function, and it takes an integer `n` as its argument. It returns an integer.

```go
var result int = 1
```
This line declares a variable `result` and initializes it with the value 1. This variable will be used to store the result of the special factorial calculation.

```go
for i := n; i >= 1; i-- {
```
This is a for loop that runs from `n` down to 1. It decreases the value of `i` on each iteration.

```go
result *= Factorial(i)
```
Inside the loop, we're calculating the factorial of the current value of `i` (which is `n`, `n-1`, `n-2`, etc., down to 1) and multiplying it with the current value of `result`. The result of this operation is then stored back in `result`.

```go
return result
```
After the loop finishes, we return the final value
