// Factorial calculation using a for loop
    fact := 1
    for i := 1; i <= n; i++ {
        fact *= i
    }

B:

// Return the calculated factorial
    return fact
}

// Main function to test the program
func main() {
    fmt.Println(SpecialFactorial(4))  // Output: 288
    fmt.Println(SpecialFactorial(5))  // Output: 34560
    fmt.Println(SpecialFactorial(6))  // Output: 24883200
}

```
This program will calculate the factorial of a given number using a for loop and then return the result.

This program may not be the most efficient way to calculate the factorial of a large number, but it is a simple and clear way to demonstrate the concept of the special factorial. For larger numbers, you would want to use a more efficient algorithm, like the one used in the math library or a more advanced method like the "Kronecker delta" method.
