This problem is a little tricky because the factorial of a number is a product of all positive integers less than or equal to that number. So, the solution to this problem involves the application of loop to calculate the product of all numbers from the input number to 1, and recursion to calculate the factorial of each number in the loop.

The Python solution for this problem would look something like this:

```python
def SpecialFactorial(n):
    if n == 1 or n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        factorial = 1
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            factorial *= i
        return factorial * SpecialFactorial(n - 1)
```

This Python function uses recursion to calculate the special factorial. If the input number is 1 or 0, it returns 1. Otherwise, it calculates the factorial of the number and multiplies it by the special factorial of the number minus 1.

The factorial is calculated by initializing a variable to 1 and multiplying it by each number from 1 to the input number. The result is then returned.

The special factorial of 4 is 288 because 4*3*2*1*4*3*2*1 = 288.

package main

import "fmt"

func SpecialFactorial(n int) int {
	if n == 1 || n == 0 {
		return 1
	} else {
		factorial := 1
		for i := 1; i <= n; i++ {
			factorial *= i
		}
		return factorial * SpecialFactorial(n-1)
	}
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(SpecialFactorial(4)) // 288
}
```

This Go code does the same thing as the Python code. It defines a function called `SpecialFactorial` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the special factorial of `n`. The function uses a for loop to calculate the factorial of `n` and a recursive call to calculate the special factorial of `n-1`. The base case
