This code works by iterating over potential factors from 2 up to the square root of the number. It checks if the current number is a factor by checking if the remainder of the division of the number by the potential factor is 0. If it is, it returns a list of the potential factor repeated as many times as it appears in the number's factorization.

If no factors are found, the function returns a list containing the number itself.

Note that the function does not handle negative numbers or zero, as per the problem statement.

Also, this function does not handle non-integer inputs. If you need to support floating-point numbers, you would need to modify the function to accept and handle those inputs appropriately.

This function is not optimized for large inputs. If you need to factorize large numbers, you would need to use a more efficient algorithm, such as Pollard's rho algorithm or a variant of it.

The time complexity of this function is O(sqrt(n)), which is the best possible time complexity for this kind of problem. The space complexity is O(1), because the function uses a fixed amount of space to store the result.

If you need to factorize numbers in a different way, you can modify the function accordingly. For example, you could use a different method for factoring, or you could store the factors in a different data structure.

I hope this helps you understand how to factorize numbers in Go. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask.
