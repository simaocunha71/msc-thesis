The function `Factorize` is a recursive function that factors an integer `n` into its prime factors. It starts by trying to divide `n` by all integers up to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by an integer `i`, it returns the factor `i` along with the factors of `n/i` (which is the remaining factor after dividing `n` by `i`). If `n` is not divisible by any `i`, it returns `n` itself as the prime factor (which means that `n` is a prime number).

In the Python solution, we use a similar approach. We iterate over all integers from 2 to the square root of `n`, and for each integer `i`, we check if `n` is divisible by `i`. If `n` is divisible by `i`, we return a list that consists of `i` and the factors of `n/i`. If `n` is not divisible by any `i`, we return a list that consists of `n` itself.

Here is the Python solution:

```python
import math

def factorize(n):
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return [i] + factorize(n // i)
    return [n]
```

Both solutions have a time complexity of O(sqrt(n)) because in the worst case they iterate over all integers up to the square root of `n`. The space complexity is also O(sqrt(n)) due to the recursion stack in the case where `n` is a prime number.

Please note that the Python solution is different from the Go solution. The Go solution returns the factors in ascending order, while the Python solution returns the factors in the order they appear in the prime factorization.

Also, the Go solution does not return the factors in asc
