// Factorize the given number n into prime factors
// For each factor, append it to the list factors
// Then divide n by the same factor to get a new number to factorize
// Repeat this process until n is reduced to 1
// At the end, factors should contain all prime factors of n, in the order from smallest to largest

B:
// For each number i from 2 to the square root of n
// If n is divisible by i (i.e., n % i == 0), then i is a factor of n
// Append i to the list factors
// Divide n by i to get a new number to factorize
// Go back to B to continue the process until n is reduced to 1
// If n is not 1 after the loop, then n is a prime factor of itself, and append it to the list factors
// Return the list factors

The code you provided is a Go function that factorizes a number into its prime factors. It uses the method of repeatedly dividing the number by its smallest prime factor until it is reduced to 1. The result is a list of the prime factors in ascending order. The function uses a loop to iterate over potential factors, from 2 up to the square root of the number, checking for divisibility. If a factor is found, it is appended to the list of factors and the number is divided by that factor. The process continues until the number is reduced to 1. If the number is still greater than 1 at the end, it is a prime factor of itself and is appended to the list of factors. The function returns the list of factors.
