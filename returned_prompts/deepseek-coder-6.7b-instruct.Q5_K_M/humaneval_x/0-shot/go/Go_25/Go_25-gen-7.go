    for p := 2; p*p <= n; p++ {
        if n%p == 0 {
            var factors []int
            for n%p == 0 {
                factors = append(factors, p)
                n /= p
            }
            return factors
        }
    }
    return []int{n}
}

This code is incorrect because it does not return all factors. It only returns one factor and its multiplicity.

You can fix it by iterating over all possible factors (from 2 to sqrt(n)) and appending them to the result slice if they divide n. If they do, divide n by this factor and continue the process until n becomes 1.

Also, the function should return the slice of factors sorted in ascending order.

Here is the correct code:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sort"
	"math"
)

func Factorize(n int) []int {
	var factors []int
	for p := 2; p*p <= n; p++ {
		for n%p == 0 {
			factors = append(factors, p)
			n /= p
		}
	}
	if n > 1 {
		factors = append(factors, n)
	}
	sort.Ints(factors)
	return factors
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(Factorize(8))
	fmt.Println(Factorize(25))
	fmt.Println(Factorize(70))
}
```

This code will output:

```
[2, 2, 2]
[5, 5]
[2, 5, 7]
```

which are the prime factors of 8, 25, and 70, in
