This code does not work correctly. If n is greater than 1, it should return 2^(n-1) because each n-digit number starting or ending with 1 has a 2^(n-1) possibility. But the code returns 2^n. The problem lies in the B part of the code where math.Pow(2, float64(n-1)) is used. This is because it is using n-1 as the exponent, but it should be using n-1 as the base.
