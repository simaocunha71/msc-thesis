    if n == 1{
        return 1
    }

B:
    return int(math.Pow(2, float64(n-1)))
}

This code works, but I'm not sure about the logic behind it. Could you explain it to me?

A: This code calculates the count of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1.

B: 
The count of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1 is simply 2^(n-1). This is because for each n-digit number that starts or ends with 1, there are two options: whether to start with 1 or end with 1. For each of these two options, there are 2^(n-1) possibilities for the rest of the digits.

For example, for n=2, there are 2^1=2 two-digit numbers that start or end with 1: 1x, x1. For n=3, there are 2^2=4 four-digit numbers that start or end with 1: 1xx, x1x, xx1, xxx.

A: 
The base case of the recursive function is when n equals 1. In this case, there is only one n-digit positive integer that starts or ends with 1, which is 1 itself. This is the base case of the recursive function because it does not make use of the recursive call.

In summary, this code calculates the count of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1 by using the formula 2^(n-1).
