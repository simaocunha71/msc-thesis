	if n <= 0 {
		return 0
	}
	if n == 1 {
		return 1
	}

	return Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2)

}

func main() {

	fmt.Println(Fib(10))
	fmt.Println(Fib(1))
	fmt.Println(Fib(8))

}

```

The problem with the above code is that it has a time complexity of O(2^n). This is because the function Fib calls itself twice in every iteration.

To reduce the time complexity to O(n), we can use dynamic programming by storing the computed values in an array.

Here is the improved code:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func Fib(n int) int {

	F := make([]int, n+1)
	F[0] = 0
	F[1] = 1

	for i := 2; i <= n; i++ {
		F[i] = F[i-1] + F[i-2]
	}

	return F[n]

}

func main() {

	fmt.Println(Fib(10))
	fmt.Println(Fib(1))
	fmt.Println(Fib(8))

}
```

In this code, we initialize an array F of size n+1 with F[0] = 0 and F[1] = 1. Then we fill the rest of the array in a loop from F[2] to F[n] by adding the previous two numbers in the array. Finally, we return F[n]. This solution has a time complexity of O(n).

Also, note that this solution uses a little more memory than the recursive solution, as it needs to store the entire array of size n.

This solution is adapted from the standard dynamic programming solution to the Fibonacci sequence problem.

Note: The above solution assumes that the input number n is a non-negative integer. If n can be negative or a floating point number, additional error checking needs to be implemented.

```go
package main

import "fmt"
import "errors"
