    var result []int
    m := make(map[int]bool)

B:
    if n % 2 != 0 && !m[n] {
        result = append(result, n)
        m[n] = true
    }

C:
    if n == 1 {
        sort.Ints(result)
        return result
    }

D:
    if n % 2 == 0 {
        n = n / 2
    } else {
        n = 3 * n + 1
    }
    goto B
}

I have tried running this code but it seems to have an infinite loop. Can anyone help me to figure out why?

A: The code is expected to have an infinite loop because it does not satisfy the condition to stop the execution. You are appending the number to the result only if it is odd and it has not been encountered before. But the condition to stop the loop is when n becomes 1, not when n becomes 1.

You should change the condition to stop the loop to when n is 1, and sort the result before returning.

Here is the corrected code:

```go
import (
    "sort"
)

func GetOddCollatz(n int) []int {
    var result []int
    m := make(map[int]bool)

    for {
        if n % 2 != 0 && !m[n] {
            result = append(result, n)
            m[n] = true
        }

        if n == 1 {
            break
        }

        if n % 2 == 0 {
            n = n / 2
        } else {
            n = 3 * n + 1
        }
    }

    sort.Ints(result)
    return result
}
```

This code will work as expected. It will generate the Collatz sequence starting from n, and append all odd numbers to the result. It will stop when n becomes 1 and return the sorted result.

The loop will continue until n becomes 1, and it will break the loop when n is 1. The loop is guaranteed to terminate because the Collatz sequence will eventually reach 1.
