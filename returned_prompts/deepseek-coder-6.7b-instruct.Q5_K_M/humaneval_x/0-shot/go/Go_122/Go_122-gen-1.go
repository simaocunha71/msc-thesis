    sum := 0
    for i := 0; i < k; i++ {
        if len(strconv.Itoa(arr[i])) <= 2 {
            sum += arr[i]
        }
    }
    return sum
}
```

- The code is written in Go language. It takes an array of integers `arr` and an integer `k` as input and returns the sum of the elements with at most two digits from the first `k` elements of the array.
- The `AddElements` function works by iterating over the first `k` elements of the array `arr`. For each element, it converts it to a string using `strconv.Itoa` and then checks the length of the resulting string. If the length is less than or equal to 2, it adds the element to the sum.
- Finally, it returns the sum.

#### Time complexity:
- The time complexity of the code is O(n), where n is the value of `k`. This is because the code needs to iterate over the first `k` elements of the array.

#### Space complexity:
- The space complexity of the code is O(1), as it uses a constant amount of space to store the sum and the elements of the array.

#### Test cases:
```
func main() {
    fmt.Println(AddElements([]int{111,21,3,4000,5,6,7,8,9}, 4)) // Output: 24
    fmt.Println(AddElements([]int{10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90}, 3)) // Output: 60
}
```

### Python Solution:

```python
def add_elements(arr, k):
    return sum(x for x in arr[:k] if len(str(x)) <= 2)

print(add_elements([111,21,3,4000,5,6,7,8,9], 4))  # Output: 24
print(add_elements([10,20,30,40,50,60,70,8
