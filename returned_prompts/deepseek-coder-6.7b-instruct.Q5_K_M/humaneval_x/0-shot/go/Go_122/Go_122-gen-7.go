    sum := 0

B:
    for i := 0; i < k; i++ {
        if len(strconv.Itoa(arr[i])) <= 2 {
            sum += arr[i]
        }
    }

    return sum
}

```

This program will sum up the elements of an array with a maximum of two digits from the first k elements of the array.
The program uses a simple for loop to iterate over the first k elements of the array and checks the number of digits in each element using the strconv.Itoa() function. If the number of digits is 2 or less, the element is added to the sum.
The sum is then returned.

The time complexity of this program is O(k), where k is the number of elements to sum up. The space complexity is O(1), as no additional space is used that scales with the input size.

This program can be used to solve the problem at hand.

```

```python
# Python Solution

def addElements(arr, k):
    return sum(x for x in arr[:k] if len(str(x)) <= 2)

# Test
arr = [111,21,3,4000,5,6,7,8,9]
k = 4
print(addElements(arr, k))  # Output: 24
```

This Python program does the same thing as the Go program. It sums up the elements of an array with a maximum of two digits from the first k elements of the array.
The program uses a list comprehension to generate a list of elements with a maximum of two digits from the first k elements of the array and then sums up this list.
The sum is then returned.

The time complexity of this program is O(k), where k is the number of elements to sum up. The space complexity is O(k), as a list of k elements is created.

This program can be used to solve the problem at hand.

```cpp
// C++ Solution

#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

int addElements(std::vector<int>& arr, int k) {
    int sum =
