    sum := 0

B:
    for i := 0; i < k; i++ {
        if len(strconv.Itoa(arr[i])) <= 2 {
            sum += arr[i]
        }
    }
    return sum
}

I tried to write the code as per the problem statement but it does not work. I have tried multiple ways but no luck. 

A: The problem is that you're not getting the correct answer. 

The correct answer for the given example [111,21,3,4000,5,6,7,8,9] and k=4 is 24, but your function returns 0. 

Your loop doesn't work because you're trying to convert a number into a string and then check its length, but the function strconv.Itoa(arr[i]) returns a string representation of the integer, not the number of digits.

Here's the corrected version of your function:

```go
func AddElements(arr []int, k int) int {
    sum := 0
    for i := 0; i < k; i++ {
        if arr[i] >= 0 && arr[i] <= 99 {
            sum += arr[i]
        }
    }
    return sum
}
```

This function works by checking if each number in the first k elements of arr is between 0 and 99 (inclusive). If it is, the function adds it to the sum.

Also, please note that your constraints say "1 <= len(arr) <= 100" and "1 <= k <= len(arr)", but your function does not check if these conditions are met. If you want your function to check these conditions, you can add error handling code to do so.

```go
func AddElements(arr []int, k int) (int, error) {
    if len(arr) < 1 || len(arr) > 100 {
        return 0, errors.New("arr length should be between 1 and 100")
    }
    if k < 1 || k > len(arr) {
        return 0, errors.New("k should be between 1 and length of
