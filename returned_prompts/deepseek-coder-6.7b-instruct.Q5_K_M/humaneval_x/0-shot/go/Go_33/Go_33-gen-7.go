    sort.Ints(l)
    var l_prime []int

    for i := 0; i < len(l); i++ {
        if (i+1)%3 == 0 {
            l_prime = append(l_prime, l[i])
        } else {
            l_prime = append(l_prime, l[i])
        }
    }

    return l_prime
}

In the code above, I first sort the list l, then I iterate through l. If the index is divisible by three, I append the sorted value at that index to l_prime. If the index is not divisible by three, I append the value at that index to l_prime. Finally, I return l_prime.

This solution is not correct because the condition (i+1)%3 == 0 is wrong. It should be i%3 == 0. The reason is that we want to check if the index is divisible by three, not the index plus one.

Here is the correct code:

```go
