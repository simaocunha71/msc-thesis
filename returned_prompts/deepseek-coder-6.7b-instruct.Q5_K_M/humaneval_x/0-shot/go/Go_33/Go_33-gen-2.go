    sort.Ints(l)
    for i, v := range l {
        if i%3 == 0 {
            l[i] = v
        }
    }
    return l
}

I got this error:

panic: runtime error: index out of range

I know that the error is because of the line `if i%3 == 0 { l[i] = v }` which tries to access `l[i]` when `i` is not a valid index of `l`. However, I'm not sure how to fix this.


A: The issue is in the range loop: you are updating the slice (l) during the iteration. This is causing the indices to be incorrect. To fix it, you need to make a copy of the slice and iterate over the copy.

Here's the corrected code:

```go
func SortThird(l []int) []int {
    sorted := make([]int, len(l))
    copy(sorted, l)
    sort.Ints(sorted)
    for i := 0; i < len(l); i++ {
        if i%3 == 0 {
            l[i] = sorted[i]
        }
    }
    return l
}
```

In the above code, we first make a copy of the slice (l) and call it sorted. We then sort the sorted slice. After that, we iterate over the original slice (l), and if the index is divisible by three, we replace the value at that index in the original slice (l) with the corresponding value in the sorted slice. Finally, we return the original slice (l).

This way, we avoid the issue of modifying the slice during iteration.

Also note that the output of the function is the original slice (l), but with some of its values replaced by the sorted values at the indices divisible by three.

I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any further questions.
