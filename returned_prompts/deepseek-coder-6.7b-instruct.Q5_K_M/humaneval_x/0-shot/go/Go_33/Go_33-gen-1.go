It seems like you've got it. You've correctly identified the indices that are divisible by three, sorted those values, and then reinserted them back into the list.

Here is your function in a format that is more easily readable:

```go
func SortThird(l []int) []int {
    s := make([]int, 0, len(l))

    // Identify the values at indices divisible by three
    for i, v := range l {
        if (i+1)%3 == 0 {
            s = append(s, v)
        }
    }

    // Sort the identified values
    sort.Ints(s)

    // Replace the values at indices divisible by three with the sorted values
    j := 0
    for i, v := range l {
        if (i+1)%3 == 0 {
            l[i] = s[j]
            j++
        } else {
            l[i] = v
        }
    }

    return l
}
```

This function works by first creating a new slice with the values at the indices divisible by three. It then sorts this slice, and replaces the original values at these indices with the sorted values. The result is a list where the values at the indices divisible by three are sorted, and the other values remain unchanged.

Overall, your implementation is correct and should work as expected.
