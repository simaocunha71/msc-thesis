Your code seems to have a logic error. The line l_prime[i] = l[i] is overwriting the value at index i in l_prime. You probably want to copy the value from l to l_prime at index i, so that l_prime is a sorted version of l, but only at the indices where i%3 == 0.

Here's a corrected version of your code:

```go
func SortThird(l []int) []int {
    // Create a copy of l
    l_prime := append([]int(nil), l...)

    // Sort l_prime
    sort.Ints(l_prime)

    // Iterate over l
    for i := range l {
        // If i is divisible by 3, replace the value at l_prime[i] with the sorted value
        if i%3 == 0 {
            l_prime[i] = l_prime[i]
        }
    }

    return l_prime
}
```

This code first creates a copy of the input list l, so that we don't mutate the original list. It then sorts the copy, l_prime, and iterates over the original list, l. If the index is divisible by 3, it replaces the value at l_prime
