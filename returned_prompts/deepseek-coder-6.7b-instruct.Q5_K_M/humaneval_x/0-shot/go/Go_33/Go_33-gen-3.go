    // Create a copy of the input list to preserve the original order
    copyL := make([]int, len(l))
    copy(copyL, l)

    // Sort the copy of the list
    sort.Ints(copyL)

    // Iterate through the original list and replace the elements at indices that are divisible by three with the corresponding sorted value
    for i := range l {
        if i % 3 == 0 {
            l[i] = copyL[i]
        }
    }

    return l
}

This solution works by first creating a sorted copy of the input list. It then iterates through the original list and replaces the elements at indices that are divisible by three with the corresponding value from the sorted copy. The original order of the elements is preserved in this process.

Please note that the indices that are divisible by three are not the indices that are divisible by three in the sorted list. The indices in the sorted list are the ones that are divisible by three.
