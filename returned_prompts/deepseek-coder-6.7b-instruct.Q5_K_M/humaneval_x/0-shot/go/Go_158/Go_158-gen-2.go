A: This program takes in a list of words, sorts them in lexicographical order, and then iterates through the list to find the word with the most unique characters. 

The function 'uniqueCharacters' counts the number of unique characters in a string and returns a map with these characters. 

B: In the function 'FindMax', it uses the 'uniqueCharacters' function to count the number of unique characters in each word. If the count of unique characters in the current word is greater than the current maximum count, it updates the maximum count and the word with the maximum count. 

In the end, it returns the word with the maximum count of unique characters.

It does not handle the case where all words have the same number of unique characters, as specified in the problem.

I believe there's an error in the question, because the program returns the first word with the maximum number of unique characters, not the word that comes first in lexicographical order.

Here's the corrected program:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sort"
)

func FindMax(words []string) string {
	sort.Strings(words)
	maxCount := 0
	maxWord := ""

	for _, word := range words {
		count := len(uniqueCharacters(word))
		if count > maxCount {
			maxCount = count
			maxWord = word
		}
