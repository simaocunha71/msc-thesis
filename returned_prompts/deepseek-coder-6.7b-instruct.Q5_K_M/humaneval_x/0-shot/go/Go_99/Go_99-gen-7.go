    f, err := strconv.ParseFloat(value, 64)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
    }

    return int(f + 0.5)
}
```

This function takes a string as input and converts it to a float64. It then rounds the float64 by adding 0.5 before converting it to an integer. The reason for adding 0.5 before converting to an integer is that it will round the float to the nearest integer, but it will round away from zero if the float is equidistant between two integers.

Note: This solution assumes that the input string is a valid number. If the input string is not a valid number, the function will return 0.

Also, this solution assumes that the input string represents a whole number. If the input string represents a decimal number, the function will round the decimal to the nearest integer.

Finally, this solution assumes that the input string represents a positive number. If the input string represents a negative number, the function will round the negative number to the nearest integer.

This solution uses the `strconv` package to convert the string to a float64, and uses the `fmt` package to print an error message if the string is not a valid number.

This solution is written in Go.

This solution is not optimal in terms of time complexity. It has a time complexity of O(1), which means that it always takes the same amount of time to execute, regardless of the size of the input. This is because it only does a single operation: it converts the string to a float64, adds 0.5, and converts the result to an integer.

This solution is also not optimal in terms of space complexity. It has a space complexity of O(1), which means that it always uses the same amount of space, regardless of the size of the input. This is because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the float64, the integer, and the error.

This solution is correct and efficient.

This solution is a good example of how to use the `strconv` package in Go to convert a string to a float64, and how to use the `fmt` package to print an error message if the string is not a valid number. It also shows how to
