    f, err := strconv.ParseFloat(value, 64)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

B:
    return int(math.Round(f))
}

I'd like to know if there is a way to solve this problem using only integers and no floating point numbers or any other data types.

A: Here is a solution that uses only integers and the math package. This solution first converts the input string to an integer, then determines if the input string represents a negative number. Finally, it rounds the input string to the nearest integer using integer division and modulus operations.

```go
import "math"

func ClosestInteger(value string) int {
    sign := 1
    if value[0] == '-' {
        sign = -1
        value = value[1:]
    }

    num, _ := strconv.Atoi(value)
    rounded := num / 2 * 2

    if num % 2 != 0 && sign == 1 {
        rounded += sign * 1
    } else if num % 2 != 0 && sign == -1 {
        rounded += sign * 1
    }

    return rounded
}
```

This solution works by rounding the number to the nearest even integer. If the number is not even, it adds 1 to make it the next highest even integer. If the number is negative, it negates the result.

This solution assumes that the input string is always a valid integer or a negative integer. If the input string can be invalid, additional error checking should be added.

Please note that this solution only works for positive numbers and negative numbers where the integer part of the number is even. For example, "-15.5" will not be correctly rounded. The math.Round function used in your original solution handles these edge cases.

Also, this solution uses the strconv.Atoi function to convert the string to an integer, which will panic if the string cannot be converted to an integer. This function is safe to use in this context because we know that the input string is guaranteed to be a valid integer.

If you want to use this solution, you should replace the math.Round function in your original solution with
