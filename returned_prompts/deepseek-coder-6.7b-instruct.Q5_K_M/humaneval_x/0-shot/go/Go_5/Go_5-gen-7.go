    result := make([]int, 0, len(numbers)*2)
    for i, number := range numbers {
        result = append(result, number)
        if i < len(numbers)-1 {
            result = append(result, delimeter)
        }
    }
    return result
}
```

Here is a simple Go program that uses the above function:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println(Intersperse([]int{}, 4))        // []
    fmt.Println(Intersperse([]int{1, 2, 3}, 4)) // [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]
}
```

This function works by creating a new slice with enough capacity to hold all the elements of the original slice plus the delimeter. It then iterates over the original slice, appending each element to the new slice, and then the delimeter. If the current element is the last one in the original slice, it does not append a delimeter after it.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input slice, because it iterates over the slice once. The space complexity is also O(n), because it creates a new slice to hold all the elements of the original slice plus the delimeter.

Please note that this function does not modify the original slice, as per the Go language's guidelines for passing arguments by value.

Also note that the Go language does not have a built-in way to intersperse a value between elements of a slice, so this function is a common way to do it.
