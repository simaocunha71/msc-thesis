This function works by converting the integer to a string, and then shifting the digits accordingly. If the shift is greater than the number of digits in the string, the function will reverse the string. Otherwise, it will shift the digits right by the specified amount. The digits are shifted by taking a substring of the end of the string, and concatenating it with the start of the string.

The Reverse function is used to reverse a string. It does this by converting the string to a slice of runes (which are the individual characters in Go), and then swapping the characters at the start and end of the slice, and repeating this process until the whole string has been reversed. Finally, the reversed string is returned.

This function is then used in the main function to test the CircularShift function with the given inputs. The outputs of these tests are compared to the expected outputs, and if they match, the test passes. Otherwise, the test fails.

The main function also includes a call to the CircularShift function with a different input to test the function. The output of this call is printed to the console.

This program should compile and run without error. If you run it, it will print "21" to the console.
