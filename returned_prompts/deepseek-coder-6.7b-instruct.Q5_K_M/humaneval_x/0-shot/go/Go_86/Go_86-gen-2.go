            return sorted[i] < sorted[j]

This code works by first splitting the input string into a slice of words. It then sorts each word (converted to a slice of runes for Unicode compatibility), and replaces the original word in the slice with the sorted word. Finally, it joins the slice back into a string with blank spaces in between words.

The time complexity of this code is O(n log n) because of the sorting operation, where n is the length of the string.

The space complexity of this code is O(n) because we're creating a new slice of words to store the sorted words.

It's important to note that this code assumes that all the characters in the string are lowercase. If the string contains uppercase characters, they will be sorted before the lowercase characters in the ASCII table. If you want to sort all characters regardless of case, you can modify the sorting function to ignore case when comparing the characters.

Also, this code assumes that words are separated by one or more spaces. If there are multiple spaces between words, they will be treated as one. If you want to handle multiple spaces, you can modify the code to split the string on whitespace characters, not just spaces.

This code also assumes that words are made up of alphanumeric characters and that punctuation is included in the string. If you want to handle other types of characters, you can modify the code to ignore them.

This code also assumes that the string doesn't contain any special characters that have a lower ASCII value. If you want to handle special characters, you can modify the code to sort them after the letters and numbers.

This code also assumes that the string doesn't contain any non-ASCII characters. If you want to handle non-ASCII characters, you can modify the code to sort them based on their Unicode code points.

This code also assumes that the string doesn't contain any words that are the
