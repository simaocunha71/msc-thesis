I'm not sure what to do to solve the problem. I'm thinking of splitting the sentence into words, sorting them, then reassembling the sentence but I'm not sure how to implement that in Golang.

A: Here's a possible solution:

```go
import (
    "sort"
    "strings"
)

func AntiShuffle(s string) string {
    words := strings.Fields(s)
    for i, word := range words {
        chars := []rune(word)
        sort.Slice(chars, func(i, j int) bool {
            return chars[i] < chars[j]
        })
        words[i] = string(chars)
    }
    return strings.Join(words, " ")
}
```

This function works by first splitting the input string into words using the `strings.Fields` function. It then iterates over each word, converts it to a slice of runes (which can handle any Unicode character), sorts the runes using the `sort.Slice` function, and converts the sorted runes back to a string.

Finally, it joins the sorted words back together into a single string with spaces between words using the `strings.Join` function.

Note that this function sorts the characters in each word in ascending order based on their Unicode code points, not ASCII values. This should give you the desired result for most common characters, but it may not work correctly for characters outside the basic multilingual plane (those with Unicode code points above 127).

Also, please note that this solution assumes that the input string is correctly formatted and that all words in it are separated by a single space. If the input string might have multiple consecutive spaces between words, you would need to handle this case separately.

```
