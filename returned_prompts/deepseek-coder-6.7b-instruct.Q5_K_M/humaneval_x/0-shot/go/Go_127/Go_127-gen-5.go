    // Determine the length of Intersection
    start := max(interval1[0], interval2[0])
    end := min(interval1[1], interval2[1])
    length := end - start + 1

B:

    // If the length of Intersection is less than 2, return "NO"
    if length < 2 {
        return "NO"
    }

C:

    // Determine if the length of Intersection is a prime number
    for i := 2; i * i <= length; i++ {
        if length % i == 0 {
            return "NO"
        }
    }
    return "YES"
}

func max(a, b int) int {
    if a > b {
        return a
    }
    return b
}

func min(a, b int) int {
    if a < b {
        return a
    }
    return b
}

```

**Explanation:**

This solution first finds the start and end of the intersection by finding the maximum start and minimum end. The length of the intersection is calculated as end - start + 1. If the length is less than 2, "NO" is returned. Then it checks if the length is a prime number.

**Complexity Analysis:**

- Time Complexity: O(sqrt(n)), where n is the length of the intersection. The loop runs until the square root of the length.
- Space Complexity: O(1), constant space is used.

**Test Cases:**

- Intersection((1, 2), (2, 3)) => "NO"
- Intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4)) => "NO"
- Intersection((-3, -1), (-5, 5)) => "YES"
- Intersection((5, 10), (8, 12)) => "YES"
- Intersection((3, 5), (4, 6)) => "NO"
- Intersection((1, 3), (2, 4)) => "NO"
- Intersection((1, 2), (2, 2)) => "NO"
