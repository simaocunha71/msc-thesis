A: The function Simplify checks whether the cross-multiplication of the fractions x and n results in a whole number. It does this by converting the cross-multiplication result to a fraction, and checking if the denominator of this fraction is 1 (i.e., the fraction is a whole number).

B: The function splitFraction splits a string representation of a fraction into its numerator and denominator. It does this by splitting the string on the "/" character, and converting the resulting numeric strings to integers.

C: The function simplify uses these two functions to simplify the expression x * n. It first splits the fractions x and n into their numerators and denominators, then cross-multiplies the numerators, and finally cross-multiplies the denominators. It then checks if the cross-multiplication result is a whole number by converting the result to a fraction and checking if the denominator is 1. If it is, the function returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

D: The function splitFraction uses these two functions to simplify the expression x * n. It first splits the fractions x and n into their numerators and denominators, then cross-multiplies the numerators, and finally cross-multiplies the denominators. It then checks if the cross-multiplication result is a whole number by converting the result to a fraction and checking if the denominator is 1. If it is, the
