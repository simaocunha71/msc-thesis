A: The logic seems fine, however, it's not efficient to split the string twice. We can use a single split to get both numbers.

Here's the improved code:

```go
import (
    "strconv"
    "strings"
)

func Simplify(x, n string) bool {
    xParts := strings.Split(x, "/")
    nParts := strings.Split(n, "/")

    x1, _ := strconv.Atoi(xParts[0])
    x2, _ := strconv.Atoi(xParts[1])
    n1, _ := strconv.Atoi(nParts[0])
    n2, _ := strconv.Atoi(nParts[1])

    result := float64(x1*n1) / float64(x2*n2)

    return result == float64(int(result))
}
```

In this version, we've split the strings only once, and have used the results of the split to convert the numbers. This should be more efficient.

The code also simplifies by returning the result of the comparison directly, as this is the final value that gets returned by the function.

Remember that in Go, if you don't handle errors correctly, the program may panic. In this case, we
