This function checks if the string is empty and if the last character is an alphabetical character. If the string is empty or the last character is not an alphabetical character, the function returns false.

B:
If the string is not empty and the last character is an alphabetical character, the function checks if the previous character is not an alphabetical character (which means it's not a part of a word).

C:
If the string is of length 1 (i.e., the string only contains one character), the function returns true, since there is no previous character to check.

D:
If the previous character is not an alphabetical character, the function returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

This function assumes that a word is defined as a group of characters separated by spaces. It checks if the previous character is not an alphabetical character to determine if the last character is a part of a word.

Please note that this function has a complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because it iterates over the string once to check if the last character is an alphabetical character and once to check if the previous character is not an alphabetical character. This could be improved to O(1) by keeping track of the previous character during the iteration over the string. However, this would require additional memory to store the previous character.
