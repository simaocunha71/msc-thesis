// We can use a simple loop to iterate through the numbers up to n and calculate the Fib4 sequence.
// We can use a list to store the last 4 numbers in the sequence as we calculate each one.
// We then return the last number in the list as our result.

// Here is the Python code to solve the problem:

// Python Code

package main

import "fmt"

func Fib4(n int) int  {
    if n < 4 {
        return n == 3
    }

    a, b, c, d := 0, 0, 2, 0
    for i := 4; i <= n; i++ {
        a, b, c, d = b, c, d, a+b+c+d
    return d
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(Fib4(5)) // Output: 4
    fmt.Println(Fib4(6)) // Output: 8
    fmt.Println(Fib4(7)) // Output: 14
}

// This Python program works by initializing the first 4 numbers in the Fib4 sequence (0, 0, 2, 0) and then using a loop to calculate each subsequent number in the sequence.
// It then returns the last number in the sequence as the result.
// The time complexity of this program is O(n) as it performs a single loop from 4 to n.
// The space complexity is O(1) as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the last 4 numbers in the sequence.

// This program can be optimized by using matrix exponentiation for the Fib4 sequence, but that is beyond the scope of this question.

// Note: The Fib4 sequence is a generalization of the Fibonacci sequence and the Fibonacci sequence itself. 
// The Fib4 sequence is defined by the rule Fib4(n) = Fib4(n-1) + Fib4(n-2) + Fib4(n-3) + Fib4(n-4) with initial conditions Fib4(0)=0, Fib4(1)=0, Fib4(2)=2
