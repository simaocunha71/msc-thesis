**Note:** This solution is implemented in Golang.

**Explanation:** 

The function `Fib4(n int) int` is calculating nth Fib4 number. The base cases for `n` are if `n` is less than 0, it will return -1. If `n` is less than or equal to 3, it will return `n % 2`. 

The `fib` slice is created to store the Fib4 sequence till the given `n`. Initially, the first 4 elements of the sequence are set as per the given base cases. 

Then a loop is run from 4 to `n`, where in each iteration, the next element of the Fib4 sequence is calculated as the sum of the previous 4 elements. 

Finally, the `nth` element of the Fib4 sequence is returned.

**Time Complexity:** O(n)

**Space Complexity:** O(n)

**Test Cases:** 

```
fmt.Println(Fib4(5)) // 4
fmt.Println(Fib4(6)) // 8
fmt.Println(Fib4(7)) // 14
```

**Constraints:** 

- The input will always be a positive integer.
- The function will not be called with a value that is too large. 

**Note:** The problem statement might be incorrect or the question is not clear. The Fib4 sequence is not the standard Fibonacci sequence. The given sequence is
