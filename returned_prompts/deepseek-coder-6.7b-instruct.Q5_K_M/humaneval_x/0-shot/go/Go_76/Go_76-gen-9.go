    if x == 1{
        return true
    }
    if n <= 1 {
        return false
    }
    for i := 2; i <= x; i++ {
        if math.Pow(float64(n), float64(i)) == float64(x) {

The function works by iterating over the integers i from 2 upwards, and checking if n^i equals x. If it does, then it returns true (i.e., x is a simple power of n). If it doesn't find such an i, it returns false (i.e., x is not a simple power of n).

Please note that this function is not very efficient for large inputs, as it iterates up to x times. It may be more efficient to use a binary search instead.

Additionally, the function does not handle the case where n = 1 correctly, as it should return true for x = 1, and false for x > 1.

You can improve the efficiency of the function by using a binary search. However, the function does not handle the case where n = 1 correctly, as it should return true for x = 1, and false for x > 1.

Here's the improved function:

```go
func IsSimplePower(x int, n int) bool {
    if n == 1 {
        return x == 1
    }
    if x < 1 {
        return false
    }
    lo, hi := 0, x
    for lo <= hi {
        mid := (lo + hi) / 2
        pow := int(math.Pow(float64(n), float64(mid)))
        if pow == x {
            return true
        } else if pow < x {
            lo = mid + 1
        } else {
            hi = mid - 1
        }
    }
    return false
}
```

This function works by first checking if n = 1, in which case it returns true if x = 1 and false otherwise. It then checks if x is negative, in which case it returns false. Finally, it performs a binary search for the power of n that equals x. If it finds such a power
