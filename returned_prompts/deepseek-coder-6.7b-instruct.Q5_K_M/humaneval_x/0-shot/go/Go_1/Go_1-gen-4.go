The function works by iterating over the input string. It keeps track of the groups in the form of a stack. When it encounters an opening parenthesis, it pushes it onto the stack and starts a new group. When it encounters a closing parenthesis, it pops from the stack and adds the parenthesis to the current group. If the stack is empty, this indicates the end of a group, so the current group is added to the result list and a new group is started.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because it iterates over the string once. The space complexity is also O(n) because in the worst case, the stack and result list will contain n/2 elements.

Please note that this function assumes that the input string is correctly formatted and does not contain any characters other than parentheses. If this is not the case, you will need to add error checking to handle these cases.

I hope this helps, and let me know if you have any other questions about this function.
