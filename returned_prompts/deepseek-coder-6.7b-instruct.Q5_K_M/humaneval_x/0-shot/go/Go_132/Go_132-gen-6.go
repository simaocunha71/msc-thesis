This script uses a list to store the positions of the opening brackets in the string. After that, it checks if there is a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket in the subsequence is nested.

The script returns `true` if there is at least one valid nested bracket sequence and `false` otherwise.

The complexity of this solution is `O(n)`, as we traverse the input string once to find the positions of the opening brackets, and once more to check for nested brackets.

The space complexity is also `O(n)`, as we store the positions of the opening brackets in a list.

The test cases are based on the examples given in the problem description.

## Reflection

This problem was a good exercise in understanding the concept of nested brackets and how to solve it using a stack-like data structure. The solution was implemented in Go, a statically typed, compiled language. It was a good reminder
