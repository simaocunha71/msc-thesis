This solution uses a stack to keep track of the open brackets and checks if there is a valid nested bracket sequence. If there is a mismatch, it returns false immediately.

If there are still open brackets at the end of the string, it also returns false, because those brackets are not properly closed.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n) where n is the length of the string.

This solution is based on the idea that a valid nested bracket sequence must be a subset of the original bracket sequence, so we can use a stack to keep track of the open brackets.

In the end, if there is any open bracket left in the stack, it means that there is a bracket that is not properly closed, so we return false. If there are no open brackets left in the stack, it means that all brackets are properly closed, so we return true.

In the solution, we iterate over the string and for each character, we check if it is an open bracket or a close bracket. If it is an open bracket, we push it to the stack. If it is a close bracket, we check if the stack is empty or the last element of the stack is not an open bracket. If either of these conditions is true, we return false because there is an invalid subsequ
