#### Solution Explanation:
First, we initialize an empty string `res`.
Then we iterate over each character in the string `s`. If the character is not found in `c`, we append it to `res`.
After that, we initialize another empty string `rev`. Then we iterate over each character in the string `res`. For each character, we add it at the beginning of `rev`.
Finally, we return a tuple containing `res` and a boolean indicating whether `res` is a palindrome (`res` is equal to its reverse `rev`).

In Go, we can use the `strings.ContainsRune` function to check if a rune (character) is in a string.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`.
The space complexity is O(n), because we are storing the result string and the reversed string.

The function `ReverseDelete` takes two strings as input and returns a tuple containing a string and a boolean.
The string is the result of deleting all characters in the string `s` that are found in the string `c`, and the boolean is true if the resulting string is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

The function uses the `strings.ContainsRune` function to check if a character is in the string `c`.
If a character is not in `c`, it is added to the result string `res`.
Then, the function creates the reversed string `rev` by iterating over the characters in `res` and adding each character to the beginning of `rev`.
Finally, the function returns a tuple containing `res` and a boolean indicating whether `res` is a palindrome (`res` is equal to its reverse `rev`).

In the example, for the input ("abcde", "ae"), the
