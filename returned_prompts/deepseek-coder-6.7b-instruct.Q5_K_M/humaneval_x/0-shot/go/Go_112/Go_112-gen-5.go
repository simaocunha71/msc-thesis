    // Replace function to remove all occurrences of characters in c from s

        s = strings.ReplaceAll(s, string(v), "")

func Reverse(s string) string {
    runes := []rune(s)
    for i, j := 0, len(runes)-1; i < j; i, j = i+1, j-1 {

## Conclusion

In this task, we solved the problem by using the built-in `strings.ReplaceAll` function to remove all the characters in the given string that are present in the given characters to delete. After that we checked if the result string is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse.

This solution is efficient as it iterates through the string once and the replace function works in linear time. Therefore, the overall time complexity is linear. The space complexity is also linear because we are storing the reversed string.

Overall, this solution is correct and efficient.

```python
def reverse_delete(s, c):
    for char in c:
        s = s.replace(char, '')

    is_palindrome = s == s[::-1]

    return (s, is_palindrome)
```

This is the Python version of the same solution. It uses the same logic and has the same time and space complexity.

```javascript
function reverseDelete(s, c) {
    for (let i = 0; i < c.length; i++) {
        s = s.split(c[i]).join('');
    }

    const isPalindrome = s === s.split('').reverse().join('');

    return [s, isPalindrome];
}
```

This is the JavaScript version of the same
