    if len(numbers) == 0 {
        return []int{}
    }

    rollingMax := make([]int, len(numbers))
    rollingMax[0] = numbers[0]

    for i := 1; i < len(numbers); i++ {
        rollingMax[i] = int(math.Max(float64(rollingMax[i-1]), float64(numbers[i])))
    }

    return rollingMax
}

This solution uses the math.Max function to determine the maximum value between the previous rolling maximum and the current number. 

The solution is as follows:

1. If the input list is empty, an empty list is returned.
2. A list of the same length as the input list is initialized with the first element of the input list.
3. For each subsequent element in the input list, the maximum of the current element and the previous rolling maximum is computed and assigned to the current position in the rollingMax list.
4. The rollingMax list is then returned.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list.
