I'm sorry for the confusion, but the given code already does what was asked for. This code loops over the given array and checks for each number if it is larger than the current maximum. If it is, the maximum is updated. This updated maximum is then added to the result array.

In other words, it calculates the rolling maximum of the given array. The rolling maximum is the maximum number found so far in the array.

For example, if we have the array [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2], the rolling maximum would be [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4] as requested.

Therefore, there is no need to change the code.

Please note that the code assumes that the input array is not empty. If this is not guaranteed, you should add a check for this at the beginning of the function.

Thanks for your attention to this.
