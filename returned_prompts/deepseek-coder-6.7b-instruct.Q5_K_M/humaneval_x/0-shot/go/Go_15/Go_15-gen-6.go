This code is a simple implementation of the function `StringSequence`. It takes an integer `n` as input and returns a string of numbers separated by spaces starting from `0` to `n` inclusive. If `n` is negative, the function will panic. If `n` is `0`, the function will return a string containing `0`.

It uses a for loop to generate the sequence and the `strconv.Itoa` function to convert integers to strings. The result string is initialized with `0` and then each number from `1` to `n` inclusive is added to the result string with a space in between.

The function is implemented in a way that it first checks if `n` is negative, if it is, it panics. Then it checks if `n` is `0`, if it is, it returns a string containing `0`. Finally, it generates the sequence of numbers from `0` to `n` inclusive and returns it as a string.

This is a simple implementation and may not be the most efficient for large values of `n`.
