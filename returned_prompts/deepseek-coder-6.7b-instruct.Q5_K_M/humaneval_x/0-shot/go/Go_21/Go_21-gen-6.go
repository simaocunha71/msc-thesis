// first we need to find min and max value of the list
min, max := math.MaxFloat64, -math.MaxFloat64
for _, num := range numbers {
if num < min {
min = num
}
if num > max {
max = num
}
}

// then we create new list and apply transform
rescaled := make([]float64, len(numbers))
for i, num := range numbers {
rescaled[i] = (num - min) / (max - min)
}
return rescaled
}
```

This function first finds the minimum and maximum values in the list. It then creates a new list and applies the linear transformation to each number in the list, rescaling it from the range [min, max] to [0, 1].

Please note that this function does not handle the case where the input list is empty. If an empty list is passed to this function, the function will panic. You may want to add some error checking to handle this case in a way that makes sense for your specific use case.

Also, this function assumes that the input numbers are not NaN or infinity. If this is not the case, you may need to add some error checking to handle these cases as well.

Finally, this function does not check if the input list has at least two elements. If this is not the case, the function will panic. You may want to add some error checking to handle this case in a way that makes sense for your specific use case.

This function is written in Go and it's a good practice to include comments to explain what the function does, the input and output, and any assumptions or constraints that the function makes.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else you'd like me to explain.
