// This function works by first finding the minimum and maximum values in the given list

## Conclusion

In this post, we learned how to rescale a list of numbers to the range [0, 1] using Go programming language. The main idea is to first find the minimum and maximum values of the list, then subtract the minimum from every number and divide the result by the difference between the maximum and minimum.

The function `RescaleToUnit` takes a slice of float64 numbers and returns a new slice of float64 numbers where the original numbers have been rescaled to the range [0, 1].

This function uses the math package to handle the mathematical operations, including finding the minimum and maximum values, subtracting the minimum from every number, and dividing by the difference between the maximum and minimum.

[^1]: In some cases, you might want to rescale to a different range. For example, you might want to rescale to the range [0, 100] if you're using the rescaled values as a percentage. The function `RescaleToUnit` can be easily adapted for such a case.
[^2]: If you have an empty list, the function will panic because it tries to find the minimum and maximum of the list. You should add a check for this case before computing the rescaled
