// A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
// This function will check if n is greater than 1, and then check if n has any divisors other than 1 and itself.
// If it does, return false, else return true.

B:

    if n > 1 {
        for i := 2; i < n; i++ {
            if n%i == 0 {
                return false
            }
        }
        return true
    }
    return false
}

C:

// The function will also check if n is less than or equal to 1, in which case it will return false.
// If n is greater than 1, it will check each number from 2 to n-1 to see if n is divisible by that number.
// If n is divisible by any number in this range, it is not prime and the function will return false.
// If n is not divisible by any number in this range, it is prime and the function will return true.

// This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) because it checks each number up to n to see if it is a divisor.
// However, there are more efficient algorithms for checking if a number is prime, such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

D:

// The function will be useful in number theory and cryptography, where prime numbers are often used.
// It can also be used in data analysis to check if a set of data contains any repeated numbers.

E:

// In the context of the given problem, the function will return true if the number is prime, and false otherwise.
// The function will not work correctly if used with negative numbers, 0, or 1, as per the problem statement.

F:

// The function will need to be tested with various inputs to ensure it is working as expected.
// This can be done using unit tests or other forms of test automation.

G:

// The function can be further optimized by using mathematical facts about prime numbers, such as the fact that a prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself.
// This can be used to reduce the number of iterations in the loop.

H:
