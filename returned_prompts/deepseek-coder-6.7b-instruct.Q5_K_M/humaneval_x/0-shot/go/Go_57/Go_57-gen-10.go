// In Go language, you can use range to iterate over the slice.
// 1. Initialize two variables to keep track of the increasing and decreasing parts of the sequence.
// 2. Use the range loop to iterate through the elements of the slice.
// 3. If the next element is greater than the current, then the sequence is increasing.
// 4. If the next element is less than the current, then the sequence is decreasing.

    increasing, decreasing := true, true

    for i := range l {
        if i != 0 {
            if l[i] < l[i-1] {
                increasing = false
            }
            if l[i] > l[i-1] {
                decreasing = false
            }
        }
    }

    return increasing || decreasing
}

func main() {

B:

// Testing the Monotonic function.

    fmt.Println(Monotonic([]int{1, 2, 4, 20})) // true
    fmt.Println(Monotonic([]int{1, 20, 4, 10})) // false
    fmt.Println(Monotonic([]int{4, 1, 0, -10})) // true
}
```
This program will print `true` for all monotonically increasing or decreasing arrays and `false` for all other arrays.

Please note that the function checks if the sequence is either strictly increasing or decreasing, not just increasing or decreasing. For example, the sequence `[1, 1, 1, 1]` is monotonically increasing and monotonically decreasing, so the function will return `true` for this sequence.

Also note that this function will return `true` for an empty slice, because it considers an empty slice to be monotonically increasing or decreasing.

If you want to return `false` for an empty slice, you can add a special case for it at the beginning of the function.

```go
func Monotonic(l []int) bool {
    if len(l) == 0 {
        return false
    }
    // Rest of the function...
}
```
This way, the function will return `false` for
