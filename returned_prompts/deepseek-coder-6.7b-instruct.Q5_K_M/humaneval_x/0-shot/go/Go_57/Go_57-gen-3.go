This code checks whether the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing by setting two boolean variables `increasing` and `decreasing` to `true`. It then goes through the list and checks if the current number is greater than the next one, or if it's smaller. If so, it sets the corresponding boolean to `false`. Finally, it checks if either `increasing` or `decreasing` is `true` and returns the result.

Note: This solution assumes that the list will have at least two elements. If the list can have less than two elements, you should add a special case to handle it.

Also, this solution assumes that the list will only contain integers. If the list can contain other types of elements, you should modify the solution to handle those cases.

Finally, this solution assumes that the list will not contain any duplicate elements. If the list can contain duplicate elements, you should modify the solution to handle those cases.
