// Sorting the array in ascending order
sort.Ints(arr)

// Iterating through the array from the end to the start
for i := len(arr) - 1; i > 0; i-- {

// Comparing the current element with the next one
if arr[i] < arr[i-1] {

// Returning the index of the element which is not greater than or equal to the one preceding it
return i-1
}
}

// If no such element is found, return -1
return -1
}
```

The function CanArrange takes a sorted array of integers as input. It sorts the array in ascending order and then iterates through it from the end to the start. For each element, it checks if the current element is less than the one preceding it. If it is, it returns the index of the preceding element. If no such element is found, it returns -1.

Here is how you can use the function in your program:

```go
func main() {
fmt.Println(CanArrange([]int{1, 2, 4, 3, 5})) // Output: 3
fmt.Println(CanArrange([]int{1, 2, 3})) // Output: -1
}
```

This program defines a main function that calls the CanArrange function with two different arrays and prints the result.

Remember to import the "sort" package at the beginning of your program to use the sort.Ints function.

```go
package main

import (
"fmt"
"sort"
)

// Your code here
```

Please note that the function assumes that the input array will not contain duplicate values. If you need to handle duplicate values, you may need to modify the function accordingly.

Also, the function assumes that the input array is already sorted in ascending order. If you need to sort the array first, you may need to modify the function accordingly.

In the provided example, the function was called with a sorted array of integers. If you need to sort the array before calling the function, you can use the sort.Ints function from the "sort" package.
