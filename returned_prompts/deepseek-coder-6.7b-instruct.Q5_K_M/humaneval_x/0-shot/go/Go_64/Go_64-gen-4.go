    var count int = 0
    vowels := []string{"a", "e", "i", "o", "u"}

B:
    for _, letter := range strings.ToLower(s) {
        for _, vowel := range vowels {
            if string(letter) == vowel {
                count++
            }
        }
    }

C:
    if strings.HasSuffix(s, "y") {
        count++
    }

D:
    return count
}
```

**Note:** This solution does not handle cases where the string contains characters other than alphabets. For instance, `VowelsCount("hello123")` will return 2, which is not correct. We could add a check for this scenario before proceeding with the solution, but for the sake of simplicity, we are assuming that the input string will only contain alphabets and spaces.

The solution is quite simple. It converts the string to lowercase and iterates over it. If a character matches any of the vowels, it increments the count. If the string ends with 'y' (ignoring case), it increments the count. Finally, it returns the count.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because we are iterating over the string once. The space complexity is O(1), as we are using a fixed amount of space to store the count and the vowels.

This solution could be optimized by using a set to store the vowels instead of an array, which would reduce the time complexity of the solution to O(1).
