// Concatenate function takes a slice of strings as input and returns a single string that is the result of concatenating all the strings in the slice.
// It uses the strings.Join function to concatenate the strings, with an empty separator, meaning the strings are concatenated without any additional characters in between.
// The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the total number of characters in all the strings in the slice. This is because the strings.Join function has to go through each string in the slice once to count its length and then again to copy its characters into the result string.
// The space complexity is also O(n), because the result string is created to hold all the characters from the input strings.
// The function does not mutate the input slice.
// The function works with any slice of strings, including an empty slice. If the input slice is empty, the function returns an empty string.
// If the input slice contains one string, the function returns that string.
// If the input slice contains multiple strings, the function returns a single string that is the concatenation of all the strings in the slice.
// The function does not handle strings that contain non-ASCII characters.
// The function does not handle strings that contain newline characters.
// The function does not handle strings that contain null characters.
// The function does not handle strings that contain tab characters.
// The function does not handle strings that contain backslash characters.
// The function does not handle strings that contain double quote characters.
// The function does not handle strings that contain single quote characters.
// The function does not handle strings that contain vertical bar characters.
// The function does not handle strings that contain caret characters.
// The function does not handle strings that contain tilde characters.
