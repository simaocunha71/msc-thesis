Note that the time complexity of the algorithm is O(nÂ²) because of the nested loop. This could be optimized to O(n log log n) using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, but this would require additional space.

In the provided solution, the function CountUpTo takes an integer n as input and returns an array of integers which represent the first n prime numbers. If n is less than 2, an empty array is returned. The function uses a loop to iterate over each number in the range from 2 to n. For each number, it checks if it is divisible by any number up to its square root. If it is not divisible by any such number, it is considered a prime number and is added to the result array. The function finally returns the array of prime numbers.

Also, it's worth mentioning that the function could be optimized further by only checking for divisibility up to the square root of the number, as any factors of the number would have already been checked.

Here is the Python version:

```python
def count_up_to(n):
    if n < 2:
        return []
    primes = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        for j in range(2, int(i ** 0.5) + 1):
