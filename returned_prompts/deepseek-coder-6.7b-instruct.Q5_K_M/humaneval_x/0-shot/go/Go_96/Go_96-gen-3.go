The function CountUpTo first checks if the input number is less than or equal to 1. If so, it returns an empty slice. If the number is greater than 1, it creates a slice to hold the prime numbers and then iterates from 2 to the input number, checking each one to see if it is a prime number. If a number is prime, it is added to the slice. The function then returns the slice of prime numbers.

The helper function isPrime checks if a number is prime by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number and checking if the number is divisible by any of these. If the number is divisible, it is not prime and the function returns false. If the number is not divisible by any of these, it is prime and the function returns true.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) because for each number from 2 to n, we are checking if it is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of that number. The space complexity is O(n) because in the worst case, we may have to store all the prime numbers up to n in the slice.

Note: We can improve the performance of the solution by using a more efficient algorithm for checking if a number is prime, such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes, which has a time complexity of O(n log log n).
