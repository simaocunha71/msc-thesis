```

This problem can be solved by counting the number of odd numbers in both lists. If the total number of odd numbers is even, it's possible to make all numbers in the first list even by exchanging elements between the lists. If the total number of odd numbers is odd, it's not possible to make all numbers in the first list even.
This solution works by iterating over each number in the first and second lists, and counting the number of odd numbers. If the total count of odd numbers is odd, the function returns "NO". Otherwise, the function returns "YES".
