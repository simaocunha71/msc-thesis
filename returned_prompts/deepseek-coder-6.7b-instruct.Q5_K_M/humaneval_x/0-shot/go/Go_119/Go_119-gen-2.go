The code starts by initializing an empty stack. It then iterates through each string in the list and for each character, it checks if it's an open parenthesis or a close parenthesis. If it's an open parenthesis, it pushes it into the stack. If it's a close parenthesis, it pops an element from the stack. If the stack is empty at the end, it means that all
