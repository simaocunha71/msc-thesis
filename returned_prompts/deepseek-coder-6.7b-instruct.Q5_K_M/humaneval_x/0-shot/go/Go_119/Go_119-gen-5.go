This solution uses a stack to keep track of the parentheses. It iterates over the string, pushing open parentheses onto the stack and popping them off when a close parenthesis is encountered. If a close parenthesis is encountered but there are no open parentheses on the stack, or if there are any open parentheses left on the stack after iterating over the string, it means the string is not good, so it returns 'No'. If the string is good, it returns 'Yes'.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string, because it iterates over the string once. The space complexity is also O(n), because in the worst case, all parentheses in the string could be open, and so they would all be pushed onto the stack.
