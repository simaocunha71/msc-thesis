## Code Explanation
This code takes an integer `n` and creates a list of `n` elements. The value of each element is determined by the rules given in the problem statement. 

The `for` loop iterates `n` times, and for each iteration, the value of the current element is determined by checking if the current index is even or odd. 

If the index is even, the value is set to `2*n - 1` (since it's the next odd number). If the index is odd, the value is set to `2*n + 1` (since it's the next even number). 

Finally, the function returns the list of stone levels.

## Test Cases
```go
func main() {
	fmt.Println(MakeAPile(3))  // should print [3, 5, 7]
	fmt.Println(MakeAPile(4))  // should print [4, 6, 8, 10]
	fmt.Println(MakeAPile(5))  // should print [5, 7, 9, 11, 13]
}
```
## Output
```go
[3 5 7]
[4 6 8 10]
[5 7 9 11 13]
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this code is O(n), as it iterates over the list of `n` elements once.

## Space Complexity
The space complexity of this code is O(n), as it creates a list of `n` elements.

## Conclusion
This code successfully implements the logic described in the problem statement. It correctly calculates and returns the number of stones in each level of the pile, based on the rules given in the problem statement.
