// The function WillItFly checks if a given object (represented as a list of integers) will fly. 
// The function takes in two arguments: a list q of integers and an integer w representing the maximum weight that the object can carry. 
// It first calculates the sum of the integers in the list and checks if the sum is greater than the maximum weight. 
// If it is, the function returns false, indicating that the object will not fly. 
// Then, the function checks if the list is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards). 
// If it is not, the function returns false, indicating that the object will not fly. 
// If the sum is not greater than the maximum weight and the list is a palindrome, the function returns true, indicating that the object will fly.

B:
// The for loop in function B is used to check if the list is a palindrome. 
// It compares the first and last elements of the list, then moves inward. 
// If it finds a pair of elements that are not the same, it returns false. 
// If it finishes the loop without finding any such pair, it returns true, indicating that the list is a palindrome.
