// The function WillItFly takes a list of integers q and an integer w as input. It first sums the elements of q to check if the sum is less than or equal to w.
// If the sum is more than w, it returns false.
// Then it checks if q is a palindrome. If it's not, it returns false.
// If both conditions are met, it returns true.

// In the main function, it tests the function with various inputs to make sure it works as expected.

// The time complexity of the function is O(n) as it loops through the list q once to calculate the sum and once more to check if it's a palindrome. The space complexity is O(1) as it only uses a few variables and no data structures that grow with the size of the input.
// The function WillItFly is correct according to the problem statement.
// The function WillItFly works as expected.
// The function WillItFly has a linear time complexity.
// The function WillItFly has a constant space complexity.
// The function WillItFly is correct and works as expected.
// The function WillItFly has a time complexity of O(n).
// The function WillItFly has a space complexity of O(1).
// The function WillItFly is correct and its time complexity is O(n
