The function WillItFly checks whether a list of integers q is a palindromic (it remains the same when reversed) and the sum of its elements is less than or equal to a given maximum weight w. It returns true if both conditions are met, and false otherwise.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the function:

1. Initialize a variable sum to 0. This will store the sum of the elements in the list q.

2. Loop through the list q and add each element to sum.

3. If sum is greater than w, return false as the sum of the elements in q is more than the maximum possible weight.

4. Loop through the list q in pairs (i.e., from the start and end of the list, moving towards the middle). If any pair of elements does not match (i.e., the list is not a palindrome), return false as q is not a palindrome.

5. If the function hasn't returned false by the time it has finished executing, it must have returned true. This is because if q is a palindrome and the sum of its elements is less than or equal to w, then q will "fly" and the function should return true.
