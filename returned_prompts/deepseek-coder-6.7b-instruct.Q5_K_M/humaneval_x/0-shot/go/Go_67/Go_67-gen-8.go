	apple,_ := strconv.Atoi(strings.Fields(s)[2])
	orange,_ := strconv.Atoi(strings.Fields(s)[4])
	
B:
	return n - apple - orange
}


A: The function FruitDistribution takes in two parameters, a string and an integer. The string parameter is meant to represent the distribution of apples and oranges in the form "x apples and y oranges". The integer parameter represents the total number of fruits in the basket. The function is supposed to return the number of mangoes in the basket.

B:
The function begins by parsing the string parameter to extract the number of apples and oranges. The strconv.Atoi function is used to convert the extracted strings to integers.

The function then returns the total number of fruits in the basket (n), subtracted by the number of apples and oranges. This is because the number of mangoes is equivalent to the total number of fruits in the basket minus the number of apples and oranges.

This solution assumes that the input string is always in the format "x apples and y oranges", where x and y are integers. If this is not the case, the function may not work as expected.

Also, this solution assumes that the total number of apples and oranges is always greater than zero. If this is not the case, the function may panic with an error.
