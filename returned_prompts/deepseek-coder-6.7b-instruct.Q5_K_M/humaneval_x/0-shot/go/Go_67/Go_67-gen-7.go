// This code should return the number of mangoes in the basket. The code is supposed
// to split the string to get the number of apples and oranges, subtract the number of
// apples and oranges from the total number of fruits to get the number of mangoes.
// However, there are two errors in the code.
// 1. The code doesn't handle the case when the string contains more than one digit for
// the number of apples and oranges. For example, "10 apples and 2 oranges" should be
// treated as "10 apples and 2 oranges" instead of "10 apples and 2 oranges".
// 2. The function signature is incorrect. The function should return an integer, but it
// returns nothing.
// Fix the errors in the code and make it correct.
// Hint:
// You can use the strings.Fields() function to split the string into words and
// strconv.Atoi() function to convert a string to an integer.
// Also, you can use the "+" operator to add two integers.
