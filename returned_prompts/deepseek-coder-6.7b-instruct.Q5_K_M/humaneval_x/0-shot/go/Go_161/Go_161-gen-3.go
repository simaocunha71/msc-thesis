## P.S.

This solution was written in Go language.

I assumed that the input string may contain runes that are not letters. I also assumed that the reversing operation should be performed on the entire string if it contains no letters.

The solution uses the built-in `unicode.IsLetter` and `unicode.IsLower` functions to check if a rune is a letter and if it is a lowercase letter, respectively. If a rune is a letter, its case is reversed by using the `unicode.ToUpper` and `unicode.ToLower` functions. If the string contains no letters, the entire string is reversed by swapping its elements.

I hope this solution satisfies your requirements. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you for your attention to this problem.
