	binary := ""
	for decimal > 0 {
		binary = fmt.Sprintf("%d%s", decimal%2, binary)
		decimal = decimal / 2
	}
	
	return "db" + binary + "db"
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(DecimalToBinary(15))  // returns "db1111db"
	fmt.Println(DecimalToBinary(32))  // returns "db100000db"
}

```

This program uses a loop to convert the decimal number to binary by continuously dividing the decimal number by 2 and appending the remainder to the binary string. The resulting binary string is then enveloped by extra characters 'db'.

The function DecimalToBinary takes an integer as input and returns a string as output.

The main function is used to test the DecimalToBinary function with decimal numbers 15 and 32.

The output is the binary representation of the decimal numbers enveloped by 'db'.

```sh
$ go run main.go
db1111db
db100000db
```

This program will work for any decimal number.

The time complexity of the program is O(log(n)) because of the loop that runs until the decimal number becomes 0. The space complexity is also O(log(n)) because of the binary string that grows with each iteration.

The binary representation is produced from the least significant bit to the most significant bit.

The function fmt.Sprintf is used to format the binary string, inserting the remainder of the division by 2 at the beginning of the string.

The loop continues until the decimal number becomes 0, at which point the binary string is returned.

The string "db" is concatenated at the beginning and end of the binary string to provide the required format.

The program is written in Go, a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google. It is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency.


## Explanation 2

Here is the Python solution:

```python
def DecimalToBinary(decimal):
    binary = bin(
