Here's the logic behind the solution:

The solution uses a simple division-by-2 algorithm to convert the decimal number to binary. The remainder is appended to the binary string in each step. The binary string is then enclosed by "db" at the beginning and end. 

It's also important to note that the conversion is done using the strconv.Itoa function instead of fmt.Sprintf, which is used in the original solution. The reason for this is that strconv.Itoa is more efficient and faster than fmt.Sprintf in this particular scenario.

Also, the fmt.Sprintf is used to concatenate the string with the binary number, which is more efficient than using the '+' operator.

The time complexity of this solution is O(log n), where n is the decimal number. This is because the number of steps required to convert a decimal number to binary is proportional to the logarithm of the number. 

The space complexity is also O(
