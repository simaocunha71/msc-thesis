// Test the function
func main() {
    fmt.Println(XOrY(7, 34, 12)) // should return 34
    fmt.Println(XOrY(15, 8, 5))  // should return 5

This program first checks if the input number is less than 2, which would mean it's not a prime number and returns the value of y. Then, it checks if the number is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. If it is, it returns y. If not, it returns x.

Note: This program uses the concept of prime numbers. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc.

Also, the function does not handle negative numbers, zero or non-integer values. You may want to add additional checks for these cases depending on your specific requirements.

Lastly, the XOrY function could be written more efficiently by checking divisibility only up to the square root of n, as any factor of n must be less than or equal to the square root of n.

This function can be used in a variety of programming contexts, such as in a web server to determine whether a user's input is a prime number.
