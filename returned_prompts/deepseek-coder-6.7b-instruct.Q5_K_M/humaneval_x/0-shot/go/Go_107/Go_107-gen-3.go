// Output:
// [1, 2]
// [4, 6]
// 
// Explanation:
// The code is checking each number up to the provided limit (n) to see if it's a palindrome. 
// A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward. 
// It then checks if the number is even or odd and increments the respective counter in the result array. 
// The function then returns the count of even and odd palindromes.
// This is a solution to the problem of counting even and odd integer palindromes in a given range.
// 
// The time complexity of the code is O(n), as it scans through each number up to n once.
// The space complexity is O(1), as it uses a constant amount of space to store the result and does not use any additional space that scales with the input size.
// 
// This code is written in Go, a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google. It's efficient in terms of both time and space.
// The code is tested and it works as expected.
// 
// Please note that the function name is 'EvenOddPalindrome' and it takes an integer as input and returns an array of two integers. 
// The first integer in the array represents the count
