    return true

This solution works by iterating over each number in the range up to `n` and checking if it is a palindrome. If it is, it then checks if the number of digits is even or odd and increments the corresponding count. The counts are then returned as a tuple.

The helper function `isPalindrome` checks if a number is a palindrome by converting it to a string and comparing the characters at the start and end of the string. It iterates towards the middle of the string, comparing characters as it goes. If it finds any pair of characters
