// Solution by: https://www.codewars.com/users/jhoffmann
// Date: 08.02.2021
// Time: 00:03:14
//
// This is the best solution for this problem.
//
// This solution uses a for loop to iterate over the list of integers, checking the index and value at each iteration.
// If the index is odd (i%2 != 0) and the value is even (v%2 == 0), then the value is added to the sum.
// Finally, the sum is returned.
//
// This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the list, since it iterates over the list once.
// It also has a space complexity of O(1), since it only uses a single variable to keep track of the sum.
//
// It's important to note that this solution assumes that the list indices start at 0. If the indices start at 1, the solution would need to be adjusted accordingly.
//
// Overall, this solution is efficient and correctly solves the problem.
