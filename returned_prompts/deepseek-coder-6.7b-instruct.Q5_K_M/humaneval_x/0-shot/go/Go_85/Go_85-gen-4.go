#### Answer:

Yes, the function you provided correctly sums the even elements at odd indices in an array of integers. It iterates over the array starting from the second index (as we start counting from 0 in Go) and increments by 2 each time to only look at the odd indices. It then checks if the element at that index is even and if so, adds it to the sum.

This is a correct implementation of the problem.
