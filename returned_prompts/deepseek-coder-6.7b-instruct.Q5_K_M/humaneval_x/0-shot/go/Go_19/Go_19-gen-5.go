    // Define a lookup table for numbers to their corresponding int values
    numberDict := map[string]int{
        "zero":  0,
        "one":   1,
        "two":   2,
        "three": 3,
        "four":  4,
        "five":  5,
        "six":   6,
        "seven": 7,
        "eight": 8,
        "nine":  9,
    }

    // Split the input string into a slice
    splitNumbers := strings.Split(numbers, " ")

    // Sort the slice using the lookup table
    sort.Slice(splitNumbers, func(i, j int) bool {
        return numberDict[splitNumbers[i]] < numberDict[splitNumbers[j]]
    })

    // Join the sorted slice back into a string
    sortedNumbers := strings.Join(splitNumbers, " ")

    return sortedNumbers
}
```

### Testing

```go
import "testing"

func TestSortNumbers(t *testing.T) {
    t.Run("Test SortNumbers", func(t *testing.T) {
        got := SortNumbers("three one five")
        want := "one three five"

        if got != want {
            t.Errorf("got %q want %q", got, want)
        }
    })
}
```

## Conclusion

In Go, you can use the `sort` and `strings` packages to solve many problems. The `sort` package provides functions for sorting slices and the `strings` package provides functions for manipulating strings. This includes splitting a string into a slice, sorting that slice, and then joining the sorted slice back into a string. 

In this problem, I used a map to create a lookup table that maps the string representation of numbers to their integer values. This allows me to sort the numbers by their integer values instead of their string values.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) because of the sort operation, and a space complexity of O(n) because of the split and join operations.
