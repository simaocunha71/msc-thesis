The code splits the input string `numbers` into a slice of words. Then it sorts the slice in place using the `sort.Slice` function, which sorts the elements using the provided function `func(i, j int) bool`. This function returns `true` if the i-th element is less than the j-th element, and `false` otherwise. In this case, it uses a map `numMap` to convert the words into numbers, and then compares the numbers. The sorted words are then joined back into a string with spaces in between.

The variable `numMap` is a map that maps the words to their corresponding numbers. The `sort.Slice` function uses this map to compare the numbers corresponding to the words.

The code then returns the sorted string.
