## Code Review

The code is clear, simple and efficient.

The function `SortEven` takes an input array `l` of integers and returns a new array where the values at the even indices are sorted in ascending order, while the values at the odd indices are left as they are.

The function starts by creating a new array `even` to store the values at the even indices of the input array `l`. Then it sorts this array.

The function then creates a new array `result` of the same length as `l`. The values at the even indices of `result` are set to the corresponding values in the sorted `even` array. The values at the odd indices of `result` are set to the corresponding values in the input array `l`.

Finally, the function returns `result`.

The code also includes a `main` function to test `SortEven` with the example inputs provided in the question.

Overall, the code is well-structured and follows good practices for array manipulation and sorting in Go.

The code does not have any obvious errors or bugs. It should work as expected.

```go
func SortEven(l []int) []int {
	even := make([]int, 0)

	for i := 0; i < len(l); i += 2 {
		even = append(even, l[i])
	}

	sort.Ints(even)

	result
