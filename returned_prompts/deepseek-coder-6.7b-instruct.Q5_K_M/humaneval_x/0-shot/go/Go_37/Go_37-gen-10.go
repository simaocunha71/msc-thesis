This program works by first creating a new slice with only the values at the even indices of the input slice. It then sorts this slice and creates a new result slice, which has the same values at the even indices as the input slice, but the values at the odd indices are the sorted values from the even indices slice.

The time complexity of this program is O(n log n) because of the sort.Ints function, where n is the length of the input slice. The space complexity is O(n) because of the additional space required for the even_indices_values and res slices.

However, the actual time complexity of this program is O(n^2) due to the append operation inside the loop. This is because every time we append a value to even_indices_values, a new underlying array might need to be allocated, which takes O(n) time. Therefore, the overall time complexity of the program is O(n^2).

Here is the optimized version of the program:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sort"
)

func SortEven(l []int) []int {
	evenIdxValues := make
