// This function works by first checking if the length of the second word is larger than the first word. If it is, it returns false because a rotation of a word of length n can never be a substring of a word of length less than n.
// The function then creates a slice of the second word rotated and appends it to itself. This is done by taking the first character of the word and appending it to the end of the word, effectively rotating it.
// Then, it checks if any of the rotations of the second word are substrings of the first word. If any are, it returns true.
// If no rotations of the second word are substrings of the first word, it returns false.

// This function runs in O(n^2) time because in the worst case, it needs to check if each rotation of the second word is a substring of the first word, which requires checking if the first word contains the second word, which can take up to O(n) time.
// It also requires O(n) space to store the rotations of the second word.
// This is a fairly efficient solution for this problem.

// Note that this solution assumes that the words are case sensitive and do not contain any special characters. If these assumptions do not hold, additional error checking may be needed.
