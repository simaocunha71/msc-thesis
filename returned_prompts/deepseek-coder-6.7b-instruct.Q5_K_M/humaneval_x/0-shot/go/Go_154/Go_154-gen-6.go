### Goal

The goal of the program is to check if the second word or any of its rotations is a substring in the first word.

### Process

- Initialize a `for` loop to rotate the second word by taking the first character and appending it to the end of the word.
- Check if the rotated word is a substring of the first word using the `strings.Contains` function.
- If the rotated word is a substring of the first word, return `true`.
- If no rotation of the second word is a substring of the first word after the `for` loop finishes, return `false`.

### Code Review

- This program is well structured and easy to understand.
- It uses the `strings.Contains` function to check if a substring is present in a string.
- The use of the `for` loop with the rotation of the second word is efficient in achieving the required task.

### Efficiency

- The time complexity of the program is O(n*m), where n is the length of the first word and m is the length of the second word. This is because for each rotation of the second word, we are checking if it is a substring of the first word which takes O(n) time.
- The space complexity of the program is O(1), as no extra space is used that scales with the size of
