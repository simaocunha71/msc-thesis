    sort.Ints(x)
    result := make([]int, 0)
    for _, num := range x {
        if hasEvenDigit(num) {
            continue
        }
        result = append(result, num)
    }
    return result
}

func hasEvenDigit(n int) bool {
    for n > 0 {
        digit := n % 10
        if digit % 2 == 0 {
            return true
        }
        n /= 10
    }
    return false
}

I am trying to understand the code better. What does this program do?


*

*What is the purpose of the function hasEvenDigit(n int)? What does it check for in the input number?

*In the UniqueDigits function, the result slice is initially created with a capacity of 0. How does this affect the performance of the function?

*What is the difference between sort.Ints(x) and sort.Sort(sort.IntSlice(x))?

*In the UniqueDigits function, how does the append operation work in the loop?

*Why is it that the UniqueDigits function returns a sorted list of all elements that doesn't have any even digit?


A: *

*hasEvenDigit(n int) checks for even digits in the number by iterating over the individual digits of the number. It checks if the digit is divisible by 2 (i.e., it's even). If it finds an even digit, it immediately returns true. If it doesn't find any even digits, it returns false.

*Creating a slice with a capacity of 0 doesn't affect the performance of the function in any way. It's just a way to avoid unnecessary memory allocation.

*sort.Ints(x) is a convenient function that sorts the slice x in increasing order. Internally, it calls sort.Sort(sort.IntSlice(x)). The reason to use sort.Ints instead of sort.Sort(sort.IntSlice(x)) is that sort.Ints is more readable and shorter.

*In the loop of the UniqueDigits function, append adds a new element to the end
