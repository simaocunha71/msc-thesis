// This function checks if the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers can sum up to n
// If it can, return true, otherwise return false

// The function is checking if the sum of the first 4 positive even numbers can sum up to n
// If it can, that means n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers
// If it can't, that means n can't be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers
// So, if sum of the first 4 positive even numbers is equal to n, return true, otherwise return false

// The function uses a for loop to generate the first 4 positive even numbers and appends them to a slice
// Then, it calculates the sum of these numbers
// If the sum is equal to n, it returns true, otherwise it returns false

// The function works by iterating over the first 4 positive even numbers and checking if the sum of these numbers is equal to n
// If it is, it means n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers, so it returns true
// If it isn't, it means n can't be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers, so it returns false
