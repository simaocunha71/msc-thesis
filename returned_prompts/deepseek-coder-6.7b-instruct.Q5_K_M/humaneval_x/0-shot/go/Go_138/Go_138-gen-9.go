This code uses a recursive approach to check all possible combinations of 4 positive even numbers that add up to the given number `n`. It starts by checking if `n` is an even number. If not, it immediately returns false. Then it checks all possible combinations of 4 positive even numbers that add up to `n`. It does this by subtracting each even number from `n` and recursively calling `IsEqualToSumEven` on the result. If any of these calls return true, the function returns true. If no combination is found, the function returns false.

Note that this code might not work correctly for large numbers because it uses recursion and might cause a stack overflow error. A more efficient way to solve this problem would be to use an iterative approach with a loop instead of recursion.

The time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the given number. This is because it checks all possible combinations of 4 positive even numbers that add up to `n`. The space complexity is O(n), which is the maximum depth of the recursion stack.

Please note that this code does not work as expected, because it doesn't check if the number can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. It checks if the number can be written as the sum of any number of positive even numbers. The correct code would need to keep track of the number of even numbers used in the sum and return true if exactly 4 are used.

Here is the correct code:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func IsEqualToSumEven(n int) bool {
	if n%2 != 0 {
		return false
	}

	count := 0
	for i := 2; i <= n; i += 2 {
		if IsEqualToSumEven(n - i) {
			count++
			if count == 4 {
				return true
			}
