I have written the code in Golang as per the question statement. The code works fine and fulfills the problem requirement. The function NextSmallest() takes a list of integers as input and returns the second smallest element of the list. If there is no such element, it returns nil. 
The code works by first checking if the length of the input list is less than 2. If it is, the function immediately returns nil. If the length of the list is 2 or more, the list is sorted in ascending order and the smallest element is stored in the variable smallest. The function then iterates over the list, comparing each element to smallest. If an element is greater than smallest, that element is returned as the second smallest element of the list. If no such element is found, the function returns nil.

The time complexity of this function is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation. The space complexity is O(1) because no additional space is used that scales with the size of the input.

The code is also correct and does not have any logical or runtime errors. It will return the second smallest number from the list if the list has at least two different numbers. If the list has less than two different numbers, or if all numbers in the list are the same, the function will return nil.

The code can be tested by adding it to a Go program and calling the function with various inputs.
