    if len(lst) < 2 {
        return nil
    }

    sort.Ints(lst)

    smallest := math.MaxInt64
    second_smallest := math.MaxInt64

    for _, value := range lst {
        if value < smallest {
            second_smallest = smallest
            smallest = value
        } else if value < second_smallest && value > smallest {
            second_smallest = value
        }

    if second_smallest == math.MaxInt64 {

    return second_smallest
}
```

## Solution:

This problem can be solved by using a sorting function to sort the list and then iterating through the list to find the second smallest element.

First, we need to check if the length of the list is less than 2. If so, we return nil because there cannot be a second smallest element in this case.

Then, we sort the list in ascending order.

We initialize two variables smallest and second_smallest to the maximum possible integer value. These variables will be used to keep track of the smallest and second smallest elements in the list.

We then iterate through the list. If we find an element that is smaller than the current smallest, we update second_smallest with the current smallest and update smallest with the new element. If we find an element that is larger than the smallest but smaller than the second smallest, we update second_smallest with this new element.

Finally, we check if second_smallest is still its initial value (which means we didn't find a second smallest element). If so, we return nil. Otherwise, we return the second_smallest.
