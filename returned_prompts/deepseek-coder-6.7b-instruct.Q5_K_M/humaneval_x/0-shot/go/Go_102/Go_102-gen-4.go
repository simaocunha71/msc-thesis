	var max int = -1

B:

// This loop starts from the biggest number in the range [x, y] and iteratively checks each number.
	for i := y; i >= x; i-- {

C:

// This conditional statement checks if the current number i is even. If it's not even, then it skips to the next
// iteration.
		if i%2 != 0 {

D:

// If the current number i is even, then it checks if it's bigger than the current maximum number. If it's bigger,
// then it updates the maximum number.

E:

// This return statement returns the maximum even number that is in the range [x, y]. If there's no such number,
