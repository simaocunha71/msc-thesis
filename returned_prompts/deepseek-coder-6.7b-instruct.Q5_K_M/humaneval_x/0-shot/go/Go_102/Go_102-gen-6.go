## Explanation
This program uses a loop to iterate over the range from y to x inclusive. It checks if each number is even by using the modulus operator % which gives the remainder of the division by 2. If the remainder is 0, it is an even number and it is returned. If no even number is found in the given range, the function returns -1. 

The function `ChooseNum` is defined to take two integers `x` and `y` as inputs and returns the biggest even integer number that is in the range `[x, y]`. If there's no such number, then the function should return `-1`.

The `main` function is used to test the `ChooseNum` function. It calls `ChooseNum` with the arguments `12` and `15`, which should return `14`, and `13` and `12`, which should return `-1`.
