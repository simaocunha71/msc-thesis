    count := 0
    for _, val := range arr {
        sum := 0
        strVal := strconv.Itoa(int(math.Abs(float64(val))))
        for _, ch := range strVal {
            digit, _ := strconv.Atoi(string(ch))
            sum += digit
        }
        if sum > 0 {

}

In this solution, we iterate over the array. For each number, we first convert it to its absolute value (so we can handle negative numbers), then convert it to a string so we can iterate over its digits. For each digit, we convert it back to an integer and add it to the sum. Finally, if the sum of the digits is greater than 0, we increment the count. The function then returns the count.

This solution is more efficient than the previous one, as it avoids the need to repeatedly divide and modulo the number, and it also correctly handles negative numbers.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the array, because we iterate over the array once. The space complexity is O(1), because we only use a constant amount of space to store the count and the temporary variables.

Note: The strconv.Itoa and strconv.Atoi functions are used to convert between integers and strings, which is necessary because we need to iterate over the digits of the number.

Also, the math.Abs function is used to convert the number to its absolute value, because we want to count the digits of the absolute value of the number, even if it is negative.

In both solutions, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the array. The space complexity is O(1), because
