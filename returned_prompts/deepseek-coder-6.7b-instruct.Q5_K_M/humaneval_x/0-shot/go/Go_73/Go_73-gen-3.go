// Test Cases:
func main() {
	fmt.Println(SmallestChange([]int{1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 9, 6})) // should return 4
	fmt.Println(SmallestChange([]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2})) // should return 1
	fmt.Println(SmallestChange([]int{1, 2, 3, 2, 1})) // should return 0
}

// Complexity Analysis:
// 
// The time complexity of this solution is O(n), as we need to iterate through half of the array once to check if it's a palindrome. 
// The space complexity is O(1), as we only need a constant amount of space to store the count of changes and the length of the array.
// The solution is correct as it checks if the array is a palindrome by comparing the elements at the start and end of the array and working towards the center.
// The solution also handles arrays of odd and even lengths correctly, as it only needs to check half the array.
// 
// Please note that this solution assumes that the input array is valid and non-empty.
// If the input array can be empty, you should add a check for this at the start of the function.
// 
// Also, this solution assumes that the elements of the array can be changed to make it a palindrome.
// If the elements of the array must remain the same, you should return a different result.
// 
// Finally, this solution assumes that the input array contains integers.
// If the input array can contain non-integer elements, you should add a check for this at the start of the function.
// 
// Please note that this solution is case sensitive. If you want to make it case insensitive, you should convert all elements to lower or upper case before comparing them.
