    count := 0
    for i := 0; i < len(arr)/2; i++ {
        if arr[i] != arr[len(arr)-1-i] {
            count++
        }
    }
    return count
}
```

Testing:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println(SmallestChange([]int{1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6}))  // Output: 4
    fmt.Println(SmallestChange([]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2}))  // Output: 1
    fmt.Println(SmallestChange([]int{1, 2, 3, 2, 1}))  // Output: 0
}
```

This Go program works by iterating over the first half of the array and comparing each element with its corresponding element from the end of the array. If they are not equal, we increment a counter. Finally, we return the count which is the minimum number of changes needed to make the array palindromic.

The time complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the length of the input array. This is because we are iterating over the array once. The space complexity is O(1), as we are using a constant amount of space to store the count and the indices.

Please note that the problem description mentions that we can change one element to any other element, but in the examples provided, the minimum number of changes needed to make the array palindromic is 1, 0, and 0 respectively. This might be a mistake in the problem's description or the examples provided. If we can only change one element to any other element, then we need to compare the count of elements that are different from its corresponding element in the other half of the array and return the maximum of these counts.

Thank you for your time.
