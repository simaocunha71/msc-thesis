The function `SmallestChange` takes an array `arr` as input and returns the minimum number of changes required to make the array palindromic. The function works by iterating through the array only up to its midpoint and comparing each element to its corresponding element from the end of the array. If the elements are not equal, it increments a counter. The final count of changes is returned.

This is a solution for the problem in Golang. It uses a single loop to compare elements from both ends of the array, making it an O(n) time complexity solution.

The function `SmallestChange` works correctly for all inputs provided in the problem statement.

Please note that the problem statement is a bit ambiguous, as it doesn't specify the criteria for the elements to be changed. In this solution, any two different elements can be changed to each other. If the criteria should be strictly that only the elements at the ends of the array should be changed to make it palindromic, the function should be modified accordingly.

The space complexity of this solution is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the input array and the count of changes.

This solution assumes that the input array is not empty and contains at least one element. If this is not the case, additional error checking should be added.
