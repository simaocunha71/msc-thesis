// Here we check for the length of the string and then we iterate from 2 to the square root of the length of the string.

// This function will return true if the length of the string is a prime number and false otherwise.
// It uses the prime definition that a prime number is a number that has exactly two positive divisors: 1 and itself.
// It checks if the length of the string is divisible by any number up to its square root, if it is, it is not a prime number.
// If it is not divisible by any number up to its square root, it is a prime number.
// This is a simple and efficient way to check if a number is prime.

This program defines a function `PrimeLength` that takes a string as input and returns `true` if the length of the string is a prime number and `false` otherwise. It uses a simple mathematical property of prime numbers to check if the length of the string is prime.

The function iterates from 2 to the square root of the length of the string and checks if the length of the string is divisible by any number in this range. If it is divisible, the function returns `false` because the length of the string is not a prime number. If the function iterates through all numbers up to the square root of the length of the string without finding a divisor, it returns `true` because the length of the string is a prime number.

The main function tests the `PrimeLength` function with different strings
