A: 
The current code has some errors. It can't run, and I can't figure out what. 

The code doesn't have syntax errors, but it doesn't work as intended. It tries to import unicode package that is not used in the code. The unicode.IsUpper function is not used in the code either. The code does not handle the case of non-alphabetic characters correctly.

I'm trying to solve the problem in a way that the function receives a string, flips the case of each character in the string, and returns the new string.

You can use the strings.ToLower and strings.ToUpper functions to flip case of each character. Here's how you can do it:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"
)

func FlipCase(str string) string {
	var result string
	for _, char := range str {
		if strings.ToLower(string(char)) == string(char) {
			result += strings.ToUpper(string(char))
		} else {
			result += strings.ToLower(string(char))
		}
	}
	return result
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(FlipCase("Hello")) // Outputs: hELLO
}
```

In this code, strings.ToLower and strings.ToUpper functions are used to convert the character to lower case and upper case respectively. Then, we check if the character is lower case by comparing the lower case version of the character with the original character. If they are equal, it means the original character was upper case, so we convert it to lower case, otherwise we convert it to upper case.

This code will work correctly for all kinds of characters, not
