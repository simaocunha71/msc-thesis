    upperVowels := 0
    vowels := "AEIOU"

B:
    for i := 0; i < len(s); i+=2 {
        if strings.ContainsRune(vowels, rune(s[i])) {
            upperVowels++
        }
    }

    return upperVowels
}
```

#### 2.2.2.2. Testing the code

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println(CountUpper("aBCdEf")) // returns 1
    fmt.Println(CountUpper("abcdefg")) // returns 0
    fmt.Println(CountUpper("dBBE")) // returns 0
}
```

#### 2.2.2.3. Running the code

To run the code, just paste it into a Go playground or your local Go environment and run it. You should see the output printed in your terminal.

### 2.2.3. Explanation

The code takes advantage of Go's string manipulation capabilities and built-in functions. It uses a loop to iterate over the string by 2 characters at a time (using the step of 2 in the loop). It then checks if the character at each even index is an uppercase vowel. If it is, it increments the counter. Finally, it returns the count of uppercase vowels at even indices.

### 2.2.4. Improvement

The current solution could be improved by:

- Handling non-alphabet characters: The current solution assumes that the input string only contains alphabet characters. If the string contains non-alphabet characters, the function may not work as expected.
- Handling empty string: The current solution assumes that the input string is not empty. If the string is empty, the function will return 0.

## 2.3. Conclusion

In conclusion, the provided solution is a simple and efficient way to count uppercase vowels in even indices of a string in Go. It shows how to use a loop, string manipulation, and built-in functions to solve a problem.
