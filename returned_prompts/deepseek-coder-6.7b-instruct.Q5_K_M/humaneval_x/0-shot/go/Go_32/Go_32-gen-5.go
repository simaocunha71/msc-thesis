A: The function FindZero does not work as expected. It seems you are trying to solve a quadratic equation ax^2+bx=0, where a=xs[0], b=xs[1]. The formula to solve this equation is x=-b/a.
The function FindZero should look something like this:
func FindZero(xs []int) float64 {
    if len(xs) > 1 && xs[1] != 0 {
        return float64(-xs[0]) / float64(xs[1])
    }
    return 0
}

This function will return the root of the given quadratic equation if it exists. If the coefficients of the quadratic equation are not given correctly, it will return 0.
Please note that this function will only work correctly if the given quadratic equation has a real root. If the quadratic equation has complex roots, this function will not work correctly.
