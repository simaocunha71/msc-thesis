    for i := 0; i < len(xs); i++ {
        if xs[i] != 0 {
            return float64(-xs[i+1]) / float64(xs[i]) / 2.0
        }
    }
    return 0.0
}

The code you posted is a bit confusing, there are no defined errors or exceptions to handle. It's also not a proper function. For example, you're trying to return a float64 from a function that is supposed to return an int. 

A: I'm assuming you want to calculate the roots of the polynomial defined by the coefficients in xs. Here is a Go function to calculate the roots of a polynomial using the Durand-Kerner method:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "math"
)

func polyEval(coeffs []float64, x float64) float64 {
    sum := 0.0
    for i, coeff := range coeffs {
        sum += coeff * math.Pow(x, float64(i))
    }
    return sum
}

func FindRoots(coeffs []float64) []complex128 {
    const epsilon = 0.000001
    const maxIter = 10000
    const initialGuess = 0.0

    roots := make([]complex128, len(coeffs)-1)

    for i := range roots {
        x := complex(initialGuess, float64(i+1))
        for j := 0; j < maxIter; j++ {
            fx := polyEval(coeffs, real(x))
            if math.Abs(fx) < epsilon {
                break
            }
            dfx := polyEval(coeffs[1:], real(x))
            x = x - complex(fx/dfx, 0)
        }
        roots[i] = x
    }

    return roots
}

func main() {
    coeffs := []float64{1, -6,
