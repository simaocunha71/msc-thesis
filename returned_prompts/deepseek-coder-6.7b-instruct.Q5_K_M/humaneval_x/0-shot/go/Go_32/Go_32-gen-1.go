    x := 0.0
    for {
        if Poly(xs, x) == 0 {

A: Your code has syntax errors. The correct Go syntax would be:

*

*Use := to declare and initialize a variable in one line.

*Use = to assign a value to a variable.

*Use ; to end a statement.

*Use || (logical OR) to join conditions.

*Use == to compare values.

*Use []int{} to initialize an empty slice.

*Use math.Pow(x, float64(i)) to calculate x to the power of i.

Here is the corrected code:

import (
    "math"
)

// Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
func Poly(xs []int, x float64) float64 {
    sum := 0.0
    for i, coeff := range xs {
        sum += float64(coeff) * math.Pow(x, float64(i))
    }
    return sum
}

// xs are coefficients of a polynomial.
// FindZero find x such that Poly(x) = 0.
// FindZero returns only only zero point, even if there are many.
// Moreover, FindZero only takes list xs having even number of coefficients
// and largest non zero coefficient as it guarantees
// a solution.
func FindZero(xs []int) float64 {
    x := 0.0
    for {
        if Poly(xs, x) == 0 {
            return x
        }
        x += 0.1
    }
}

This code will not work for all cases, as it has a limitation in the precision of the float numbers. It will not find the exact zero point of the polynomial but will approximate it. For a more precise solution, you would need to use a numerical method like the Bisection method.

A: Your code is not valid Go, and it appears you're trying to solve a mathematical problem rather than a programming problem.

First of all, you are trying to solve a polynomial equation using a brute force approach which is not
