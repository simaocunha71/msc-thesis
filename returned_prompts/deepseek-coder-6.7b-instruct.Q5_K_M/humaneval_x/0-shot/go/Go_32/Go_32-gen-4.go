The question is in the code, I'm trying to understand the logic behind the code.

A: The code implements the Newton-Raphson method for finding roots of a polynomial. The method starts with an initial guess of -1, 0, or 1 for each half of the polynomial, and iteratively improves the guess by taking the average of the guess and the result of dividing the polynomial by its derivative at the guess.

The function `Poly` evaluates a polynomial with coefficients `xs` at point `x`.

The function `FindZero` starts with an initial guess of -1, 0, or 1 for each half of the polynomial, and then checks if the polynomial evaluates to 0 at these guesses. If it does, it returns the guess. If not, it generates a new guess by averaging the last guess and the result of dividing the polynomial by its derivative at the last guess, and repeats the process.

The reason for using the initial guesses of -1, 0, or 1 is that these are the possible roots of the polynomial when the degree of the polynomial is even, and these roots are guaranteed to exist.

The `goto A` statement is used to restart the process of generating guesses if no root has been found after a certain number of iterations. This is done to ensure that the algorithm always converges to a
