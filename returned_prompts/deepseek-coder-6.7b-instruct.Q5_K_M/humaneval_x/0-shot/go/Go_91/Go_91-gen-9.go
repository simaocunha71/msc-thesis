    count := 0
    re := regexp.MustCompile("[.|?|!]")
    splits := re.Split(S, -1)

B:
    for _, sentence := range splits {
        if strings.HasPrefix(strings.TrimSpace(sentence), "I") {
            count++
        }
    }

C:
    return count
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(IsBored("Hello world"))
    fmt.Println(IsBored("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather"))
}


A: 
You have split the sentence into words and now you need to count the number of
sentences that start with 'I'. If the sentence starts with 'I', you increment the count.

B: 

You loop through each sentence in the slice of sentences. If the sentence starts
with 'I', you increment the count.

C: 

You return the count of sentences that start with 'I'.

This program is not working as expected. The function IsBored returns 0 for both examples. The function is supposed to return 1 for the second sentence.

Can you please help me debug this function?


A: Your function isn't working as expected because of the trim spaces and case sensitivity. The function is checking if the sentence starts with 'I' (upper case), but in your input, it's 'i' (lower case). The function should be checking if the sentence starts with 'i' (lower case) to be correct.

Here is the corrected function:

```go
import (
    "regexp"
    "strings"
)

func IsBored(S string) int {
    count := 0
    re := regexp.MustCompile("[.|?|!]")
    splits := re.Split(S, -1)

    for _, sentence := range splits {
        if strings.HasPrefix(strings.TrimSpace(sentence), "i") {
            count++
        }
    }

    return count
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(IsBored("Hello world"))
    fmt
