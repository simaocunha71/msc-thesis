    Here, we start by initializing a counter to 0.

B:
    We split the input string into sentences based on the delimiters '.', '?', or '!' using regexp.Split.

C:
    We then iterate over each sentence, checking if it starts with the word "I". If it does, we increment the counter.

D:
    Finally, we return the count of boredom sentences.

E:
    The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of sentences in the input string. This is because we have to iterate over every sentence in the string to check if it starts with the word "I". The space complexity is also O(n), as we split the string into sentences and store them in a slice.

F:
    This function assumes that the input string is well-formed and does not contain any special characters or numbers.

Explanation:
In the given string "The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather", there is one sentence that starts with "I", i.e., "I love this weather
