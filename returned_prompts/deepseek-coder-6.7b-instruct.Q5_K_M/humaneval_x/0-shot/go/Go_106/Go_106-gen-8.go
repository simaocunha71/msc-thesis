// The function F iterates through the numbers 1 to n (inclusive) and appends to the result array the factorial of the number if it is even, 
// and the sum of the numbers from 1 to the number if it is odd.

// The factorial function calculates the factorial of a number using recursion. If the number is 0, it returns 1 (since the factorial of 0 is 1). 
// Otherwise, it returns the number multiplied by the factorial of the number minus 1.

// The sum function calculates the sum of the numbers from 1 to a given number using the formula n * (n + 1) / 2.

// The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the size of the input array. This is because it iterates through the numbers 1 to n 
// (inclusive) once. The space complexity is also O(n), because it creates a new array to store the result.

// The main function is not required in this problem because the problem is about solving a mathematical function, not about solving a problem using a specific programming language.
// The main function is usually used to call the function and print the result.

// For example:
// func main() {
//   fmt.Println(F(5))
// }
// This would print: [1, 2, 6, 24, 15]
// Which is the expected output.
// Note: This code needs to be placed in a Go file (with the extension .go) and compiled using the Go compiler to run.
// Also, the code doesn't check for the input validation (i
