## Implementation

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func F(n int) []int {
	arr := make([]int, n)
	for i := range arr {
		arr[i] = 1
	}

	for i := 1; i < n; i++ {
		if i%2 == 0 {
			arr[i] = i * arr[i-1]
		} else {
			arr[i] = i + arr[i-1]
		}
	}

	return arr
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(F(5)) // [1, 2, 6, 24, 15]
}
```

## Explanation

The function `F` is implemented to return an array of size `n` filled with the required values. The array is initially filled with 1's. Then, a loop is run from 1 to `n-1` (since we are starting from index 1).

For each index `i`, if `i` is an even number, the value at that index is calculated as the product of `i` and the previous value (`arr[i-1]`). If `i` is odd, the value at that index is calculated as the sum of `i` and the previous value (`arr[i-1]`).

The result will be a list of size `n` where the value of the element at index `i` is the factorial of `
