This solution works by iterating over the string and pushing each "<" character to a stack. When it encounters a ">" character, it pops the last element from the stack. If there are any ">" characters left in the string after all "<" characters have been processed, the bracketing is incorrect, so the function returns false. If the stack is empty at the end of the string, all brackets are correctly matched, so the function returns true.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string, because it iterates over the string once. The space complexity is also O(n), because in the worst case (when all characters are "<"), the stack could contain n/2 elements.

This solution assumes that the input string is well-formed, i.e., it only contains "<" and ">" characters. If the input string could contain other characters, the solution would need to be modified to handle those cases.

Note: This solution uses Go language.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func CorrectBracketing(brackets string) bool  {
	stack := []rune{}

	for _, c := range brackets {
		if c == '<' {
			stack = append(stack, c)
		} else {
			if len(stack) == 0 {
				return false
			}
			stack = stack[:len(stack)-1]
