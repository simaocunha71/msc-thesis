// create a stack to hold the brackets
stack := []rune{}

B:

// iterate over the brackets
for _, b := range brackets {

    // if the bracket is an opening bracket, push it to the stack
    if b == '<' {
        stack = append(stack, b)
        continue
    }

    // if the stack is empty, return false because this is a closing bracket but there is no opening bracket to match with
    if len(stack) == 0 {
        return false
    }

    // pop the last opening bracket from the stack
    stack = stack[:len(stack)-1]
}

// if the stack is empty, return true because all brackets were matched
if len(stack) == 0 {
    return true
}

// if there are still brackets left in the stack, return false because not all opening brackets have closing brackets
return false
}
```

This program works by using a stack to keep track of the opening brackets that have not yet been matched with a closing bracket. It iterates over the input string and for each character, if it is an opening bracket, it pushes it onto the stack. If it is a closing bracket, it pops the last opening bracket from the stack. If the stack is empty at the end, it means that all brackets were matched correctly and returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string, because it iterates over the string once. The space complexity is also O(n), in the worst case where all brackets are opening brackets and they all need to be pushed onto the stack.

It is a good example of how to use a stack data structure to solve a problem.

## Testing

You can test this function using the following Go code:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println(CorrectBracketing("<"))         // Output: false
	fmt.Println(CorrectBracketing("<>"))        // Output: true
	fmt.Println(CorrectBracketing("<<><>>"))    // Output: true
