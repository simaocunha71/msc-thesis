## Code Explanation:
The program reads a 2D list or a matrix and an integer x. It iterates over the 2D list, checking each element for the value of x. If it finds a match, it records the indices of the match in a list of tuples. It then sorts the list of tuples first by the row index in ascending order, and then by the column index in descending order.

## Solution:
The problem is about searching for an integer in a 2D list and returning its coordinates. The coordinates are sorted by row in ascending order and by column in descending order.

To solve this problem, we can use a loop to go through each element of the 2D list. When we find the element equal to x, we store its coordinates in a tuple. We then sort this list of tuples.

To sort the tuples, we can use the `sort.Slice` function. This function sorts the elements of a slice given a function that defines the sort order. We define the sort order as first sorting by the first element of each tuple (the row index), and then sorting by the second element of each tuple (
