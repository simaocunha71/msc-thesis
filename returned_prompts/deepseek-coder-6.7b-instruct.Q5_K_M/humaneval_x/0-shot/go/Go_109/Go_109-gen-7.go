        }
    }

    for i := range arr {
        if arr[(i+1)%len(arr)] < arr[i] {
            break
        }

A: The algorithm works by first checking if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order when the array is rotated right. If it is, then it returns true. If not, it then checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order when the array is rotated left. If it is, then it returns true. If neither of these conditions are met, it returns false.

Here is the Python code for the same:

```python
def MoveOneBall(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    if n == 0:
        return True
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > arr[(i+1)%n]:
            break
        if i == n-1:
            return True
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[(i+1)%n] < arr[i]:
            break
        if i == n-1:
            return True
    return False
```
This code works by checking if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order when the array is rotated right or left. If it is, then it returns True. If neither of these conditions are met, it returns False.

The time complexity of this code is O(n) and the space complexity is O(1).

This code is a direct translation of the given problem statement into Python. It first checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order when the array is rotated right. If it is, then it returns True. If not, it then checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order when the array is rotated left. If it is, then it returns True. If neither of these conditions are met, it returns False.
