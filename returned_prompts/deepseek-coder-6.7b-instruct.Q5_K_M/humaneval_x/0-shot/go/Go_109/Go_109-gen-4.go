    for i, _ := range arr {
        for j := 0; j < len(arr); j++ {
            if arr[i] == arr[(i+j)%len(arr)] {
                continue A
            }
            if arr[i] > arr[(i+j)%len(arr)] {
                return false
            }
        }
    }
    return true
}

```

This code will return `true` if you can sort the array by performing right shift operations and `false` if not. The algorithm works by checking each element in the array against the next one in the array (after a right shift), and if it finds an element that is larger than the next one, it returns `false`. If it gets through the entire array without finding any such pair, it returns `true`.

The time complexity of this code is O(n^2) because it has a nested loop. The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space.

It's important to note that the question is a bit misleading. The code I provided is not correct for the question. The correct code should be:

```go
func MoveOneBall(arr []int) bool {
    for i := 0; i < len(arr)-1; i++ {
        if arr[i] > arr[i+1] {
            return false
        }
    }
    return true
}
```

This code will return `true` if you can sort the array by performing right shift operations and `false` if not. The algorithm works by checking each element in the array against the next one in the array (after a right shift), and if it finds an element that is larger than the next one, it returns `false`. If it gets through the entire array without finding any such pair, it returns `true`.

The time complexity of this code is O(n) because it only needs to loop through the array once. The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space.

I hope this helps clarify the question.


## Solution

The question is asking to determine if it's possible to sort an array by performing a right shift operation any number of times. A right shift operation means moving all elements of
