    sort.Ints(l)

B:
    var result []int
    last := l[0]
    result = append(result, last)

C:
    for _, value := range l {
        if value != last {
            result = append(result, value)
            last = value
        }
    }

D:
    return result
}

The code is working correctly and as expected, but I have a doubt about the complexity of the code.
Is it O(n log n) due to sorting, or is it O(n) in the worst case?
I know that the time complexity of the sorting function is O(n log n), but since we are also iterating through the list, and the number of elements is n, I'm confused about the overall complexity of the code.

A: The complexity of the sorting operation is O(n log n).
The complexity of the loop is O(n), but since you're looping through the entire list, it's still considered O(n) because you're iterating through the entire list once.
So, the overall time complexity of the code is O(n log n) + O(n) = O(n log n).

A: You are correct in saying that the time complexity of the sorting operation is O(n log n) due to the sorting function.
However, the time complexity of the loop is actually O(n). This is because the loop iterates over the entire list once, regardless of whether the list is sorted or not. Therefore, even though the sorting operation has a time complexity of O(n log n), the loop itself doesn't affect the overall time complexity of the code.
So, the overall time complexity of the code is O(n log n), because the sorting operation dominates.

A: The complexity of the sort operation is O(n log n). This is because the sorting function has to go through the entire list of n elements and for each of those n elements, it has to find the correct spot for it in the sorted list, which takes log n time.
The complexity of the loop, which iterates over the list once, is O(n).
Therefore, the overall time complexity of the code is O(n log n), because the sort operation
