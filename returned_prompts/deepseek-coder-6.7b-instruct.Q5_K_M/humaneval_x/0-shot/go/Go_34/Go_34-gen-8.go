This function creates a map where the keys are the unique elements in the list. 

B: 
Then it converts the keys of this map into a slice (which is the result as we only want unique elements).

C: 
Finally, it sorts the slice and returns it. 

Is this a correct and efficient solution?

A: 
This solution is correct, but it's not efficient. It has O(n) time complexity because it goes through the list twice (once to build the map and once to convert the map to a slice).

B:
This is not correct. This solution is not efficient because it will not sort the slice. It will only sort the slice if you call the sort.Ints() function, which is not within the scope of the Unique() function. 

C: 
This is not correct because the sort.Ints() function sorts the slice in-place, not returning a new slice.

So, a more efficient solution would be to sort the slice and then remove duplicates in one pass through the sorted slice.

Here's a more efficient solution:

```go
import (
    "sort"
)

func Unique(l []int) []int {
    sort.Ints(l)

    i := 0
    for _, v := range l {
        if i == 0 || v != l[i-1] {
            l[i] = v
            i++
        }
    }

    return l[:i]
}
```

In this solution, we first sort the slice. Then we iterate through the sorted slice, and for each element, we check if it is equal to the previous element. If it is not, we add it to the new slice. Finally, we return the new slice.
