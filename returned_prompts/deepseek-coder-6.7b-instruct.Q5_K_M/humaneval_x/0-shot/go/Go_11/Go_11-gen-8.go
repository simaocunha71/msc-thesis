    for i := 0; i < len(a); i++ {
        if a[i] == '0' && b[i] == '0' {
            a = a[:i] + "0" + a[i+1:]
        } else if a[i] == '1' && b[i] == '1' {
            a = a[:i] + "0" + a[i+1:]

A: 
The answer is wrong, it's not giving correct xor results.

The solution you have provided is not the correct binary XOR operation. It is not performing the XOR operation on the binary strings but on the characters of the strings.

Here is the correct solution:

```go
import (
    "fmt"
)

func StringXor(a string, b string) string {
    var result string
    for i := 0; i < len(a); i++ {
        if a[i] == b[i] {
            result += "0"
        } else {
            result += "1"
        }
    }
    return result
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(StringXor("010", "110")) // Expected output: 100
}
```

In the above code, we are iterating over each character in the string. If the characters are the same, we append '0' to the result string. If they are different, we append '1' to the result string. This is the correct XOR operation for binary strings.

The output of the main function will be "100" as expected.

Note: The lengths of the two input strings should be the same. In your question, it is not mentioned. If they are not the same, you need to pad the shorter string with zeros on the left until they are the same length.

This code will work for inputs of
