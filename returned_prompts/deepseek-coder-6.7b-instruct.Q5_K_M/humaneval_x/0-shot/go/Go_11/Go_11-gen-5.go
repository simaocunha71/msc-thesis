    for i := range a {
        if a[i] != b[i] {
            a[i] = '1'
        } else {
            a[i] = '0'
        }
    }
    return a
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(StringXor("010", "110"))
}


A: The issue with your code is that strings in Go are immutable. You cannot change a string once it's created. You can convert it to a rune slice (a slice of runes, where a rune is a type that represents a Unicode code point) and do the XOR operation on that slice. Here's the corrected code:

```go
import (
    "fmt"
)

func StringXor(a string, b string) string {
    aRunes := []rune(a)
    bRunes := []rune(b)

    for i := range aRunes {
        if aRunes[i] != bRunes[i] {
            aRunes[i] = '1'
        } else {
            aRunes[i] = '0'
        }
    }
    return string(aRunes)
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(StringXor("010", "110"))  // Output: 100
}
```
This code will work for any input strings of equal length. If the strings are of different lengths, you'll need to add additional logic to handle that.

Also, note that this code assumes that the input strings are of the same length. If that's not the case, you'll need to add error handling to deal with the situation.



A: You can't modify a string directly in Go, because strings are immutable. You need to convert the string to a rune array, which is a slice of runes, and then you can modify the runes. Here is the corrected code:

```go
import (
    "fmt"
)

func StringXor(a string, b string) string {
    aRunes := []rune(a)
