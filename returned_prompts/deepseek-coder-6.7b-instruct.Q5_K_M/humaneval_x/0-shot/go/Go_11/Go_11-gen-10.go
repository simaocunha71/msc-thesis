A: The above code is not working as expected because it is performing binary XOR on two binary strings and replacing the bits of the first string with the result of the XOR operation. However, the result should be a new string that is the result of the XOR operation on the two input strings.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strconv"
)

func StringXor(a string, b string) string {
	var xorResult string
	for i := 0; i < len(a); i++ {
		// Convert each character to an integer
		numA, _ := strconv.Atoi(string(a[i]))
		numB, _ := strconv.Atoi(string(b[i]))

		// Perform XOR operation and convert result to string
		xorDigit := strconv.Itoa(numA ^ numB)
		xorResult += xorDigit
	}
	return xorResult
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(StringXor("010", "110")) // Outputs: 100
}
```

In this corrected code, we iterate over each character in the input strings. We convert these characters to integers, perform the XOR operation, and then convert the result back to a string. We append these results to `xorResult`, which is returned at the end. This approach correctly performs the XOR operation on the two binary strings.

Please note that this code assumes that the input strings `a` and `b` are of the same length and that they only contain '0's and '1
