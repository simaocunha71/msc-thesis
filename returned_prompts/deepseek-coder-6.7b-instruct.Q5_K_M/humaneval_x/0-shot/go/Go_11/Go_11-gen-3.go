    for i := 0; i < len(a); i++ {
        if a[i] == b[i] {
            fmt.Print("0")
        } else {
            fmt.Print("1")
        }
    }
    return ""
}

This code is supposed to perform XOR operation on two binary strings. 
The code compares each bit of the two input strings. If the bits are equal it prints "0", otherwise it prints "1". 
The function does not return anything so the return statement is unnecessary.

A: The function is supposed to return the result of the XOR operation, not print it. The result should be concatenated into a string and returned. Here's a corrected version:

```go
func StringXor(a string, b string) string {
    var result string
    for i := 0; i < len(a); i++ {
        if a[i] == b[i] {
            result += "0"
        } else {
            result += "1"
        }
    }
    return result
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(StringXor("010", "110"))  // Outputs: 100
}
```

This version of the function loops over the characters in `a` and `b`, comparing the corresponding characters. If the characters are the same, it appends "0" to `result`, otherwise it appends "1". Finally, it returns `result`.

In the `main` function, the result of `StringXor("010", "110")` is printed to the console.

This code assumes that `a` and `b` have the same length. If they do not, you should add code to handle the case where `b` is shorter than
