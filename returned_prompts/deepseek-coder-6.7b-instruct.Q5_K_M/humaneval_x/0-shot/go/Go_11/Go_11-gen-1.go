            return "Inputs are of different lengths"
        }
    }

    result := ""

B:
    for i := 0; i < len(a); i++ {
        if a[i] == b[i] {
            result += "0"
        } else {
            result += "1"
        }
    }

    return result
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(StringXor("010", "110"))
}


A: The problem in your code is that you are not handling the cases where the length of the strings a and b are different. In the XOR operation, the shorter string is padded with zeros from the left until it has the same length as the longer string.

You should check if the strings are of the same length. If they are not, you should pad the shorter string with zeros from the left until they have the same length.

Here is the corrected code:

```go
import (
    "fmt"
    "strings"
)

func StringXor(a string, b string) string {
    // Calculate the length of the shorter string
    n := len(a)
    if len(b) < n {
        n = len(b)
    }

    // Pad the shorter string with zeros from the left until they have the same length
    a = strings.Repeat("0", n-len(a)) + a
    b = strings.Repeat("0", n-len(b)) + b

    result := ""
    for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
        if a[i] == b[i] {
            result += "0"
        } else {
            result += "1"
        }
    }

    return result
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(StringXor("010", "110")) // Output: 100
}
```

This code will correctly perform the XOR operation on the binary strings a and b.
