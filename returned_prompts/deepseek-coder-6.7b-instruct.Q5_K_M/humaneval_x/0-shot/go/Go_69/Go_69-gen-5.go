This program works by first creating a map to count the frequency of each integer in the list. Then, it loops from the maximum value in the list down to 1, checking if the frequency of the current number is greater than or equal to the number itself. If it is, the function returns the number. If no such number is found after checking all values, the function returns -1.

Here is the output of the program:

```
2
3
-1
```

Which matches the expected outputs in the examples.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) because it makes one pass over the list to count the frequencies, and another pass to find the maximum value in the list. The space complexity is O(n) because it uses a map to store the frequencies.

**Note:** This solution assumes that the input list only contains positive integers. If negative integers or zero could be in the list, additional error checking should be added to handle those cases.

**Note:** This solution assumes that the input list is not empty. If an empty list could be provided, additional error checking should be added to handle that case.
