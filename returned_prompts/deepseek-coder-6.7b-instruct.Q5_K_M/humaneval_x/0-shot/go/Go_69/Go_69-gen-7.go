This problem is a little tricky, because we have to find a number that has a frequency that is greater than or equal to its value. The first thing to notice is that if we sort the array, the number with the highest frequency will be at the end of the array. Then we can just start from the end of the array and count the frequency of each number.

In the end, we return the maximum number that meets the criteria, or -1 if no such number exists.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, and the space complexity is O(1) as we only use a constant amount of space.

Note that this solution assumes that the input list is not empty and contains only positive integers.

This solution also handles the edge case where the maximum frequency number is the first number in the array.

The code is written in Go, which is a statically typed, compiled language with a syntax that's similar to C. It's known for its efficiency and ease of use in concurrent programming.

The use of `sort.Ints(lst)` is a built-in function from the Go standard library that sorts an array of integers in place.

The `for` loop iterates over the sorted array from the end to the start, comparing each number with the next one. If the current number is equal to the next one, it increments the count; if it's less, it resets the count. If the current number is greater than the count and greater than the maximum found so far, it updates the maximum.

Finally, if the count
