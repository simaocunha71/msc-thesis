## Code Review

1. The code first sorts the input list `lst` in ascending order. This is necessary because it makes it easier to count the frequency of numbers in `lst`.

2. Then it creates a map `counter` that will store the frequency of each number in `lst`. 

3. Afterwards, it iterates over the sorted list in reverse order. This is because we want to return the greatest integer that has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself. If we iterated over the list in ascending order, we would skip over integers that have a frequency less than their value.

4. For each integer `i` in the list, it checks if `i` is a key in `counter` and if the corresponding value is greater than or equal to `i`. If both conditions are met, it returns `i`.

5. If no such `i` is found after checking all integers in the list, the function returns `-1`.

This function runs in O(n log n) time due to the sorting step, where n is the length of `lst`. The rest of the function runs in O(n) time. Therefore, the total time complexity is O(n log n).

## Test Cases

```
assert(Search([4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]) == 2)
assert(Search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) == 3)
assert(Search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]) == -1)
```

## Possible Improvements

One possible improvement would be to use a more efficient data structure for counting the frequency of numbers
