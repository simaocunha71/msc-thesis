This program will return the greatest integer that is greater than zero, and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself. If no such a value exist, return -1.

Here is how it works:

1. It first sorts the input list in descending order.
2. It then iterates through the sorted list and checks if the frequency of the current number is greater than or equal to the value of the number itself.
3. If it is, it returns the number.
4. If no such number is found after iterating through the entire list, it returns -1.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, and a space complexity of O(1) as it only uses a constant amount of space.

Please note that this solution assumes that the input list is a non-empty list of positive integers. If this
