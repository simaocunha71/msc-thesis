### Explanation

In this problem, we have to find the greatest integer that has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself. If no such a value exist, return -1. 

The algorithm works as follows:

1. Sort the input list.
2. Create a map to count the frequency of each number in the list.
3. Iterate over the list in reverse order and check if the frequency of the current number is greater than the value of the number itself.
4. If yes, return the number.
5. If not, continue to the next number.
6. If no such number is found after iterating over the entire list, return -1.

This algorithm ensures that we find the greatest possible number that meets the criteria, because we're iterating over the list in reverse order.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, and the space complexity is O(n) for storing the frequency count in the map.

### Test Cases

```go
func main() {
    fmt.Println(Search([]int{4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1})) // Expected: 2
    fmt.Println(Search([]int{1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4})) // Expected: 3
    fmt.Println(Search([]int{5, 5, 4, 4, 4})) // Expected: -1
}
```

## Solution 2 (Python)

```python
def Search(lst):
    from collections import Counter

    counter = Counter(lst)
    max_val = max(counter
