The function `Derivative` calculates the derivative of a polynomial. It takes a slice of integers `xs` representing the coefficients of the polynomial. The first element of the `xs` slice corresponds to the constant term and the i-th element corresponds to the coefficient of the x^i term. The function returns a new slice with the coefficients of the derivative of the polynomial.

The logic of the function is to iterate over the `xs` slice starting from the second element (index 1), multiply the coefficient of the term by the power of x (which is the index of the term) and store the result in the corresponding index in the `result` slice.

Finally, the `result` slice is returned by the function. The length of the `result` slice is one less than the length of the `xs` slice, because the derivative of a constant is always 0, and the constant term is not included in the `xs` slice.

This is a simple implementation of the function and it assumes that the input is always a valid polynomial. In a more complex implementation, you might want to add error checking to ensure that the input is a valid polynomial.


```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func Derivative(xs []int) []int {
    length := len(xs)
    result := make([]int, length-1)

    for i := 1; i < length; i++ {
        result[i-1] = xs[i] * i
    }

    return result
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(Derivative([]int{3, 1, 2, 4, 5})) // Output: [1 4 12 20]
    fmt.Println(Derivative([]int{1, 2, 3}))        // Output: [2 6]
}
```

This program will output:
