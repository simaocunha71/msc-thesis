This program calculates the derivative of a polynomial by taking the product of each coefficient and its position in the original polynomial. The first coefficient (which is the constant term of the original polynomial) is ignored because the derivative of a constant is zero.

Here is the Go code for the same problem:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func Derivative(xs []int) []int {

    if len(xs) <= 1 {
        return make([]int, 0)
    }

    derivative := make([]int, len(xs) - 1)

    for i := 1; i < len(xs); i++ {
        derivative[i-1] = xs[i] * i
    }

    return derivative
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(Derivative([]int{3, 1, 2, 4, 5})) // Output: [1 4 12 20]
    fmt.Println(Derivative([]int{1, 2, 3})) // Output: [2 6]
}
```

In the main function, we call the Derivative function with a slice of coefficients for a polynomial. The function returns a slice of coefficients representing the derivative of the polynomial.

The output of this program is the same as the one in the question.

This program could be used to calculate the derivative of a polynomial in a mathematical
