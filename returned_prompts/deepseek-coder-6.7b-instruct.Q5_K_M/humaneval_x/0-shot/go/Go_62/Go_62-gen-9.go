// Test cases
func main() {
	fmt.Println(Derivative([]int{3, 1, 2, 4, 5})) // [1, 4, 12, 20]

In this program, we create a new slice to store the result. We then iterate through each term in the input polynomial, skipping the first term (since its derivative would be zero). For each term, we multiply its coefficient by its exponent (which is its index in the input slice, plus one, since we're working with 0-based indexing), and append this to our result slice. Finally, we return the result slice.

The time complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the length of the input slice. This is because we perform a constant amount of work for each term in the input slice. The space complexity is also O(n), because we create a new slice to store the result.
