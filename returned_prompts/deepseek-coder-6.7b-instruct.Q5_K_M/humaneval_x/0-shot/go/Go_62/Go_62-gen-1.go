#### Answer

The function `Derivative` calculates the derivative of a given polynomial by multiplying each coefficient with its corresponding exponent and then removing the first coefficient (which is the constant term in the derivative).

The code creates a new slice `derivative` of length one less than the input slice `xs`. Then, it iterates over the `xs` slice from the second element (index 1) to the end, multiplying each coefficient `x[i]` by `i` (its index) and storing the result in the `derivative[i-1]` position.

Finally, it returns the `derivative` slice.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input slice `xs`.

Here is the Python version of the code:

```python
def Derivative(xs):
    return [i*xs[i] for i in range(1, len(xs))]
```

This Python function does the same thing as the Go function. It creates a new list by iterating over the input list from the second element to the end, multiplying each element by its index and adding the result to the new list. The function then returns the new list.

The time complexity of this Python function is also O(n).

Both of these functions work correctly with the examples provided in the question.

```go
fmt.Println(Derivative([]int{3, 1, 2, 4, 5}))  // Output: [0 4 12 20]
fmt.Println(Derivative([]int{1, 2, 3}))  // Output: [2 6]
```

```python
print(Derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5]))  # Output: [0, 4, 12, 20]
print(Derivative([1, 2, 3]))  # Output:
