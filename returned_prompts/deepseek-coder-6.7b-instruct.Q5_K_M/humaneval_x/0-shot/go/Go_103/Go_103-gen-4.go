## Answer

The time complexity of this code is O(1), which means the time it takes to run doesn't change with the size of the input data. The space complexity is O(1), which means the memory used by the program doesn't change with the size of the input data.

The improvements could be to remove the unnecessary labels and comments, and to ensure that the code is properly formatted. It could also be beneficial to add a check to ensure that n and m are positive integers.

The code itself appears to be well-written and efficient. It handles the edge case where n > m by returning -1, calculates the rounded average of n and m, and then converts that average to a binary string.

```go
import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

func RoundedAvg(n, m int) interface{} {
	if n > m {
		return -1
	}
	avg := math.Round(float64(n+m) / 2)
	return fmt.Sprintf("%b", int(avg))
}
```

This code could be improved by ensuring that n and m are positive integers. This could be done by adding a check at the beginning of the function that returns an error if n > m. Also, the labels and comments are not necessary and could be removed to make the code more readable.

```go
import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

func RoundedAvg(n, m int) interface{} {
	if n > m {
		return -1
	}
	avg := math.Round(float64(n+m) / 2)
	return fmt.Sprintf("%b", int(avg))
}
```

The time complexity is O(1), which means the time it takes to run doesn't
