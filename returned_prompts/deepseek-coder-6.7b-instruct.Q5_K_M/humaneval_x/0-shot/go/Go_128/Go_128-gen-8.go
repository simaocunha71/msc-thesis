// The problem's description is a bit confusing as it states that the function needs to return the sum of magnitudes of integers multiplied by the product of all signs of each number in the array, represented by 1, -1 or 0. However, the given example is showing the opposite. It seems like the function should return the sum of the absolute values of the integers multiplied by the product of their signs, not the sum of magnitudes.

// Also, the function should return nil for an empty array, not 0.

// In the given example, ProdSigns([1, 2, 2, -4]) should return -9, not 9. And ProdSigns([0, 1]) should return 0, not nil.

// I've corrected these issues in the code.

// This function works by first initializing the total to 0 and the product to 1. Then it iterates over each number in the array. If the number is negative, it multiplies the product by -1. If the number is positive, it leaves the product as is. If the number is 0, it returns 0. After that, it adds the absolute value of the number to the total. Finally, it returns the product multiplied by the total.
