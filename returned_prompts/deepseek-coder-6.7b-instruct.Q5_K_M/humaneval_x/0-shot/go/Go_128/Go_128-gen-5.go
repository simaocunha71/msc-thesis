    if len(arr) == 0 {

}

func main() {
    arr := []int{1, 2, 2, -4}
    fmt.Println(ProdSigns(arr)) // -9
    arr = []int{0, 1}
    fmt.Println(ProdSigns(arr)) // 0
    arr = []int{}
    fmt.Println(ProdSigns(arr)) // nil
}
```

**Output:**

```
-9
0
<nil>
```

This solution works by first checking if the array is empty. If it is, it returns `nil`. It then initializes `total` to 0 and `sign` to 1.

Next, it iterates over each number in the array. If the number is negative, it multiplies `sign` by -1. If the number is positive, it leaves `sign` as is. If the number is 0, it immediately returns 0.

It then adds the absolute value of the number to `total`.

Finally, it returns `total * sign`.

In the main function, it tests `ProdSigns` with different inputs to verify it works as expected.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), where n is the length of the array.

This problem can be solved in many ways, and this solution is one of them.

**Note:** The problem statement is not entirely clear. It seems like the problem requires a solution that works with an array of integers. However, in the examples provided, the input is a slice of signed integers (`[]int`). If the problem statement is indeed correct, then this solution should work. If the problem statement is incorrect, please provide the correct problem statement so
