    res := make([]int, len(game))
    for i := range game {
        res[i] = int(math.Abs(float6(game[i] - guess[i])))
    }
    return res
}
```

This code is written in Go and checks the difference between the scores of the matches and the guesses. It iterates over the length of the game array and calculates the absolute difference between the corresponding elements in the game and guess arrays. This result is then added to the result array. This result array is returned at the end of the function. 

This code is correct and will run as expected. It takes in two slices of integers and returns a slice of integers with the absolute differences between corresponding elements from the two input slices.

Please note that the 'float6' used in the code is not defined, it should be 'float64' to represent the float64 type in Go.

Here's the corrected code:
