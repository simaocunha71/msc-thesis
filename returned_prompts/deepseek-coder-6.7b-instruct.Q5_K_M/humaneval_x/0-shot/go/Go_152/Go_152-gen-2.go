    
    result := make([]int, len(game))
    for i := 0; i < len(game); i++ {
        result[i] = int(math.Abs(float6l(game[i] - guess[i])))
    }
    return result
}

Error:
main.go:12:6: syntax error: unexpected int, expecting semicolon or newline or }
main.go:13:6: syntax error: unexpected float6l, expecting semicolon or newline or }
main.go:13:19: undefined: float6l
main.go:14:2: syntax error: unexpected }

What have I done wrong?

A: You have some syntax errors and typos in your code.

Here is the corrected version:

```go
import  (
    "math"
)

func Compare(game, guess []int) []int {
    result := make([]int, len(game))
    for i := 0; i < len(game); i++ {
        result[i] = int(math.Abs(float64(game[i] - guess[i])))
    }
    return result
}
```

Explanation:

1. Replace `float6l` with `float64`.
2. Add `(` before `float64(`.
3. Add `)` after `float64(game[i] - guess[i])`.
4. Replace `}` with `)` at the end of the function.

This should resolve the syntax error you were encountering.

Note: As you asked in the question, I assumed that you want to calculate the absolute difference between the game and guess arrays. If not, then the logic may need to be modified accordingly.


A: The issue is in your import statement and the use of float6l in your code.

*

*In the import statement, the package name is math and it should not have any spaces, so it should be "math".

*The function math.Abs() requires a float64 as input, so you need to convert game[i] - guess[i] to float64.
