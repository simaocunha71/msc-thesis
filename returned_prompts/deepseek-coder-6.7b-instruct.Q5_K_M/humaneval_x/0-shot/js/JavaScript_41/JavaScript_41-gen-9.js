/*
  The function carRaceCollision takes an integer n as input, representing the number

  The formula for the number of collisions is n*n, because every left-going car will collide
  with every right-going car.

//Testing the function
console.log(carRaceCollision(10)); //Outputs: 100



/*
  This function tests the carRaceCollision function using a set of 10 cars.
  The expected output is 100, because there are 10 cars moving left to right and 10 cars
  moving right to left, and for every left-going car there are 10 right-going cars.
  Hence, there are 10*10=100 collisions.

## Explanation

This problem involves understanding the concept of simultaneous collision in two moving directions. For each left-going car, there are n right-going cars that will collide with it. Hence, the total number of collisions is the square of the number of cars, i.e., n*n.

## Solution

Here is the solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
const carRaceCollision = (n) => {
  return n * n;
};

console.log(carRaceCollision(10)); // Outputs: 100
```

This solution simply multiplies the number of cars moving in one direction by the number of cars moving in the other direction. This gives the total number of collisions.

## Testing

You can test the function by calling it with different values of n. Here is an example:

```javascript
console.log(carRaceCollision(5)); // Outputs: 25
console.log(carRaceCollision(10)); // Outputs: 100
console.log(carRaceCollision(20)); // Outputs: 400
```

These tests check the function with different numbers of cars moving in opposite directions. The expected outputs are the squares of the input numbers.
