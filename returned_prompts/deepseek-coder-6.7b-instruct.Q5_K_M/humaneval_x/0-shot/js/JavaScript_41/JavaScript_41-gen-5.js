  // In this function, we will calculate the number of collisions by calculating the
  // sum of all possible pairs of cars that collide.
  // There are n cars moving left to right and n cars moving right to left.
  // So, for each car moving left to right, there are n cars moving right to left that it can collide with.
  // Therefore, the total number of collisions is n * n.

  return n * n;

console.log(carRaceCollision(5))  // Output: 25
console.log(carRaceCollision(10))  // Output: 100
```

In this code, we're using a simple arithmetic expression to calculate the number of collisions. The number of collisions is equal to the square of the number of cars because each car will collide with every other car. This is a mathematical property of the problem.

The function `carRaceCollision` takes one parameter `n` which is the number of cars moving in opposite directions. It returns the total number of collisions that will occur between these cars.

Here, we're using the JavaScript arrow function syntax. Arrow functions provide a concise syntax to write function expressions. The function takes one parameter `n` and returns the result of the multiplication of `n` by itself which is the total number of collisions.

The `console.log()` function is used to print the output of the function `carRaceCollision`.

This function will work for any positive integer input `n` and will return the correct number of collisions.

Please note that this function does not account for the possibility of cars moving in parallel or at the same speed, as per the problem statement. If cars are moving at the same speed, no collisions will occur. The function assumes that the cars are moving at different speeds.

This function can be used in a larger program or script to simulate or model a car race scenario.
