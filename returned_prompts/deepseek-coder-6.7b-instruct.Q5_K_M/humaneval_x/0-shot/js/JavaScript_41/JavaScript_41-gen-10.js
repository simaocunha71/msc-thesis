// This function calculates the total number of pairs of cars that could collide,
// then subtracts the number of pairs that would collide if they were on opposite sides of the road.
// The result is the number of pairs that actually collide.

// The total number of pairs of cars is n*n, where n is the number of cars.
// The number of pairs that collide if they are on opposite sides of the road is also n*n.
// Therefore, the number of actual collisions is the total number of pairs minus the number of pairs on opposite sides.

// The reason we subtract the number of pairs on opposite sides is because these pairs would collide if they were on opposite sides of the road.
// However, because they are moving in opposite directions, they continue moving in their original directions without colliding.
// Therefore, we only need to count the actual collisions, which is the total number of pairs minus the number of pairs on opposite sides.

// This is a mathematical solution and does not require any complex computational steps.
// The time complexity of this function is O(1), which means it takes constant time to compute the result.
// The space complexity of this function is O(1), which means it uses constant space to store the result.

// This function works for any value of n, including positive, negative, and zero.
// However, if n is a negative number or zero, the function will return a negative number or zero, respectively.
// This is because there cannot be a negative or zero number of cars, so the function will return an incorrect result if n is negative or zero.
