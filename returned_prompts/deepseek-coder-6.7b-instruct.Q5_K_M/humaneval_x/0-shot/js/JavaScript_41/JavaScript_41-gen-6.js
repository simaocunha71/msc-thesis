  /*
  The logic here is that for each car moving left to right, there will be exactly n cars moving right to left
  that it will collide with.  Hence, the total number of collisions is n*n.
  */
  return n * n;
}

console.log(carRaceCollision(5)); // 25
console.log(carRaceCollision(10)); // 100
```

The logic in this function is to find the number of collisions, which is the product of the number of cars moving left to right and the number of cars moving right to left.

Please note that the complexity of this function is O(1), which means it takes constant time to execute.
