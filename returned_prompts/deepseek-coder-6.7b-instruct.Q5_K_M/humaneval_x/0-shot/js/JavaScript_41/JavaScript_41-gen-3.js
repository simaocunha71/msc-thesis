Explanation:
In this problem, we are asked to calculate the total number of collisions that will occur between n number of cars moving in opposite directions. Each car moving to the right will collide with each car moving to the left. Hence, for any given car moving to the right, there will be n collisions (where n is the number of cars moving left). Therefore, the total number of collisions will be n * n.

This is a simple mathematical problem, where we use the principle of multiplication to find the total number of collisions.

The function takes in one parameter n (the number of cars moving in opposite directions), and returns the total number of collisions.

The time complexity of this function is O(1), which means it runs in constant time, no matter the size of n. This is because the calculation is a simple mathematical operation that doesn't depend on the size of n.

The space complexity of this function is also O(1), because it uses a constant amount of space to store the input and output.

This function is a perfect example of a linear time complexity function.
