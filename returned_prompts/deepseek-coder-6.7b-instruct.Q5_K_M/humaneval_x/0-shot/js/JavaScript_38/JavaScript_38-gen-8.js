A: Your code has a couple of issues.

*

*Variable names cannot include special characters.

*The variable names you are using are not descriptive.

*There are two different versions of the same function with the same name.

*There is a typo in your code where you use the wrong variable in the for loop.

*There is no need to use the Math.floor() function in this case.

*It is not necessary to use const in the second function.

*There is a misuse of the ternary operator in the second function.

*The code has a lot of unnecessary comments and spaces.

Here is the corrected code:

const encodeCyclic = (s) => {
  var groups = [], groups2 = [];
  for(let i = 0; i < s.length / 3; i++) {
    groups.push(s.slice(3 * i, (3 * i + 3) > s.length ? s.length : (3 * i + 3)));
  }
  for(const group of groups) {
    groups2.push(group.slice(1) + group[0]);
  }
  return groups2.join('');
}

const decodeCyclic = (s) => {
  var groups = [], groups2 = [];
  for(let i = 0; i < s.length / 3; i++) {
    groups2.push(s.slice(3 * i, (3 * i + 3
