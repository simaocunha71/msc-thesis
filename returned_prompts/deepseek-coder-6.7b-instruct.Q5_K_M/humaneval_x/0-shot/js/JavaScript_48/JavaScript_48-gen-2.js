  const reversedText = text.split('').reverse().join('');
  return text === reversedText;
};

console.log(isPalindrome('')); // true
console.log(isPalindrome('aba')); // true
console.log(isPalindrome('aaaaa')); // true
console.log(isPalindrome('zbcd')); // false
```

This solution works by first splitting the input string into an array of characters with `split('')`, then reversing that array with `reverse()`, and finally joining the reversed array back into a string with `join('')`. It then compares the reversed string to the original, returning `true` if they are the same, `false` otherwise.

It is important to note that this solution assumes that the input string is in lower case and does not contain any special characters. If these conditions are not met, additional checks may need to be added to handle those cases.

This solution also assumes that the input string will not be very large, as it uses a linear amount of space to store the reversed string. If the input string could be very large, a different approach would be needed to avoid using up too much memory.

This solution also assumes that the input string will be a valid string, that is, it will not be `null` or `undefined`. If this is not guaranteed, you should add error checking to handle these cases.

## Additional Notes:

This solution is case sensitive, meaning it will return false for 'Aba' because 'A' is not equal to 'a'. If you want to make it case insensitive, you could convert the input to lower case or upper case before checking if it is a palindrome.

This solution does not handle strings with leading or trailing spaces. If you want to ignore leading or trailing spaces, you could remove them before checking if the string is a palindrome.

This solution does not handle strings with special characters. If you want to ignore special characters, you could remove them before checking if the string is a palindrome.

This solution assumes that the input string is not `null` or `undefined`. If the input string could be `null` or `undefined`, you should check for these cases before checking if the string is a palindrome.
