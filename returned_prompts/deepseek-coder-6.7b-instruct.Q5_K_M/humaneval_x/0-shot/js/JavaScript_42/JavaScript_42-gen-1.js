return l.map(e => e + 1);

};

console.log(incrList([1, 2, 3]));
console.log(incrList([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]));

```

Here is a simple JavaScript function that takes in a list and returns a list with all the elements incremented by 1. 

The function uses the JavaScript `.map()` method, which applies a given function to each item in an array, and returns a new array with the results.

```javascript
const incrList = (l) => {
return l.map(e => e + 1);
};
```

The `e => e + 1` is an arrow function that takes in an element `e` and returns `e + 1`. 

This arrow function is passed to the `.map()` method, which applies it to each item in the input list `l`. The result is a new array where each element is the result of the function applied to the corresponding element of `l`.

So if you call `incrList([1, 2, 3])`, it will return `[2, 3, 4]`, and if you call `incrList([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])`, it will return `[6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]`.
