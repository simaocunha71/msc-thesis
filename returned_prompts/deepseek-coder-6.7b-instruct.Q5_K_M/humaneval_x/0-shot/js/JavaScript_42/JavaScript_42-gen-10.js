  return l.map(x => x+1);
};

module.exports = incrList;
```

This code defines a function `incrList` that takes a list `l` as an argument and returns a new list with the same length, but with each element incremented by 1. The `map` function is used to apply a function (in this case, `x => x + 1`) to each element of the list, and returns a new list with the results.

The function `incrList` is then exported so that it can be used in other modules.

Here is the test code:

```javascript
const incrList = require('./incrList');

console.log(incrList([1, 2, 3])); // [2, 3, 4]
console.log(incrList([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])); // [6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]
```

In this test code, the `incrList` function is used to increment the elements of the provided lists, and the results are logged to the console.

This code is a simple and efficient way to solve the problem. It uses JavaScript's built-in `map` function to transform the input list.

Note: The `require` function used in the test code is Node.js specific. If you're using this code in a browser environment, you'll need to use a different method to import the `incrList` function, such as `import` or `script` tags.

Also, it's important to note that this code assumes that the input list `l` is an array of numbers. If you pass a non-array value to `incrList`, it will throw an error.

This function is case sensitive. It will return the same result if you pass 'a', 'b' or 'c' instead of 1, 2, or 3.

It is also important to note that the function will not work as expected with other data types like strings or objects.

In JavaScript, it's a good practice to add comments to
