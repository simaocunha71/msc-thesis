return l.map(el => el + 1)
}


A: The question is asking to create a function that takes a list (array) and returns a new list where each element is incremented by one.

In JavaScript, you can use the map() function, which creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the array.

Here's an implementation:

```javascript
function incrList(l) {
    return l.map(el => el + 1);
}
```

You can use this function like so:

```javascript
console.log(incrList([1, 2, 3])); // Outputs: [2, 3, 4]
console.log(incrList([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])); // Outputs: [6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]
```

In this solution, the map() function takes a callback function that takes an element of the array and returns the element incremented by one. The map() function returns a new array with these transformed elements.

You should note that the function uses an arrow function syntax (el => el + 1) to define the callback. This is a shorter way of writing a function that takes a single argument and returns the argument incremented by one.

If you want a version with the function declarations style:

```javascript
const incrList = (l) => {
    return l.map(el => el + 1);
}
```

Or even shorter:

```javascript
const incrList = l => l.map(el => el + 1);
```

These versions do the same thing as the previous ones, but use different syntax.


A: Here's a Python solution:

```python
def incrList(l):
    return [el + 1 for el in l]
```

This solution uses a list comprehension to create a new list. The expression `el + 1` inside the list comprehension is applied to each element in the input list `l`.

You can use this function like so:
