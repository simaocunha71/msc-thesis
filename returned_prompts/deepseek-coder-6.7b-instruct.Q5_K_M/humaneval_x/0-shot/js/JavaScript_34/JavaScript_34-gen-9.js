  return [...new Set(l.sort((a, b) => a - b))];
}

console.log(unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]));

The function unique takes a list as an argument and returns a new list that contains only the unique elements from the original list. The Set object lets you store unique values of any type. Itâ€™s great to use when you need to remove duplicates from an array.

In sort function (a, b) => a - b), we are sorting the array in ascending order.

Finally, we use the spread operator (...) to return the elements of the Set as an array.
