// The code first splits the fractions into their numerator and denominator.
// It then checks if the product of the numerators and the product of the denominators are equal.
// If they are, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.
// This is because multiplying two fractions together will simplify them if and only if the product
// of their numerators is equal to the product of their denominators.

// This solution assumes that the inputs are always valid fractions.
// If the inputs could be invalid, you would need to add error checking to handle those cases.

// This solution also assumes that the inputs will always be two fractions.
// If the inputs could be a single number or some other type of data, you would need to modify the solution to handle those cases.

// This solution uses JavaScript's arrow function syntax, which is a more concise way to write functions.
// It also uses the map function to convert the numerator and denominator strings to numbers.
// It uses the === operator to compare the products of the numerators and denominators.
// It uses the split function to split the fractions into their numerator and denominator.
// It uses the const keyword to declare the simplify function.
// It uses the console.log function to log the results of the simplify function.
// It uses the template literal syntax to create the strings for the numerators and denominators.

// This solution is efficient because it only needs to perform a few arithmetic operations and a few string operations.
// It has a time complexity of O(1), which means it always takes the same amount of time to run, regardless of the size of the input.
// It has a space complexity of O(1), which means it always uses the same amount of space to
