The function `isEqualToSumEven` takes an integer `n` as an argument and checks if `n` can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. If `n` is less than 10 or is odd, the function immediately returns `false`. Then it loops through all even numbers from 2 to n/2 (as larger even numbers will definitely exceed the sum of 4 positive even numbers) and checks if `i` and `n-i` are both even. If they are, the function returns `true`, indicating that `n` can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. If no pair of numbers satisfies the condition, the function returns `false`.

Note: This function assumes that `n` is a positive integer. If `n` can be negative or a non-integer, the function must be modified accordingly.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n/2) = O(n), because in the worst case, it loops through half of the numbers up to n. It has a space complexity of O(1), because it uses a fixed amount of space to store the variables i and n.
