The function `isEqualToSumEven` checks if the number `n` can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. It does this by checking if `n` is greater than or equal to 8 and if it is an even number. If both conditions are true, the function returns `true`, indicating that `n` can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. If either condition is not met, the function returns `false`.

The function is then tested with various inputs to verify its correctness.

The function assumes that the input is a non-negative integer. If negative numbers or non-integer values are possible inputs, the function will need to be adjusted accordingly.

The function is also assuming that the "exactly 4 positive even numbers" sum is always required, which may not be the case. If this is not the case, the function will need to be adjusted accordingly.

The function is also assuming that the "sum" is being calculated in the most straightforward way, which is adding the numbers together. If a different calculation, such as multiplying them, is being used, the function will need to be adjusted accordingly.

The function is assuming that the "4 positive even numbers" are being chosen in a specific way, which may not be the case. If different numbers or different rules are being used to choose the numbers, the function will need to be adjusted accordingly.

The function is assuming that the "exactly 4" part of the problem means that exactly 4 numbers are being used, which may not be the case. If a different number of numbers is being used, the function will need to be adjusted accordingly.

The function is assuming that the "positive"
