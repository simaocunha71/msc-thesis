// The function checks if all three numbers are integers and if any one of them is equal to the sum of the other two.

```

This code will return true if the sum of any two numbers equals the third number and all numbers are integers. It returns false in any other case.

It first checks if all three inputs are numbers. If not, it returns false. Then it checks if any one number equals the sum of the other two, and if so, it returns true. In all other cases, it returns false.

The `typeof` operator is used to check the type of a variable. It returns a string indicating the type of the unevaluated operand.

The `===` operator is a comparison operator that checks if the value of two operands are equal or not. If they are equal, the condition becomes true.

The `||` operator is a logical OR operator. It returns true if either one of the operands is true.

The `console.log` function is used to print the return value of the function to the console.
