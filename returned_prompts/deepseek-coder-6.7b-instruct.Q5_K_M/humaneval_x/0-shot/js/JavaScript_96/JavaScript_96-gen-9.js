A: The function isPrime is correct and it checks whether a number is prime or not.
In your main function countUpTo you are correctly iterating from 2 to n-1 and for each number, you are checking whether it is prime or not. If it is prime, you are pushing it to the array.

Finally, you are returning the array with all the prime numbers found.

So, your function is correct.

A: The function isPrime checks whether a given number is prime by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number and checking for divisibility. If the number is divisible by any of these, it isn't prime, so the function returns false. If the number isn't divisible by any of these, it is prime, so the function returns true.

In your main function countUpTo, you iterate from 2 to n-1 (since we're looking for primes less than n, not including n itself), and for each number, you check whether it's prime. If it is, you push it to the primeArray. Finally,
