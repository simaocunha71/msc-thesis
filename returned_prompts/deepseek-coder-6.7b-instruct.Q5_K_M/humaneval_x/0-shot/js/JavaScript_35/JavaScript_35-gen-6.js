A: The given JavaScript function maxElement will return the maximum element from the provided array.

Here's the explanation:

1. We first initialize a variable max with a value of -Infinity, so that any real number in the array will be greater than it.

2. We then create a for loop that will iterate over each element in the array.

3. Inside the loop, we have a conditional statement that checks if the current element in the array is greater than the current max value.

4. If it is, then max will be updated with the new higher number.

5. After the loop has finished iterating over the array, max will hold the maximum value from the array.

6. Finally, we return max.

The console.log statements are used to test the function with various arrays to verify it works as expected.

This is a simple but effective way to find the maximum element in an array.

Please note that this function assumes that the array will always contain at least one element. If the array can be empty, then you would need to add an additional check at the start of the function to handle this case.

Also note that this function uses the JavaScript Array.prototype.reduce method, which is another way to find the maximum element in an array. This would look something like this:

```javascript
const maxElement = (l) => Math.max(...l);
```

This works by taking the spread operator (...) to break up the array into individual elements, and then passing them into the Math.max function, which returns the highest value.

Both methods achieve the same result and have the same time complexity (O(n)). However, the second method is more concise and arguably more readable.

```javascript
