  const min = Math.min(...numbers);
  const max = Math.max(...numbers);

In the rescaleToUnit function, we first find the min and max of the numbers list. We then find the range of the numbers by subtracting the min from the max. Finally, we map through the numbers list and for each number, we subtract the min and divide by the range. This gives us a new list where each number is transformed so that the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1.

A: Here is the corrected version of your code:

```javascript
const rescaleToUnit = (numbers) => {
  const min = Math.min(...numbers);
  const max = Math.max(...numbers);
  const range = max - min;

  return numbers.map(num => (num - min) / range);
};

console.log(rescaleToUnit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0])); // [0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1]
```

The error in your code was caused by incorrect spacing in the arrow function, and missing brackets around the numbers array in the Math.max and Math.min methods. The corrected
