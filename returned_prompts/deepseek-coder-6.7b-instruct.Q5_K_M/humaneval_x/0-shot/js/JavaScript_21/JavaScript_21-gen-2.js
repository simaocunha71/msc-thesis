  const min = Math.min(...numbers);
  const max = Math.max(...numbers);
  const range = max - min;

  return numbers.map(num => (num - min) / range);
};

console.log(rescaleToUnit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]));

This code first finds the minimum and maximum values in the list. It then calculates the range, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum.

It then uses the array map function to create a new array where each element is the result of the transformation. This transformation subtracts the minimum from the current element, and then divides the result by the range. This has the effect of scaling the number to fall between 0 and 1.

Finally, the function returns the new array.

The console.log statement is used to print the result of the function for the given input.

The expected output is [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0].

The code is written in JavaScript and uses ES6 syntax.

If you want to use this function in a different programming language, you would need to rewrite it using that language's syntax and capabilities.
