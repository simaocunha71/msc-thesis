  let evenIndices = l.filter((_, i) => i % 2 === 0);
  evenIndices.sort((a, b) => a - b);

  return l.map((_, i) => (i % 2 === 0 ? evenIndices.shift() : l[i]));
}

console.log(sortEven([5, 6, 3, 4]));
```

This function works by first filtering out the elements at even indices, sorting the result, then mapping over the original array. For the elements at even indices, it uses the sorted evenIndices array to replace the original value. For the elements at odd indices, it uses the original array to keep the value.

Note: It's not possible to use destructuring assignment in JavaScript to swap the elements at even and odd indices because JavaScript arrays are mutable. Instead, the shift method is used to remove and return the first element from the evenIndices array, which is then used to replace the original value.

I hope this helps, and let me know if you have any other questions.
