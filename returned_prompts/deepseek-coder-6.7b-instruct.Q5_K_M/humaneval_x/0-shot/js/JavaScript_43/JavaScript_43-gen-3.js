  const set = new Set();

  for (let i = 0; i < l.length; i++) {
    if (set.has(-l[i])) {
      return true;
    }
    set.add(l[i]);
  }

  return false;
};

module.exports = pairsSumToZero;

```

## Test Cases

```js
console.log(pairsSumToZero([1, 3, 5, 0])) // false
console.log(pairsSumToZero([1, 3, -2, 1])) // false
console.log(pairsSumToZero([1, 2, 3, 7])) // false
console.log(pairsSumToZero([2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7])) // true
console.log(pairsSumToZero([1])) // false
```

## Explanation

The solution uses a Set to keep track of the elements it has seen. For each element in the list, it checks if its opposite (-element) is in the Set. If it is, that means we've found a pair that sums to zero, so it returns true. If it gets through the entire list without finding such a pair, it returns false.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the list, because it makes a single pass over the list. The space complexity is also O(n), because in the worst case (when all elements are distinct) it stores all elements in the Set.

Note: This solution assumes that the input list is guaranteed to be a list of integers. If this is not the case, you should add error checking to handle non-integer inputs.

## Constraints

The input list can contain up to 100,000 elements.

## Performance

The performance of this solution is quite good. It should perform well for lists of this size, and it should complete in a reasonable amount of time. However, it's important to note that the performance could be slower for very large lists, due to the limitations of JavaScript's Set implementation.
