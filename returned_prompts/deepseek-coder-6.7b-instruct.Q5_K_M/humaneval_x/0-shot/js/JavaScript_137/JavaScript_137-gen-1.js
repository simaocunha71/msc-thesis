This function works by first ensuring that both inputs are of the same type. If an input is a string, it is converted to a number by replacing any commas with periods and then parsing the string to a float.

It then checks if the inputs are equal and returns null if they are. Finally, it returns the larger of the two inputs.

The JavaScript function uses the ternary operator to determine the larger of the two inputs.

The time complexity of this function is O(1), meaning it runs in constant time, regardless of the size of the inputs. The space complexity is also O(1), meaning it uses constant space.
