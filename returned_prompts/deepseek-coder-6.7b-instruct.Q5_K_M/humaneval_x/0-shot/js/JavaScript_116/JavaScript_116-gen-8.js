  // First, we need to convert each integer in the array to its binary representation.
  // Then, count the number of ones in the binary representation.
  // After that, sort the array based on the count of ones and then decimal value of the integer.
  
  return arr.sort((a, b) => {
    let aBinary = a.toString(2);
    let bBinary = b.toString(2);
    let aOnes = aBinary.split('1').length - 1;
    let bOnes = bBinary.split('1').length - 1;
    return aOnes - bOnes || a - b;
  });
}


// Example:
console.log(sortArray([1, 5, 2, 3, 4])); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
console.log(sortArray([-2, -3, -4, -5, -6])); // [-6, -5, -4, -3, -2]
console.log(sortArray([1, 0, 2, 3, 4])); // [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

The code works by first converting each number to its binary representation using the `toString(2)` method. Then it counts the number of ones in the binary representation by splitting the string by '1' and subtracting 1 from the length. It then sorts the array by the count of ones and the decimal value of the number, using the `sort` function.

The `sort` function is called with a comparator function that takes two elements `a` and `b`. It returns a negative, zero, or positive value depending on whether `a` is less than, equal to, or greater than `b`. In this case, it uses the count of ones from the binary representations to determine the order, and if the counts are equal, it uses the decimal value of the numbers.

The result is a sorted array of numbers based on the number of ones in their binary representation and the decimal value of the numbers.
