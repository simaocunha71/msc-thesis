// Explanation:
// The sort function is used here with a custom comparator that first checks how many ones are in the binary representation of the numbers.
// If the number of ones are the same, it sorts by the decimal value of the number.

// The toString method is used to convert the number to its binary representation as a string.
// The split method is used to count the number of ones by splitting the string on '1' and subtracting 1 to account for the extra '1' at the start of the string.
// The sort function sorts the array in ascending order based on the custom comparator.

// The function returns the sorted array.

// The function is tested with the given test cases and the expected results are printed.

/*
  Note:
  This solution assumes that the array will only contain non-negative integers.
  If the array can contain negative numbers, the function should be modified to handle this case.
  */

/*
  Note:
  This solution uses a bitwise operator to count the number of ones in the binary representation of a number.
  This operator is not used in this function, but it's worth mentioning.

  This solution uses the JavaScript built-in sort function with a custom comparator.
