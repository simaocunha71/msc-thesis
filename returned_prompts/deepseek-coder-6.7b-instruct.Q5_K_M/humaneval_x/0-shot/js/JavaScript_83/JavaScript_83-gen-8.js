  if (n === 1) return 2;
  return Math.pow(10, n-1) + 10;
};

console.log(startsOneEnds(2)); // 32
console.log(startsOneEnds(3)); // 110

Explanation:
  When n=1, there are 2 such numbers, 1 and 10. 
  For n>1, there are 10^(n-1) numbers that start with 1 and end with any other digit. 
  Plus, there are 10 additional numbers that start with any digit but 0 and end with 1.
