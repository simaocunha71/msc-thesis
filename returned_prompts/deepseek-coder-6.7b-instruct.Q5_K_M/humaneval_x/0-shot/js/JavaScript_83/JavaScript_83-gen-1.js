  return n === 1 ? 1 : 8 * 2 * (n - 2) + 4;
};
```

The function startsOneEnds takes an integer `n` as input and returns the count of the numbers of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1.

Here is how it works:

- If `n` is 1, it returns 1 because there is only one one-digit number that starts or ends with 1.
- If `n` is greater than 1, it calculates the count as `8 * 2 * (n - 2) + 4`.
  - The `8 * 2` part calculates the count of n-digit numbers that start or end with 1 and have neither 1 as the first or last digit.
  - The `(n - 2)` part calculates the count of n-digit numbers that have a 1 as the first or last digit.
  - The `+4` part adds the count of n-digit numbers that start or end with 1.

This function is a mathematical solution for the problem and is efficient for large inputs.

Here is the JavaScript code for the function:

```javascript
const startsOneEnds = (n) => {
  return n === 1 ? 1 : 8 * 2 * (n - 2) + 4;
};
```

You can use this function to find the count of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1. For example:

```javascript
console.log(startsOneEnds(2));  // Output: 8
console.log(startsOneEnds(3));  // Output: 80
console.log(startsOneEnds(4));  // Output: 800
```

This function works for any positive integer `n`, including zero. For `n` less than or equal to zero, the function will return `NaN` (Not a Number).

Note: This function assumes that the count of n-digit numbers starts from 0. If the count starts from 1, you can simply subtract 1 from the result.

Also note: This function uses a simple mathematical formula to calculate the count of n-digit
