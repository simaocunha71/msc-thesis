  return 2 * (10 ** (n - 1));
};

console.log(startsOneEnds(2));


A: Here is a Python solution:

```python
def starts_one_ends(n):
    return 2 * (10 ** (n - 1))

print(starts_one_ends(2))
```

This function works by returning the number of n-digit numbers that start or end with 1. This is achieved by multiplying 2 by 10 to the power of n-1. This is because there are 2 * 10 to the power of n-1 n-digit numbers that start or end with 1.

This Python script defines the function `starts_one_ends(n)`, which takes an integer `n` and returns the count of the numbers of `n`-digit positive integers that start or end with 1. The result of the function is printed to the console.

In JavaScript, the solution would look like this:

```javascript
const startsOneEnds = (n) => 2 * (10 ** (n - 1));

console.log(startsOneEnds(2));
```

This JavaScript function does the same thing as the Python function. It takes an integer `n` and returns the count of the numbers of `n`-digit positive integers that start or end with 1. The result of the function is printed to the console.

Both these solutions use the same logic: there are 2 * 10 to the power of n-1 n-digit numbers that start or end with 1.
