//Explanation:
In this problem, we're asked to count the number of odd numbers in each string of a given list. We iterate over each string and count the number of odd numbers, then substitute the count number in a certain string format and return it in a new array.

//Pseudocode:
1. Initialize an empty array to store the result.
2. Iterate over each string in the given list.
3. For each string, count the number of odd numbers.
4. Replace the count number in a certain string format and add it to the result array.
5. Return the result array.

//Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n*m) where n is the number of strings in the given list and m is the length of the longest string. This is because we have to iterate over each string and then over each character in the string.

//Space Complexity:
The space complexity is also O(n) as we are storing the result in a new array.

//Optimization:
The given solution is already optimized as it only requires a single pass over each string to count the number of odd numbers. It has a linear time complexity.
