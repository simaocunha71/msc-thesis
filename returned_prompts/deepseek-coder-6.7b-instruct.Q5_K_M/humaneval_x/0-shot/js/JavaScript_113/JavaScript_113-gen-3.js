// Time Complexity: O(n*m) where n is the number of strings in the list and m is the length of each string
// Space Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of strings in the list

// The time complexity is O(n*m) because for each string we iterate through its length, and for each string we do this n times.
// The space complexity is O(n) because we store the result in a new array, and the size of this array is determined by the number of strings.

// This solution assumes that the input list will not be empty and will only contain strings of digits.
// If there's any possibility of invalid input, additional error checking should be added.

// The solution uses JavaScript's built-in map function to create a new array where each element is a string based on the corresponding element of the input array.
// The map function calls a function for each element in the input array and includes the current element, its index, and the array itself as parameters.
// The function counts the number of odd digits in the current string and returns a string with this count substituted for all occurrences of "x".

// Finally, the function returns the new array.
