**Explanation:**

The function oddCount takes in a list of strings. For each string, it counts the number of odd digits. The count is then used to create a string that is added to the result list. The result list is then returned.

**Complexity:**

The time complexity of this function is O(n*m), where n is the number of strings in the list, and m is the length of the longest string. This is because we need to iterate over each character in each string to count the number of odd digits.

The space complexity is O(n), as we create a new string for each string in the list.

**Possible Improvements:**

One way to improve this function could be to not create a new string for each string in the input list. Instead, we could modify the original strings in place. This would reduce the space complexity to O(1), since we are not creating any new data structures that grow with the size of the input. However
