A: In order to solve this problem, we first need to define two functions:

*

*The first function, primeCheck(num), checks if a number is a prime number.

*The second function, primeFactors(num), finds all prime factors of a number.

Then, we calculate the prime factors of the given number (a) and check if the number of prime factors is even. If it is, the function returns true, indicating that the given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers. Otherwise, it returns false.

This solution assumes that the input number is less than 100, as you mentioned in the problem statement.

Note that the function primeCheck has a time complexity of O(n) and the function primeFactors has a time complexity of O(n^2).

The overall time complexity of the function is O(n^2), which is acceptable given that n is less than 100.

The space complexity of the function is O(k), where k is the number of distinct prime factors of the input number. This is because we are storing the prime factors of the input number in an array.

Therefore, this solution is efficient for inputs less than 100.

The function will return false for inputs that are not the multiplication of 3 prime numbers.

For example:

console.log(isMultiplyPrime(30)); // true
console.log(isMultiplyPrime(42)); // false
console.log(isMultip
