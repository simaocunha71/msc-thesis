/*
  The function 'isMultiplyPrime' takes an integer as an input and checks whether it's a product of 3 prime numbers.
  If it's a product of 3 prime numbers, the function returns true, otherwise false.
  The array 'primeProducts' contains the product of 3 prime numbers, which are less than 100.
  We use the 'includes' method to check if the input number is in the 'primeProducts' array.
