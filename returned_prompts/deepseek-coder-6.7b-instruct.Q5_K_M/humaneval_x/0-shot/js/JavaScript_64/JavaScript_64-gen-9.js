```

This program defines a function `vowelsCount` that takes a string as argument and loops through it character by character. If the character is a vowel or a 'y' at the end of the string, it increments a counter. Finally, it returns the counter.

Test the function with several examples to validate its correctness.

Note: The function is case-sensitive. If you want to make it case-insensitive, you can convert the input string to lower case before processing it.

This program should run without errors, and print the expected results for the provided examples.
