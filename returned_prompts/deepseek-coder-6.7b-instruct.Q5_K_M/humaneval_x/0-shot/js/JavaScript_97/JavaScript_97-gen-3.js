//16
//72

//20

//The function works by finding the unit digits of the inputs by taking the remainder 
//when divided by 10 (which gives the rightmost digit). Then it multiplies these 
//digits and returns the result.

//Math.abs() is used to ensure the function works correctly with negative numbers.
//In the problem statement it was mentioned that the input is always valid, so we don't 
//need to handle any invalid inputs.

//This solution has a time complexity of O(1) as it performs a constant number of operations.
//It also has a space complexity of O(1) as it uses a constant amount of space.
