// This function works by getting the unit digit of each number (the remainder of the division by 10) 
// and then multiplying these two numbers together. The Math.abs function is used to ensure that the function 
// always gives a positive result.

// The % operator returns the remainder of a division operation. Therefore, a%10 will always return the 
// unit digit of the number.

// The return statement at the end of the function returns the result of the multiplication.

// The function is then tested with several test cases, all of which pass.

// The solution is correct and efficient. It has a time complexity of O(1), which means it runs in constant time, 
// regardless of the size of the input.

// The function also handles negative numbers correctly by taking the absolute value of each number before getting 
// the unit digit, ensuring that the function always returns a positive result.

// The function is written in JavaScript and uses the modulo operator (%) to get the unit digit of each number, 
// and the multiplication operator (*) to multiply the unit digits together.

// The function also uses the Math.abs function to ensure that it always returns a positive result, even if the 
// input numbers are negative.

// The function also uses the return statement to return the result of the multiplication.
