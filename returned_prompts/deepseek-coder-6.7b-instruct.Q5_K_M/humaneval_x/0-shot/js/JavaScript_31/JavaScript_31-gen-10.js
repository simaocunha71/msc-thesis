This solution first checks if the number is less than or equal to 1, which it is, and if it is, it returns `false`. It then checks if the number is less than or equal to 3, which it is, and if it is, it returns `true`. After that, it checks if the number is divisible by 2 or 3, in which case it returns `false`.

The while loop then checks if the number is divisible by any number between 5 and the square root of the number. If it is, it returns `false`. The increment `i += 6` is used to skip multiples of 2 and 3, since we have already checked for divisibility by 2 and 3.

Finally, if the number has not been identified as divisible by any of the tested numbers, it is a prime number, so the function returns `true`.

The time complexity of this solution is `O(sqrt(n))`, because in the worst case, the function checks up to the square root of `n` for factors.

The space complexity is `O(1)`, because no additional space is used that scales with the size of the input.

This solution is based on the fact that all primes are of the form 6k Â± 1, with the exception of 2 and 3. This allows us to skip checking for factors
