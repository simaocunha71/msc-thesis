Explanation:

The function `canArrange` takes an array `arr` as an argument and loops over the array in reverse order (starting from the end). It checks each element if it is less than the previous one. If it is, it sets `largestIndex` to the current index and breaks the loop. The function then returns `largestIndex`. If no such element is found, it returns `-1`.

This function can be used to solve a number of problems related to arrays, such as finding the largest index of an element which is not greater than the previous one, or finding the largest index of an element which is less than the next one.
