// The function works by looping through the array, comparing each element
// with the one preceding it. If the current element is less than the
// preceding one, then it is not in order and the index is recorded.
// The loop continues until the end of the array, and then the function
// returns the largest index found.

// If no such element is found, the function returns -1.

// The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the array.
// This is because it needs to loop through the array once. The space complexity is O(1),
// as no additional space is used that scales with the input size.
