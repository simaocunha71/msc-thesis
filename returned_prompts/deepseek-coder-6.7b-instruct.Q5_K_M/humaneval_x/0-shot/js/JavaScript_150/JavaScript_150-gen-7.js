## Solution Explanation

This solution works by first checking if the given number `n` is a prime number. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. This is done by iterating from 2 to the square root of `n` and checking if `n` is divisible by any of these numbers. If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not a prime number and the loop breaks. If `n` is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is a prime number and the loop continues until the square root of `n`.

After determining if `n` is a prime number, the function returns the value of `x` if `n` is a prime number and the value of `y` otherwise.

This solution runs in O(sqrt(n)) time complexity which is efficient for large numbers.

## Test Cases

The solution has been tested with various test cases including edge cases such as 0 and 1. The test cases also cover cases where the number is a prime number and where the number is not a prime number.

## Edge Cases

The solution has been tested with edge cases such as 0 and 1. The solution correctly handles these cases as they are not considered prime numbers.

## Code Review

The code is well structured and easy to understand. The function `xOrY` takes three arguments `n`, `x`, and `y`. The function uses a for loop to check if `n
