console.log(xOrY(7, 34, 12)) // 34
console.log(xOrY(15, 8, 5)) // 5
console.log(xOrY(4, 100, 200)) // 200
console.log(xOrY(3, 10, 20)) // 10
```

This function first checks if the number is 1, if so, it sets the `isPrime` variable to `false`.
If the number is greater than 1, it loops through each number from 2 to n-1 and checks if n is divisible by the current number. If it is, it sets `isPrime` to `false` and breaks the loop.
Finally, it returns `x` if `isPrime` is true, and `y` if `isPrime` is false.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), because in the worst case it checks each number from 2 to n-1 to see if n is divisible by it.

The space complexity is O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and `isPrime`.

The function is correct and efficient, but it can be optimized by checking only the numbers up to the square root of n because a larger factor of n must be a multiple of a smaller factor that has already been checked.

Here is the optimized version of the function:

```javascript
const xOrY = (n, x, y) => {
  if (n <= 1) {
    return y;
  }
  
  for(let i = 2;
