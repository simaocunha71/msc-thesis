  let arr = [];

  for(let i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
    arr.push(i);
  }

  return arr.join(' ');
}

console.log(stringSequence(0));
console.log(stringSequence(5));


// 1. Create an empty array
// 2. Loop through the numbers from 0 to n (inclusive)
// 3. On each iteration, add the current number to the array
// 4. After the loop, join the array elements with spaces and return it

// This solution has time complexity O(n) because it has to loop through n elements.
// It has space complexity O(n) because it has to store n elements in the array.
// The join operation also has time complexity O(n).

## [](#comments)Comments:

The code is simple and straightforward. It uses a for loop to generate the sequence of numbers from 0 to n. The numbers are stored in an array, and then joined into a string with spaces in between the numbers. This is the most straightforward way to generate the sequence.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) because it has to iterate through n numbers. The space complexity is also O(n) because it has to store n numbers in an array. The join operation has a time complexity of O(n), but it's still a part of the main function.

This solution is efficient for small values of n, but for larger values of n, it might be slower than other solutions because it has to store all the numbers in an array before it can join them into a string.

Overall, this is a good solution for this problem.
