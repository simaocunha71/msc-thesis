  let result = '';
  for (let i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
    result += i + ' ';

console.log(stringSequence(5));
```

The function `stringSequence` takes an argument `n` and returns a string of space-separated numbers starting from 0 up to `n`. It uses a `for` loop to iterate from 0 to `n`, concatenating each number and a space onto a string. Finally, it trims off the trailing space with `trim()` before returning the result.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), because it requires one iteration of the loop for each number from 0 to `n`. Its space complexity is also O(n), because the size of the result string is proportional to `n`.

This function can be further optimized by using JavaScript's `Array.from()` method to create an array of numbers from 0 to `n`, then joining them together with `join(' ')`. This would reduce the number of operations and make the function more concise.

```js
const stringSequence = (n) => {
  return Array.from({length: n + 1}, (_, i) => i).join(' ');
}

console.log(stringSequence(0));
console.log(stringSequence(5));
```

This version of the function has the same time and space complexity as the original version, but it's a bit more concise and idiomatic JavaScript.

```js
const stringSequence = n => Array.from({length: n + 1}, (_, i) => i).join(' ');

console.log(stringSequence(0));
console.log(stringSequence(5));
```

This version is even more concise and idiomatic. It uses an arrow function syntax, implicitly returns the result of the `join` method, and uses a destructuring assignment for the second argument of the `Array.from` callback function to directly get the index `i`.

```js
const stringSequence = n => Array.from({length: n + 1}, (_, i) => i).join(' ');
