  let increasing = true;
  let decreasing = true;

B:
  for (let i = 0; i < l.length - 1; i++) {
    if (l[i] > l[i + 1]) {
      increasing = false;
    }
    if (l[i] < l[i + 1]) {
      decreasing = false;
    }
  }

C:
  return increasing || decreasing;
}
```

This program checks if the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing by comparing each element to the next one. If it finds an element that is greater than the next one, it sets `increasing` to `false`. If it finds an element that is less than the next one, it sets `decreasing` to `false`. Finally, it returns the result of the logical OR operation of `increasing` and `decreasing`. If either is `true`, the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing, so it returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

I hope this helps clarify it for you. Please let me know if you have any more questions.

### Answer 2

Here is the solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
function monotonic(arr) {
    return (
        arr.every((val, i) => i === 0 || arr[i - 1] <= val) ||
        arr.every((val, i) => i === 0 || arr[i - 1] >= val)
    );
}
```

This function uses the `every` method to test whether all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function. The provided function checks whether the current element is greater than or equal to the previous one (for an increasing sequence) or whether the current element is less than or equal to the previous one (for a decreasing sequence). If at least one of these conditions is met, the function returns `true`, indicating that the array is monotonically increasing or decreasing. If neither condition is met, the function returns `false`.

Here is how you can use it:

```javascript
console.log(monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20]));  // Output: true
console.log(monotonic([1,
