# Solution

The solution works by iteratively dividing the given integer `n` by integers starting from `2` until `n` is fully divided. If an integer `i` fully divides `n`, it is added to the factors list and `n` is divided by `i`. This process is repeated until `n` can no longer be divided.

The factors are returned in the order of their smallest to largest values.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the input number. This is because in the worst case scenario, the algorithm iterates up to `n` times. The space complexity is also O(n), as in the worst case scenario, all factors will be unique and stored in the factors list.

In JavaScript, the `push()` method adds an element to the end of an array and the `while` loop continues to execute as long as the condition is `true`. The `%` operator is the modulus operator which returns the remainder of a division.

This solution assumes that the input number is positive and greater than or equal to `2`. If the input number is less than `2`, an empty array is returned since there are no prime factors.

If you want to handle negative numbers and zero, you should add additional error checking at the beginning of the function to return an error message in these cases.

The function `factorize` is defined as a constant (`const`) to prevent it from being reassigned. If you wanted to use this function more than once, you could define it as a variable instead.

The `console.log()` statements at the end are used to test the function with various inputs and print the result to the console.

The `=>` operator is used to define a function
