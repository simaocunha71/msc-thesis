This code works by starting with the smallest prime number (2) and checking if it divides the input number (n). If it does, that number is added to the factors array and n is divided by that number. The loop then starts again with the next number. This process continues until n is no longer divisible by any number. The factors array is then returned.

This is an example of a prime factorization algorithm. It is a common way to factorize numbers, and it works because all numbers can be factored into their prime factors. The prime factorization of a number is the representation of that number as a product of its prime factors, where each prime factor is used as many times as it appears in the prime factorization of the number.

In JavaScript, the `%` operator is used to get the remainder of a division operation. If a number n is divisible by another number i, the remainder of the division (n % i) will be 0. The loop continues until n is no longer divisible by i, at which point it starts with the next number.

The `push()` method adds an item to the end of an array, and the `/=` operator is a shorthand for n = n / i. It divides n by i and assigns the result back to n.

Finally, the function `factorize()` is exported for use in other modules, and the console.log() calls at the end are used to test the function.

This code is written in JavaScript, a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and ease of use.

### Factorize(25)

Here, n=25.

i=2, n % i = 1, so 2 is not a factor of 25, continue to next i=3, n=25, n % i = 1, so 3 is not a factor of 25,
