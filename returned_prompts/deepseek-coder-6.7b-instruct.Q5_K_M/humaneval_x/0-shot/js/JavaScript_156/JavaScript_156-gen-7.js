## Code Explanation

The function `intToMiniRoman` takes a positive integer `number` as an argument.

It first defines an object `roman` that maps integers to their roman numeral equivalents.

Then, it initializes an empty string `result` to hold the roman numeral equivalent of `number`.

The function then loops over each key-value pair in `roman`. For each pair, if `number` is greater than or equal to the key, it appends the value to `result` and subtracts the key from `number`. This process is repeated until `number` is less than the key.

Finally, the function returns `result`.

The function is then tested with some examples.

## Possible Improvements

1. The current implementation is straightforward and efficient. However, it could be improved by adding error checking to ensure that `number` is a positive integer and within the specified range.
2. The current implementation uses a simple object for mapping integers to roman numerals. A more complex implementation could use a more sophisticated data structure, such as a binary search tree, to improve lookup efficiency.
3. The current implementation uses a simple loop to iterate over the keys of the `
