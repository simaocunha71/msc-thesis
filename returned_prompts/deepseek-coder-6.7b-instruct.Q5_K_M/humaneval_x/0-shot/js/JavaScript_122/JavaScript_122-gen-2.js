console.log(addElements([111,21,3,4000,5,6,7,8,9], 4));

// The solution is to convert the integer to string, and then use the length property to check if the number has at most two digits.
// If it does, add the number to the sum. Finally, return the sum.
// The time complexity is O(n) as we only loop through the array once, and the space complexity is O(1) as we only use a single variable to store the sum.

##### Explanation

This problem requires a basic understanding of array manipulation and string manipulation in JavaScript. The given array is an array of integers and we are asked to find the sum of the first k elements of the array where each element has at most two digits.

We can solve this problem by using a simple for loop to iterate through the first k elements of the array. Inside the loop, we convert each integer to a string using the `toString()` method, then we can use the `length` property of a string to find out the number of digits in the integer. If the number of digits is less than or equal to 2, we add the integer to a running total (`sum`). Finally, we return the `sum`.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) because we iterate through the array once to find the sum, and the space complexity is O(1) because we only use a single variable to store the sum.

##### Solution

Here is the JavaScript solution:

```javascript
const addElements = (arr, k) => {
  let sum = 0;
  for(let i = 0; i < k; i++){
    if(arr[i].toString().length <= 2){
      sum += arr[i];
    }
  }
  return sum;
}

console.log(addElements([111,21,3,4000,5,6,
