  let sum = 0;
  for(let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
      if(arr[i].toString().length <= 2) {
          sum += arr[i];
      }
  }
  return sum;
};

console.log(addElements([111,21,3,4000,5,6,7,8,9], 4));
```

**Answer:**

The question is asking to add up the elements that have at most 2 digits from the first k elements in the array. To solve this, we can iterate over the first k elements in the array. For each element, we convert it to a string and check the length of the string. If the length of the string is less than or equal to 2, we add the element to the sum. Finally, we return the sum.

Here is the JavaScript code for the problem:

```javascript
const addElements = (arr, k) => {
  let sum = 0;
  for(let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
      if(arr[i].toString().length <= 2) {
          sum += arr[i];
      }
  }
  return sum;
};

console.log(addElements([111,21,3,4000,5,6,7,8,9], 4)); // Output: 24
```

This will output 24 as the sum of 21 and 3 from the first 4 elements of the array.

Please, try to solve this problem by yourself before checking the solution.
