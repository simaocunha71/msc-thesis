// This solution works by splitting the input string into an array of sentences.
// It then loops through each sentence and checks if it starts with the word "I".
// If it does, it increments the count. Finally, it returns the count.
// The split function uses a regular expression to split the string at each sentence delimiter.
// The startsWith function is used to check if the sentence starts with the word "I".
// The trim function is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from each sentence.
// The count is initialized to 0 and incremented each time a sentence starting with "I" is found.
// The function returns the count.

// The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
// This is because the function loops through each character of the string once.
// The space complexity is also O(n), due to the creation of an array of sentences.
// In the worst case scenario, each sentence will be a separate element in the array.
// Therefore, the space complexity is proportional to the number of sentences.

// These assumptions are based on the problem statement and the examples provided.
// In a real-world scenario, additional testing may be required to ensure the function handles all possible
