In the given code, we have two functions that are used to encode and decode the string by shifting every character by 5 in the alphabet. The `caesarCipher` function takes a string as an argument and returns the encoded string, and the `caesarCipherDecode` function takes an encoded string as an argument and returns the decoded string.

Here are some examples of how you can use the functions:

```javascript
console.log(caesarCipher("hello")); // expected output: "mjqqt"
console.log(caesarCipherDecode("mjqqt")); // expected output: "hello"
```

Note: This code assumes that the input string only contains lowercase letters and no other characters. If the input string contains uppercase letters, digits, or special characters, you will need to modify the code to handle these cases.

Also, the code uses the modulus operator (`%`) to wrap around the alphabet when the shift takes a character past the end of the alphabet. This ensures that the encoding and decoding are symmetric and invertible.

Finally, the `charCodeAt` method is used to convert the characters to and from their ASCII numerical representations. This is necessary because JavaScript doesn't have a built-in method for shifting characters in the alphabet.
