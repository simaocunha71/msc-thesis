  return BigInt(2) ** BigInt(n) % BigInt(p);
};

// Test cases
console.log(modp(3, 5)); // 3
console.log(modp(1101, 101)); // 2
console.log(modp(0, 101)); // 1
console.log(modp(3, 11)); // 8
console.log(modp(100, 101)); // 1

This solution uses BigInt to handle very large numbers.

In the function, we are taking two numbers n and p as arguments. We are raising 2 to the power of n and then finding the modulo with p. The result is then returned by the function.

The BigInt function is used to convert the numbers into BigIntegers which are used to handle very large numbers.

The modulo operator is used to find the remainder of the division of the two numbers.

In JavaScript, the modulo operation with negative numbers gives a result that is not intuitive. For example, -10 % 3 = -1, not 2. This is why we use BigInt to avoid such issues.

The function returns the result of the modulo operation.

This function can be used to find the remainder of a power of 2 when divided by a prime number.

The function is used in cryptography to ensure that the result of a mathematical operation does not become too large. This is because large numbers can be difficult to handle and can slow down a program.

The function can be used in various fields such as computer science, mathematics, and more.

The function is also useful in competitive programming, where large numbers and modulo operations are common.

In conclusion, this function is a very useful tool in the toolbox of a programmer. It can be used in various ways to solve various problems, from basic to advanced mathematics.

Also, it's important to note that the function uses BigInt to handle very large numbers. If you try to use this function with very large numbers, it might not work as expected because JavaScript can't handle very large numbers.

The function is also used in computer science and mathematics to handle very large numbers. It's a fundamental tool in the toolbox of a program
