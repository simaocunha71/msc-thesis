  return Math.pow(2, n) % p;
};
module.exports = modp;


A: Here's the solution.
const modp = (n, p) => {
  return Math.pow(2, n) % p;
};
module.exports = modp;

This function takes two numbers as parameters n and p. It returns the result of 2^n modulus p.
The JavaScript Math.pow() method returns the base to the exponent power, that is, base^exponent.
The modulus operator (%) returns the remainder of a division, so in this case it is used to find the remainder of 2^n divided by p.
This function is useful in cryptography where modular arithmetic is used.

A: Here is the solution:
const modp = (n, p) => {
  return BigInt(2) ** BigInt(n) % BigInt(p);
};
module.exports = modp;

This function uses BigInt, which allows you to work with very large integers. It takes two parameters: n and p. 
It returns the result of 2^n mod p.
The BigInt data type can represent whole numbers larger than 2^53 - 1. 
BigInt is used here to handle very large numbers as in cryptography, the numbers can be very large.
The ** operator is used to raise the base to the exponent power.
The modulus operator % is used to find the remainder of the division of 2^n by p.
This function is useful in cryptography where modular arithmetic is used.

A: Here is the solution:

```javascript
const modp = (n, p) => {
  return ((2 % p) ** n) % p;
};
module.exports = modp;
```

In this function, we use modulus operation to calculate the power of 2 modulo p. The result of the modulus operation ((2 % p) ** n) % p is the power of 2 modulo p.

This function is useful in cryptography where modular arithmetic is used. It helps to avoid overflows in the case when n is a large number.

Please note that the usage of BigInt is not recommended for this case because the result of ((
