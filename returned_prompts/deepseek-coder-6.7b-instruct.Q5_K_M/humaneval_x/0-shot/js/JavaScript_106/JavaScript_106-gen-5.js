A: You can use a single loop and a conditional statement to determine whether to calculate factorial or sum. Here is the optimized code:


const f = n => {
    const arr = [];
    let fact = 1, sum = 0;
    for(let i = 1; i <= n; i++){
        if(i % 2 === 0){
            fact *= i;
            arr.push(fact);
        }else{
            sum += i;
            arr.push(sum);
        }
    }
    return arr;
}

console.log(f(5));


This code will work faster than the previous one because it avoids redundant computations. The factorial of an even number is always the product of all the numbers from 1 to that number, and the sum of all numbers up to an odd number is the sum of all the numbers from 1 to that number. Therefore, we can calculate these values once and use them in all the even and odd indexes, respectively.
The time complexity of this code is O(n), and the space complexity is also O(n), where n is the input number.

A: Here is the optimized version of the code:


const f = n => {
    let arr = new Array(n);
    let fact = 1, sum = 0;
    for(let i = 1; i <= n; i++){
        if(i % 2 === 0){
            fact
