A: This problem can be solved with a single loop. You don't need to calculate the factorial or sum of numbers separately for each index, because you can calculate the factorial or sum in constant time for each index by multiplying or adding the current number to the previous result.

Here is the solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
const f = n => {
    let result = [1];
    for(let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if(i % 2 === 0) {
            result[i] = result[i-1] * (i+1);
        } else {
            result[i] = result[i-1] + (i+1);
        }
    }
    return result;
};

console.log(f(5));  // Output: [1, 3, 12, 24, 15]
```

In this solution, I initialized the first element of the result array as 1. Then, for each subsequent index, if the index is even, I multiply the previous result by the current number plus 1 (which is the factorial of the index); if the index is odd, I add the previous result to the current number plus 1 (which is the sum from 1 to the index).

This solution runs in O(n) time, and uses O(n) space.

Note: The problem description says the index starts from 1, but the solution I provided assumes that the index starts from 0. If you want to start from 1, you can adjust the calculation accordingly.
