//Test cases
console.log(f(5)); //== [1, 2, 6, 24, 15]
console.log(f(4)); //== [1, 2, 6, 10]
console.log(f(3)); //== [1, 2, 6]

//Explanation:
//f(5): [1, 2*(1), 6*(1*2), 24*(1*2*3), 15*(1*2*3*4)]
//f(4): [1, 2*(1), 6*(1*2), 10*(1*2*3)]
//f(3): [1, 2*(1), 6*(1*2)]

//As per the question, i starts from 1.
//The value of the element at index i is the factorial of i if i is even
//or the sum of numbers from 1 to i otherwise.
//For the even indices, we calculate the factorial and for the odd indices, we calculate the sum.
//We do this for all the indices up to n and return the resulting list.

//Note: The problem statement mentions 'factorial of i' which is not the same as the factorial of 'i!' which is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to 'i'.
//In the given problem statement, 'factorial of i' means the product of all positive integers less than or equal to 'i'.
//I have assumed that you have understood this.

//Also, it's important to note that this code may not work correctly for very large values of n, as the factorial
