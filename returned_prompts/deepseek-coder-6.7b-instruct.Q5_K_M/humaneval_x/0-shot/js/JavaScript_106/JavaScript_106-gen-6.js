Explanation:
In the solution, we first create two helper functions: `fact` and `sum`.
`fact` calculates the factorial of a number, and `sum` calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to n.
The main function `f` is a pure function that takes an integer n as input and returns a new array of length n.
We generate this array by iterating over its elements and calculating the factorial or sum of the index based on whether it's even or odd.
We use `Array.from` to generate the array, specifying the length and a map function that calculates the required values.
The map function uses the helper functions `fact` and `sum` to calculate the factorial or sum of the index (+1 because the problem specifies indexing starts from 1, but our helper functions use 0-based indexing).

// Note: This solution assumes that n is a positive integer. If n can be 0 or negative, you should add error checking.

// Note: This solution uses recursion for calculating factorial and sum of numbers, which can lead to a stack overflow for large inputs.
// It's recommended to use an iterative solution for calculating factorial and sum, or to use memoization to avoid repeated calculations.

// Note: The problem statement specifies that the factorial of 0 is 1, not 0. Therefore, the factorial of an even number i is the product of the numbers from 1 to i+1.
// If you want the factorial of 0 to be 0, you should adjust the `fact` function to return 0 for i === 0.

// Note: This solution uses a one-based indexing for the problem statement, but uses a zero-based indexing for the solution.
