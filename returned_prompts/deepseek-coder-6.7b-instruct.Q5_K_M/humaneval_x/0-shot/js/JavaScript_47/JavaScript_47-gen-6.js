let len = l.length;
  l.sort((a, b) => a - b);

  if (len % 2 === 0) {
    return (l[len / 2 - 1] + l[len / 2]) / 2;
  } else {
    return l[Math.floor(len / 2)];
  }

console.log(median([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])); // 3
console.log(median([-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20])); // 8.0
```

The code sorts the array and then checks if the length of the array is even or odd. If it's even, it calculates the median by averaging the two middle elements; if it's odd, it takes the middle element as the median.

It's important to note that sort() method sorts the numbers in ascending order. So, we provide a comparator function ((a, b) => a - b) to ensure that the numbers are sorted in ascending order.

The Math.floor() function is used to get the integer part of a number, which is required as sort() might not always return whole numbers.

The code returns the median of the list l.
