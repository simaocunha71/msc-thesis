/*
  Answer:
  The solution is to first determine the start and end of the range, then loop through
  the range. If the current number is even (i.e., it's divisible by 2), then it is
  pushed to the result array. Finally, the result array is returned.
*/

/*
  Explanation:
  The function takes two arguments, a and b, which represent the start and end of a
  range. The function returns an array of all even numbers in that range, in ascending
  order.

  The function uses the Math.min and Math.max functions to determine the start and end
  of the range, regardless of their order.

  Then, it loops through the range from the start to the end. If the current number is
  even (i.e., it's divisible by 2), it's added to the result array.

  Finally, the function returns the result array.
*/

/*
  The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the size of the range.
  This is because the function needs to iterate through all the numbers in the range
  once.

  The space complexity is also O(n) because in the worst case scenario, all the numbers
  in the range could be even, and so the result array would need to hold n elements.

## Python

```python
def generateIntegers(a, b):
    result = []
    start = min(a, b)
    end = max(a, b)

    for i in range(start, end + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            result.append(i)
