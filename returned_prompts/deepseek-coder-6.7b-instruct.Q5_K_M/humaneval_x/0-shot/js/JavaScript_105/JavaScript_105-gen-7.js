  const numbers = {
    1: 'One',
    2: 'Two',
    3: 'Three',
    4: 'Four',
    5: 'Five',
    6: 'Six',
    7: 'Seven',
    8: 'Eight',
    9: 'Nine'
  }

  return arr.filter(a => a>=1 && a<=9).sort((a, b) => b - a).map(a => numbers[a]);
}
byLength([2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3]);

// Output: ["Eight", "Five", "Four", "Three", "Two", "Two", "One", "One"]
```

## Approach:

1. Initialize a dictionary object `numbers` to map numbers 1 to 9 to their corresponding string names.
2. Filter the array to keep only the integers between 1 and 9 inclusive.
3. Sort the array in descending order.
4. Map the array to replace each number with its corresponding string name.
5. Return the resulting array.

## Complexity:

- Time complexity: O(n log n) because of the sorting operation.
- Space complexity: O(n) because of the extra space needed to store the resulting array.

## Limitations:

- If the array includes any number outside the range 1 to 9, it will be ignored.
- If the array includes negative numbers or numbers greater than 9, they will not be converted.
- If the array includes non-integer values, they will not be converted.
- If the array includes duplicate numbers, they will be included in the resulting array.

## Note:

This solution assumes that the input is always an array of integers. If the input could be an array of other types, you would need to add some error checking to handle those cases.

## Test cases:

```
console.log(byLength([2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3])); // ["Eight", "Five", "Four", "Three", "Two", "Two", "One", "One"]
console.log(
