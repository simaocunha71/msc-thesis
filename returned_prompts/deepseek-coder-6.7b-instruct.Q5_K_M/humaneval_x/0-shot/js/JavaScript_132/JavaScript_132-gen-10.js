console.log(isNested('[[]]')); // ➞ true
console.log(isNested('[]]]]]]][[[[[]')); // ➞ false

```

The function works by continuously replacing any occurrence of nested square brackets in the input string with nothing. This process is repeated until no more nested brackets are found. If at any point the string is empty, that means at least one bracket was nested, so the function returns true. If the string is not empty after the process, that means there were no nested brackets, so the function returns false.

This approach works because the problem statement already specifies that the input string only contains square brackets and that a valid subsequence of brackets is one in which at least one bracket is nested. By continuously removing nested brackets from the string, we ensure that at the end of the process we have removed all nested brackets, leaving only non-nested brackets if any existed. If the string is empty at this point, that means we had at least one nested bracket, otherwise there were no nested brackets.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the string, because we perform a linear scan of the string to look for nested brackets. The space complexity is also O(n), because in the worst case scenario (where there are no nested brackets) we may need to store the entire string.
