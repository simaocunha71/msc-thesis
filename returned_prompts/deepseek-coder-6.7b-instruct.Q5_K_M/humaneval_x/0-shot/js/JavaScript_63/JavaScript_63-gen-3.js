  if (n < 0) {
    throw new Error("n must be a non-negative integer");
  }

  const memo = [0, 0, 1];

  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    memo[i] = memo[i-1] + memo[i-2] + memo[i-3];
  }

  return memo[n];
};

console.log(fibfib(1)); // 0
console.log(fibfib(5)); // 4
console.log(fibfib(8)); // 24
```

The function `fibfib(n)` uses memoization to store the computed fibfib numbers, so it doesn't have to re-calculate them. This significantly reduces the time complexity, making it more efficient for large `n`.

This implementation has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n).

This solution is based on the idea of dynamic programming.

Please note that this problem is a variation of the classical Fibonacci sequence, and the function `fibfib(n)` computes the n-th number in the sequence according to the given rules.

In the case of fibfib(1), fibfib(0) and fibfib(0) are returned as 0, and fibfib(2) is returned as 1. For fibfib(n > 2), it returns the sum of the (n-1)th, (n-2)th and (n-3)th fibfib numbers.

The function throws an error if `n` is negative.
