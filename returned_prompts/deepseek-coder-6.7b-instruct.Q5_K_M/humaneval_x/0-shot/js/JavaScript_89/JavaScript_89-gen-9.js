let result = '';

  for(let i = 0; i < s.length; i++){
    let ascii = s[i].charCodeAt();
    if((ascii >= 65 && ascii <= 87) || (ascii >= 97 && ascii <= 119)){
      result += String.fromCharCode(ascii + 2 * 2);
    }else{
      result += s[i];
    }
  }

  return result;
}

console.log(encrypt('hi')); // 'lm'
console.log(encrypt('asdfghjkl')); // 'ewhjklnop'
console.log(encrypt('gf')); // 'kj'
console.log(encrypt('et')); // 'ix'

This solution is taking in consideration that the alphabet has 26 letters, and each character from 'A' to 'Z' and 'a' to 'z' has a corresponding ASCII value from 65 to 90 and 97 to 122 respectively. 

The function encrypt will loop through each character of the input string and convert it to its ASCII value. If the ASCII value lies within the range of 'A' to 'W' or 'a' to 'w' (65-87 or 97-119), it is shifted down by two places and multiplied by two. The shifted value is then converted back to a character using the String.fromCharCode method. If the ASCII value does not lie in the range of 'A' to 'W' or 'a' to 'w', the character is left as it is. 

The result is the encrypted string which is returned by the function.

Keep in mind that this solution is case sensitive.

Also, it is important to note that the result of the encryption is dependent on the ASCII values of the characters in the input string, so it may not work as expected if the characters are outside the range 'A' to 'Z' or 'a' to 'z'.
