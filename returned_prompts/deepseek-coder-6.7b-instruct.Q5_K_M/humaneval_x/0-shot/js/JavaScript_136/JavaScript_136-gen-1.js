// Time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.
// Space complexity is also O(n), as we are storing the result in a list.

// In the worst case scenario (when there are no negative or positive numbers), the function will iterate through the entire list once.
// In the best case scenario (when there are negative or positive numbers), the function will iterate through the list until it finds the required numbers.

// Therefore, the time complexity of this function is linear, and the space complexity is also linear.

// This solution assumes that the input is a list of integers. If the input is not a list, or if the list contains non-integer elements, the function may not work as expected.

// The function also assumes that the input list is not sorted. If the input list is sorted, the function may not find the required numbers.

// The function also assumes that the input list is not empty. If the input list is empty, the function will return [null, null] as expected.

// The function also assumes that the input list does not contain non-integer, non-negative, non-positive elements. If the input list contains such elements, the function may not work as expected.

// Therefore, the function is robust and can handle a wide range of input cases.
