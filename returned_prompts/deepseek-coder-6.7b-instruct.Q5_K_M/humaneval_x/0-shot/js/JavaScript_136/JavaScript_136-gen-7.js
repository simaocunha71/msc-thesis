This function uses a for loop to go through each element in the list. If the element is less than 0 and greater than the current maxNegative (or if maxNegative is null), it sets maxNegative to that element. If the element is greater than 0 and less than the current minPositive (or if minPositive is null), it sets minPositive to that element.

Finally, it returns a list containing maxNegative and minPositive.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the list, because it has to go through every element in the list once.

The space complexity is O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the maxNegative and minPositive variables.

The time complexity and space complexity of this function are both optimal for this problem.

The problem can be solved in O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.

The function takes in a list of integers and returns a list of the largest negative integer and the smallest positive integer in the list. If there are no negative or positive integers, it returns null for that value.

This problem can be solved by using a single pass through the list. The time complexity is O(n) because we need to go through each element in the
