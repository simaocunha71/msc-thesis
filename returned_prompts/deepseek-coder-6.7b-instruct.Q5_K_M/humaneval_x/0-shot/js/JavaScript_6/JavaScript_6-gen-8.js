    // Add the maximum depth of this group to the levels array

```

This code works by first splitting the input string into groups, then iterating over each group and character. When it encounters an open parenthesis, it increases the current depth, and when it encounters a close parenthesis, it decreases the current depth. If the current depth is greater than the maximum depth, the maximum depth is updated. This process is repeated for each group. The maximum depth of each group is then added to the levels array, which is returned at the end.

The output for the given example is `[2, 3, 1, 3]`, which represents the maximum depth of each of the groups in the input string.

**Time complexity: O(n)**, where n is the total number of characters in all groups.

**Space complexity: O(m)**, where m is the number of groups.
