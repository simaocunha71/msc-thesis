  let evenNum = -1;

  for (let i = x; i <= y; i++) {
    if (i % 2 === 0) {
      evenNum = i;
    }
  }

  return evenNum;
};

console.log(chooseNum(12, 15)); // 14
console.log(chooseNum(13, 12)); // -1

// The function chooseNum works by iterating over the range from x to y (inclusive).
// If the current number i is even, it sets evenNum to i. The final value of evenNum is the biggest even number in the range. 
// If there's no even number in the range, evenNum remains -1, which is returned.

/*
  Note:
  This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the range. This is because the function iterates over each number in the range once.
