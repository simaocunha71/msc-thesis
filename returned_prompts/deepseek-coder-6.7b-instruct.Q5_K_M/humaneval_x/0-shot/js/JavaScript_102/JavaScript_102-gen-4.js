// This function works by starting at the lower end of the range, x, 
// and checking each number to see if it's even and greater than the 
// current max number. If it is, it becomes the new max number. 
// The function continues to do this until it's checked all numbers in 
// the range, then returns the max number found.
// If there are no even numbers in the range, the function will return -1.

// Note: This function assumes that x and y are positive integers.
// If negative numbers or non-integer numbers are possible inputs, 
// the function will need to be adjusted accordingly.
// The function also assumes that y is greater than x.
// If x and y could be equal or x could be greater than y, the function 
// will need to be adjusted accordingly.

// This function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the range.
// This is because it checks each number in the range once.
// It has a space complexity of O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space 
// to store the maximum number found and the loop counter.
// The function is efficient for ranges of reasonable size.
// For extremely large ranges, a more efficient algorithm would be needed.
// However, this function would be suitable for ranges of reasonable size.
