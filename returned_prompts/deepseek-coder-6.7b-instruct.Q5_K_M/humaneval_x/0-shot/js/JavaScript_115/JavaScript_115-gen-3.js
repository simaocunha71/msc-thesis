  let count = 0;
  let buckets = 0;
  
  for(let i = 0; i < grid.length; i++){
    for(let j = 0; j < grid[i].length; j++){
      if(grid[i][j] === 1){
        buckets++;
      }
    }
  }
  
  while(buckets > 0){
    count++;
    buckets -= capacity;
  }
  
  return count;
}
```

## Solution
In this solution, we first count the number of wells in the grid. Then, we use a while loop to lower the buckets by the specified capacity until all wells are emptied. We return the number of times the buckets were lowered to get the result.

## Time complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n*m), where n is the number of rows in the grid and m is the number of columns in the grid. This is because we are iterating over all cells in the grid once.

## Space complexity
The space complexity of this solution is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the count of wells and the number of buckets.

## Test cases
Here are some test cases to validate the solution:

```javascript
console.log(maxFill([[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]], 1)); // expected output: 6
console.log(maxFill([[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]], 2)); // expected output: 5
console.log(maxFill([[0,0,0], [0,0,0]], 5)); // expected output: 0
```

These test cases cover a variety of scenarios, including grids with varying numbers of wells and bucket capacities.

## Discussion
This problem can be solved by simply counting the number of wells and then using a while loop to lower the buckets until all wells are emptied. The number of times the buckets were lowered is the result. This solution has
