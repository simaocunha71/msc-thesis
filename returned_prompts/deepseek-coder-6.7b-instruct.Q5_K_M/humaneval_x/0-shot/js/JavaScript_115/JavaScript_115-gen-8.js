  let count = 0;
  let water = 0;

    // loop through each column
    for (let j = 0; j < grid[0].length; j++) {
      // if the well is full
      if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
        // increase water count

**Explanation:**

This problem requires understanding of grid traversal and the properties of the given grid.

We initialize a counter variable `count` to 0. For each row in the grid, we check each cell. If the cell contains water (1), we increment `count`. Finally, we return `count` divided by the bucket capacity, rounded up, since we need to fill the bucket at least once for each `capacity` units of water.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n*m), where n is the number of rows in the grid and m is the number of columns in the grid.
The space complexity is O(1), because we only store a constant number of variables.

**Complexity Analysis:**

- Time Complexity: O(n*m), where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns in the grid. This is because we need to traverse the entire grid to count the total amount of water.

- Space Complexity: O(1), because we only need a constant amount of extra space to store our counters and variables.

**Test Cases:**

- `maxFill([[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]], 1)` returns 6.
- `maxFill([[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]], 2)` returns 5.
- `maxFill([[0,0,0], [0,0,0]
