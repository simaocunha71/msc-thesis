};

module.exports = maxFill;
```

## Solution

```javascript
const maxFill = (grid, capacity) => {
  // flatten the grid to a 1d array
  const wells = [].concat.apply([], grid);
  // sort the array in descending order
  wells.sort((a, b) => b - a);

  // initialize the count of buckets and the current capacity
  let count = 0, currentCapacity = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < wells.length; i++) {
    // if the current capacity plus the next well water is greater than the bucket capacity
    if (currentCapacity + wells[i] > capacity) {
      // increment the count of buckets
      count++;
      // reset the current capacity
      currentCapacity = 0;
    }
    // add the next well water to the current capacity
    currentCapacity += wells[i];
  }
  // return the count of buckets
  return count;
};

module.exports = maxFill;
```

## Explanation

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. Flatten the 2D grid to a 1D array `wells`.
2. Sort `wells` in descending order. This is because we want to fill the wells with the most water first.
3. Initialize `count` to 0, which represents the number of buckets needed, and `currentCapacity` to 0, which represents the current capacity of the bucket.
4. Iterate over `wells`. If the next well's water plus `currentCapacity` is greater than the bucket capacity, increment `count` and reset `currentCapacity`.
5. Add the next well's water to `currentCapacity`.
6. Return `count`.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) because of the sorting operation. The space complexity is O(n) because of the space needed to store the flattened grid.

## Test

```javascript
const maxFill = require('./maxFill');

console.log(maxFill([[0, 0
