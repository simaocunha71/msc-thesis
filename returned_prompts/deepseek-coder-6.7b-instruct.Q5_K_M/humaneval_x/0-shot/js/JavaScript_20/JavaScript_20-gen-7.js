The `findClosestElements` function sorts the input array of numbers in ascending order. Then it iterates over the sorted array, checking the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers. If the difference is less than the current minimum difference, it updates the minimum difference and the pair of numbers that resulted in this minimum difference. At the end, it returns the pair of numbers that had the smallest difference.

The time complexity of this function is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the length of the input array. The space complexity is O(1) because the function uses a constant amount of additional space.

The function is tested with the provided test cases and works as expected.

## Code:

```python
def findClosestElements(numbers):
    numbers.sort()
    minDiff = float('inf')
    closestPair = None

    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        diff = numbers[i + 1] - numbers[i]

        if diff < minDiff:
            minDiff = diff
            closestPair = (numbers[i], numbers[i + 1])

    return closestPair

print(findClosestElements([
