  let closestPair = [Infinity, Infinity];
  let minDifference = Infinity;

  numbers.sort((a, b) => a - b);

  for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length - 1; i++) {
    let difference = numbers[i + 1] - numbers[i];
    if (difference < minDifference) {
      minDifference = difference;
      closestPair = [numbers[i], numbers[i + 1]];
    }
  }

  return closestPair;
}

console.log(findClosestElements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2]))
console.log(findClosestElements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]))


A: The problem can be solved by sorting the array and then finding the two elements that are closest to each other. The closest pair will be the two elements that are the smallest difference between each other.

Here is the solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
const findClosestElements = (numbers) => {
    numbers.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    let smallestDiff = Infinity;
    let closestPair = [0, 0];

    for(let i = 0; i < numbers.length - 1; i++) {
        let diff = Math.abs(numbers[i] - numbers[i + 1]);
        if(diff < smallestDiff) {
            smallestDiff = diff;
            closestPair = [numbers[i], numbers[i + 1]];
        }
    }

    return closestPair;
}
```

In this solution, we first sort the array in ascending order. Then we initialize variables to keep track of the smallest difference and the closest pair of numbers. We iterate through the array and for each pair of numbers, we calculate the absolute difference. If this difference is smaller than the smallest difference found so far, we update the smallest difference and the closest pair. Finally, we return the closest pair.

The time complexity of this solution is
