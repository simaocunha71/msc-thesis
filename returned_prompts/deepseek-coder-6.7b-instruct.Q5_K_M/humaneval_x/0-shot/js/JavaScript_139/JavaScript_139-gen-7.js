  let result = 1;

  for (let i = n; i > 0; i--) {
    result *= factorial(i);
  }

  return result;
};

const factorial = (n) => {
  let result = 1;

  for (let i = n; i > 0; i--) {
    result *= i;
  }

  return result;
};

console.log(specialFactorial(4)); //288
console.log(specialFactorial(5)); //34560
console.log(specialFactorial(6)); //24883200

```

The function `specialFactorial()` uses a loop that starts from `n` and ends at `1`, and in each iteration it multiplies the current value of `result` by the factorial of the current value of `i`.

The function `factorial()` is a helper function that calculates the factorial of a given number.

In the end, `specialFactorial()` returns the result of the multiplication.

When running this code with the input of `4`, `5` and `6`, you will get the output of `288`, `34560` and `24883200`, which are the correct answers.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) because of the nested loops.

The space complexity is O(1) as it only uses a single variable `result` to keep track of the multiplication.

The solution is correct because the problem statement clearly defines the `specialFactorial()` function, and the examples given in the problem statement confirm that the function works as expected.

### Code:

```python
def special_factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        result *= factorial(i)
    return result

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

print(special_factorial(4))  # Output: 288
