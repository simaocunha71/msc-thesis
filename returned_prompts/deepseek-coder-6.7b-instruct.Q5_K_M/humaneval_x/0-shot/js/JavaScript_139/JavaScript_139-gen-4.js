The program first calculates the factorial of a number using a helper function. Then, it multiplies the factorial of the current number with the factorial of the next lower number until it reaches 1. This is the definition of the "brazilian factorial".

The result is stored in the variable `result` and returned by the function `specialFactorial`.

The function `factorial` is used to calculate the factorial of a number. It multiplies the number with every number lower than it until it reaches 1.

The time complexity of this program is O(n^2), because for each number from `n` to `1`, we calculate the factorial of that number, which takes O(n) time. Therefore, the total time complexity is O(n^2).

The space complexity of this program is O(1), because we only use a single variable to store the result, regardless of the size of the input.
