In this function, we first set the result to 1. Then, for each number from n to 1, we calculate its factorial and multiply the result by this factorial. The final result is the special factorial of n.

The time complexity of this function is O(n^2) because for each number from n to 1, we are performing a loop from the number itself down to 1, resulting in n*(n-1)*...*1 operations.

The space complexity is O(1) as we are only using a constant amount of space to store the result and the numbers we are using to calculate the factorial.

This function could be optimized by using dynamic programming to store the factorials of the numbers and then just multiply them together, but this would make the code more complex.
