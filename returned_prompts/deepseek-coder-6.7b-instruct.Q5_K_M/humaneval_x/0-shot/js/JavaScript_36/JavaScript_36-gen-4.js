let count = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
  if (i % 11 === 0 || i % 13 === 0) {
    count += (i.toString().match(/7/g) || []).length;
  }
}
return count;
};

This is a JavaScript solution for your problem. The function fizzBuzz takes in a number n as an argument. It then iterates over all numbers less than n, checks if they are divisible by 11 or 13, and if so, converts them to a string and counts the number of times the digit 7 appears in that string. This count is then added to a total count for all such numbers. The function returns the total count.

This solution uses the JavaScript method match() to find all occurrences of the digit 7 in each number. The match() method returns an array of matches, or null if no matches are found. The solution uses the logical OR operator to handle the case where match() returns null, by providing an empty array as the second argument to the addition operator.

The solution also uses the modulus operator (%) to check if a number is divisible by 11 or 13.

Finally, the solution uses a for loop to iterate over all numbers less than n.

I hope this helps clarify how the solution works. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask.
