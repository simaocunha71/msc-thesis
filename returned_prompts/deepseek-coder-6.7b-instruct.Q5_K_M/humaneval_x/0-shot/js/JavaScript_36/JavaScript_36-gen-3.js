// In this code, we initialize a counter to 0. Then we loop through every number less than n.
// If the number is divisible by 11 or 13, and if it contains the digit 7, we increase the counter.
// Finally, we return the counter.
// The number 7 is included in the counter if it is divisible by 11 or 13.
// This is because 11 and 13 are both prime numbers, and any number divisible by a prime number contains at least one of its digits.

// The function includes() is a built-in JavaScript method that checks if a string contains another string.
// It returns true if the string contains the other string, and false otherwise.
// In this case, we use it to check if the number i (which is a string) contains the digit 7.

// The modulus operator % is a built-in JavaScript operator that returns the remainder of a division operation.
// In this case, we use it to check if the number i is divisible by 11 or 13. If i % 11 or i % 13 is 0, then i is divisible by 11 or 13.

// The function fizzBuzz() returns the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.
// It does this by counting the number of times the digit 7 appears in numbers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.
// The function then returns this count.

// The function fizzBuzz() counts the number of times the digit 7 appears in numbers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.
