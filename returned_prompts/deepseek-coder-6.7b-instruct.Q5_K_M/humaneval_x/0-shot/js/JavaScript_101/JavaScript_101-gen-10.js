return s.split(/\W+/)
}

This JavaScript function takes a string `s` as its parameter. It uses the `split` method of the string to split the string into an array of words. The argument `/\W+/` is a regular expression that matches one or more non-word characters, effectively separating the words in the string. The function returns the resulting array of words.

For example, if `s` is "Hi, my name is John", the function will return ["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "John"].

Please note that the `split` method returns an array of strings, which are the words in the original string `s`.
