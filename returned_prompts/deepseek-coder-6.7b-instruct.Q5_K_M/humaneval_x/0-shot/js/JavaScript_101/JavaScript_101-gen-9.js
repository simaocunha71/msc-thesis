/*
  The split() method divides a string into an ordered list of substrings, puts these substrings into an array, and returns the array.
  The division is done by searching for a pattern. The pattern is provided as the first parameter in the split() method.
  Here, we're looking to divide the string at either a comma or a space.
  We do this with a regular expression, /[ ,]+/ which matches one or more of either a comma or a space.
