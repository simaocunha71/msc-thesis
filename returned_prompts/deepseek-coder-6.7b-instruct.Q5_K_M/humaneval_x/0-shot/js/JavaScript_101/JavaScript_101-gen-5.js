return s.split(/\s*[,|\s]\s*/);

};

console.log(wordsString("Hi, my name is John"));
console.log(wordsString("One, two, three, four, five, six"));
```

The function `wordsString` splits the input string `s` on any number of spaces or commas and returns an array of the resulting words. The `split` method of the String object is used to split the string into an array of words. The regular expression `/\s*[,|\s]\s*/` is used to match any sequence of spaces or commas. The `\s*` part matches any number of spaces, and the `[,|\s]` part matches a comma or a space, and the `\s*` part matches any number of spaces.

The `console.log` statements are used to test the function with the two provided examples.

This solution assumes that the input string will not contain any other special characters or numbers that could be mistaken for spaces or commas. If this is not the case, additional error checking or validation may be necessary.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because the split method traverses the string once. The space complexity is also O(n), as the split method returns an array of n words.

This solution uses JavaScript's built-in string and array methods, making it more concise and efficient.

The function can be used in any JavaScript environment where the String and Array objects are available.

Note: The vertical bars (|) in the regular expression are used to denote an OR operation. So, `[,|\s]` matches a comma or a space.

I hope this helps you understand how to solve the problem.

Good luck with your coding journey, and let me know if you have any other questions or need further clarification on anything.
