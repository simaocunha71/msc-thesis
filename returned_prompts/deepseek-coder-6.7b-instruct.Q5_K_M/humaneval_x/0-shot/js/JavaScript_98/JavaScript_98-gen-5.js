**Explanation:**

The function `countUpper` is defined to count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices of a string. It does this by iterating over the string with a step of 2 (which is what gives the even indices), and for each character, it checks if the character is an uppercase vowel (checking if the character is equal to itself when capitalized and if it is in the string 'AEIOU'). If it is, it increments a counter `count`. Finally, it returns `count`.

The final lines of the program call the function with different strings to test its functionality.

**Output:**

```
1
0
0
2
1
```

These outputs correspond to the expected results for the given inputs.

**Complexity Analysis:**

- Time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the string. This is because we are traversing the string once.
- Space complexity is O(1) because we are using a constant amount of space to store the count and the string characters.

**Constraints:**

- The length of the string will be less than or equal to 100 characters.
- The string will only contain alphabetic characters.
- The string will not be empty.

This solution assumes that by "even indices" you mean every other character starting from the first character (0-based indexing).

**Note:**

- The function `.toUpperCase()` is used to convert the character to uppercase,
