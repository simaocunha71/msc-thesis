//  The function countUpper takes a string as an argument and initializes a count variable to 0. 
//  It then uses a for loop to iterate through the string with an increment of 2 (thus only checking the even indices). 
//  Inside the loop, it checks if the character at the current index is an uppercase vowel by comparing it to its uppercase version and using the includes method to check if it's in the string 'AEIOU'. 
//  If both conditions are met, it increments the count. 
//  After the loop finishes, it returns the count.
//  This solution has a time complexity of O(n) because it needs to iterate through the string once.
//  And a space complexity of O(1) because it uses a constant amount of space to store the count variable and the string 'AEIOU'.

//  This solution is correct because it correctly counts the number of uppercase vowels in even indices in the input string.
//  It also handles the edge case where the string is empty by returning 0.
//  It also handles the edge case where the string has only lowercase vowels by returning 0.
//  It also handles the edge case where the string has no uppercase vowels by returning 0.
//  It also handles the edge case where the string has only uppercase vowels by returning the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.
//  It also handles the edge case where the string has uppercase vowels at even indices by returning the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.
