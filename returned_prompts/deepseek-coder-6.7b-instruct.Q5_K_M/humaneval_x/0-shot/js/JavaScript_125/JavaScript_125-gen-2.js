This solution works by first checking if the string contains a space. If it doesn't, we know we need to split it by commas. We do this using the split function again. If the result is not a single string after the split, we know we need to return the result of the split. If the split resulted in a single string, we count the number of lowercase letters and return this count if it is odd.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the length of the string. This is because we are iterating over each character in the string once. This is an acceptable time complexity for this problem as the string length could be up to 100 characters long.

This solution also has a space complexity of O(n) where n is the number of words/strings we return. This is because we are storing the result of the split operation in the words variable.

The solution meets the problem requirements as it correctly splits the input string into words, counts the number of lowercase letters and returns the count if it is odd or zero if it is not.
