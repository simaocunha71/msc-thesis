return (0.5 * a * h)

}

console.log(triangleArea(5, 3));


//Explanation: The area of a triangle is given by the formula 0.5 * base * height. So we just need to plug in the given values of side (base) and high (height) into this formula and return the result.

```

This will return 7.5 as the area of the triangle.
