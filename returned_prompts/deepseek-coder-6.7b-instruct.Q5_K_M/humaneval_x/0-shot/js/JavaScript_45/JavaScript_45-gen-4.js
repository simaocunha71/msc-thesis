A: I think the code you've written is correct, but the problem is in the prompt.

"Given length of a side and high return area for a triangle."

This means you should be using the formula for the area of a triangle, which is 1/2 * base * height. However, in your code, you're using the formula for the area of a triangle with a right angle at the base, which is 1/2 * base * perpendicular height (which is the same as height in this case).

So, the corrected code is:

```javascript
const triangleArea = (base, height) => {
  return 0.5 * base * height;
}

triangleArea(5, 3);  // returns 7.5
```

This code will return the area of a triangle with given base and height.

Alternatively, if you're looking for the area of a triangle with a right angle at the base, you can use the formula 1/2 * base * height.

```javascript
const triangleArea = (base, height) => {
  return 0.5 * base * height;
}

triangleArea(5, 3);  // returns 7.5
```

This code will return the area of a triangle with given base and height.

I hope this helps. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask.

Note: In the context of the prompt, both pieces of code will return the same result. The difference is that one uses the formula for a triangle with a right angle at the base, while the other uses the formula for a triangle with any angle.

This is a common mistake in geometry, so be careful when using these formulas.

In a triangle with a right angle at the base, the height is the same as the perpendicular height. In other words, the height of the triangle is the same as the height given in the prompt. The base and height given in the prompt are used correctly in both pieces of code.

The mistake is in the wording of the prompt, not in the code.

I hope this helps. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask.
