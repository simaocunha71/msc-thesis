return (0.5 * a * h);

};
console.log(triangleArea(5, 3));


A: The question is asking for the area of a triangle given the length of one side (a) and the height (h). The formula for finding the area of a triangle is 0.5 * base * height. So, you return the product of 0.5, the length of the side (a) and the height (h) divided by 2.

const triangleArea = (a, h) => {
return (0.5 * a * h);
};

console.log(triangleArea(5, 3)); // Outputs: 7.5

Here, the function takes two arguments: the length of one side of the triangle (a) and the height of the triangle (h). It returns the product of 0.5, the length of one side, and the height divided by 2.

In the last line, we call the function with the arguments 5 and 3. The output of the program will be 7.5, which is the area of the triangle.

Hope this helps.

A: Your code is correct. This function takes two parameters a and h, which represent the base and height of the triangle respectively. The formula to calculate the area of a triangle is 0.5 * base * height.
So, when you call the function triangleArea(5, 3), it calculates the area of the triangle correctly.
The output of the program is 7.5, which is the area of the triangle.
So, your code is correct and it will work as expected.

A: You have a small syntax error. You need to put parenthesis around the return statement. Also, the formula for calculating the area of a triangle is base * height * 0.5.
Here is the corrected code:
const triangleArea = (a, h) => {
  return (a * h * 0.5);
};

console.log(triangleArea(5, 3)); // Outputs: 7.5

In this code, (a * h * 0.5) is the formula for calculating the area of a triangle.
The function triangleArea is defined with two parameters, a and h, which represent the base and height of the triangle
