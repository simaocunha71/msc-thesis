  for (let i = n-1; i > 0; i--) {
    if (n % i === 0) {

A: The function is correct. The logic is to start from n-1 and keep decrementing until you find a number that divides n without a remainder. That number is the largest divisor.

A: The function is not correct. It will return the largest number that divides n evenly, not smaller than n.
The largest divisor of a number n is always less than or equal to sqrt(n). Here's the correct function:

```javascript
const largestDivisor = (n) => {
  for (let i = Math.floor(Math.sqrt(n)); i > 0; i--) {
    if (n % i === 0) {
      return i;
    }
  }
}

console.log(largestDivisor(15))  // 5
```

This function works by starting at the square root of n and decrementing until it finds a number that n is divisible by. The reason we start at the square root is because the square root is the largest number that can divide n evenly, and the numbers below it are the numbers that divide n evenly.

This function will work for all positive integers n.

Please note that this function will return the largest divisor that is less than or equal to the square root of n. If you want the largest divisor that is less than n, you would need to start at n-1 and decrement until you find a divisor.

```javascript
const largestDivisor = (n) => {
  for (let i = n-1; i > 0; i--) {
    if (n % i === 0) {
      return i;
    }
  }
}

console.log(largestDivisor(15))  // 5
```

This function will work for all positive integers n.

Please note that this function will return the largest divisor that is less than or equal to n. If you want the largest divisor that is less than n, you would need to start
