  for (let i = n - 1; i > 0; i--) {
    if (n % i === 0) {
      return i;

// Test the function
console.log(largestDivisor(15)); // 5
console.log(largestDivisor(20)); // 5
console.log(largestDivisor(17)); // 1
console.log(largestDivisor(24)); // 8
console.log(largestDivisor(12)); // 6
```

This function works by iterating from `n - 1` down to `1`. For each number `i`, it checks if `n` is divisible by `i` using the modulus operator `%`. If it is, it returns `i` as the largest divisor.

This function assumes that the input is a positive integer greater than 1. If the input is not valid, the function may not behave as expected.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), as it iterates from `n - 1` down to `1`. The space complexity is O(1), as it uses a constant amount of space.

The function is correct, but it's not the most efficient way to find the largest divisor of a number. There are more efficient algorithms for this, such as the Euclidean algorithm.

This function is a good introduction to the concept of iterating and using the modulus operator in JavaScript.

Note: This function is not suitable for finding the largest divisor of large numbers, as it has a time complexity of O(n).
