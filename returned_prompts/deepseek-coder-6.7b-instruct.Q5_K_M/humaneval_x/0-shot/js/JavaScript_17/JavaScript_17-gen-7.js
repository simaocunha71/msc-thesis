  // split the music_string into individual notes
  let notes = music_string.split(' ');
  let beat_list = [];

  // iterate over each note
  for (let note of notes) {

      // check the note and add the corresponding number of beats to beat_list
      if (note === 'o') beat_list.push(4);
      else if (note === 'o|') beat_list.push(2);
      else if (note === '.|') beat_list.push(1);

  }

  // return the list of beats
  return beat_list;
}

console.log(parseMusic('o o| .| o| o| .| .| .| .| o o'));
```

This code works by first splitting the input string into individual notes. It then iterates over each note and checks its value, adding the corresponding number of beats to a list. Finally, it returns the list of beats.

The time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the number of notes in the input string. This is because it makes a single pass over the input string. The space complexity is also O(n), as it stores the list of beats.

If you want to make it more efficient, you can replace the if-else statements with a dictionary or a switch-case statement. This will reduce the time complexity to O(1) for each note, as it will look up the value in constant time.

Note: This code assumes that the input string is well-formed and does not contain any unexpected characters. If this is not the case, you should add error checking to handle these cases.
