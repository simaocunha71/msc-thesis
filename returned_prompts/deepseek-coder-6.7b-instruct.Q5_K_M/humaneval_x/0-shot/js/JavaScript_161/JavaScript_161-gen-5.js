**Solution Explanation:**
The function takes a string as input and converts it to an array of characters. It then loops through each character in the array and checks if it is a letter using the `match(/[a-z]/i)` method. If it is a letter, it then checks if the letter is uppercase or lowercase using the `=== array[i].toUpperCase()` condition. If it is uppercase, it is converted to lowercase, and if it is lowercase, it is converted to uppercase. Finally, the array of characters is joined back into a string using the `.join('')` method and returned as the result.

If the string contains no letters, the array is returned as it is, since no changes are made. This is because the `match(/[a-z]/i)` method will return null for an empty string, and the null value is falsy, so the `if` condition will not be entered. The string is reversed in this case.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string.

**Note:** The `match(/[a-z]/i)` method is used to check if a character is a letter. The `/[a-z]/i` regular expression matches any character that is a lowercase letter from a to z or an uppercase letter from A to Z. The `i` flag makes the match case-insensitive.
