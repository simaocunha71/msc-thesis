  arr.sort((a, b) => b - a)
  return arr.slice(0, k)

}

console.log(maximum([-3, -4, 5], 3)) // [-4, -3, 5]
console.log(maximum([4, -4, 4], 2)) // [4, 4]
console.log(maximum([-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1], 1)) // [2]

// The time complexity of the above solution is O(n log n) because of the sorting function.
// The space complexity of the solution is O(k), where k is the number of elements in the returned array.
// This solution assumes that the array is sorted in descending order initially.

```

**Explanation:**
The given problem requires us to return a sorted list of 'k' maximum numbers from the given list of integers. We are given an array of integers and we need to return a list of 'k' maximum numbers from the array.

We can solve this problem by sorting the array in descending order and then slicing the first 'k' elements from the sorted array. The sorted function is used to sort the array in descending order. The slice function is used to get the first 'k' elements from the sorted array.

**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity of the above solution is O(n log n) because of the sorting function.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity of the solution is O(k), where k is the number of elements in the returned array.

This solution assumes that the array is sorted in descending order initially.

The approach of the problem is quite simple and efficient. We are using the built-in sort function to sort the array in descending order and then we are slicing the first 'k' elements from the sorted array.

I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any questions.
