This function first initializes the first four numbers of the sequence. It then enters a loop that continues until it has generated n + 1 numbers. If the current index is even, the next number is one plus the previous number. If the current index is odd, the next number is the sum of the previous two numbers plus the next number. Finally, the function returns the sequence.
The function uses a for loop to generate the sequence. The loop starts at the fourth number (index 4) and continues until it has generated n + 1 numbers. The loop uses the modulus operator to determine if the current index is even or odd. The modulus operator returns the remainder of the division of the index by 2. If the remainder is 0, the index is even, otherwise it is odd.
The function uses the push method to add the next number to the sequence. The push method adds the next number to the end of the sequence.
The function returns the sequence.
