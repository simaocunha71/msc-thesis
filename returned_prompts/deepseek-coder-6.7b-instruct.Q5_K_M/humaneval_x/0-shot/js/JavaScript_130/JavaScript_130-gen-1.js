  let result = [1, 3, 2];
  for(let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    result[i] = i % 2 === 0 ? 1 + i / 2 : result[i - 1] + result[i - 2] + result[i - 3];
  }
  return result;
}

tri(3); // [1, 3, 2, 8]
tri(10); // [1, 3, 2, 8, 14, 26, 48, 88, 160, 304, 576]
```

This solution uses the standard Fibonacci sequence logic and simply tweaks it slightly to fit the Tribonacci sequence. The result array is initialized with the first three numbers of the Tribonacci sequence. The for loop then iterates from 3 to n, calculating the next number in the sequence based on whether the current index is even or odd. If it's even, the number is calculated as 1 + n / 2. If it's odd, the number is calculated as the sum of the previous three numbers in the sequence. This is done by indexing into the result array using the appropriate indices. Finally, the result array is returned.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), where n is the input number.

## Solution

Here is the JavaScript solution for the problem:

```javascript
const tri = (n) => {
  let result = [3, 2, 1];
  for(let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    result[i] = i % 2 === 0 ? 1 + i / 2 : result[i - 1] + result[i - 2] + result[i - 3];
  }
  return result;
}
```

This function starts by initializing the `result` array with the first three numbers of the Tribonacci sequence. It then enters a loop that iterates from the third number (index 3) up to and including the nth number. In the loop, it checks if the current index `i` is even or odd
