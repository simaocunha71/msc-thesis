The solution works by counting the number of open and closed parentheses in the two strings. Then it checks if the number of open parentheses in the first string is greater than or equal to the number of closed parentheses in the second string, and if the number of open parentheses in the second string is greater than or equal to the number of closed parentheses in the first string. If either of these conditions are true, it returns 'Yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'No'.


This code makes use of JavaScript's Array.prototype.match() function to count the number of open and closed parentheses in each string. The regular expression /\(\)/g is used to match all instances of open or closed parentheses in the string. The match() function returns an array of all matches, or null if no matches are found. The length property is then used to get the number of elements in the array (which is the number of matches).


The ternary operator (?:) is used to simplify the if-else statement. It checks if the first condition is true, and if so, returns 'Yes
