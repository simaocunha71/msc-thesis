      return false;
    } else {
      stack.pop();
    }

  return stack.length === 0;

console.log(correctBracketing("(")); // false

This solution uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets. If an opening bracket is encountered, it is pushed onto the stack. If a closing bracket is encountered, it is assumed to correspond to the most recent opening bracket on the stack, so the opening bracket is popped off the stack. If at any point a closing bracket is encountered but there is no matching opening bracket, the function returns false. If the stack is empty at the end, all brackets were matched correctly, so the function returns true.



A: You could solve this problem by using a stack data structure. The stack can be used to keep track of the opening brackets. When a closing bracket is encountered, you can check if the stack is not empty and the top element of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket. If it is, you pop the top element from the stack. If it's not, or if the stack is empty, it means that the brackets are not correctly nested, so you return false. If you finish going through all the characters without returning false, it means that all brackets are correctly nested, so you return true.

Here is the JavaScript code that implements the above approach:

```javascript
function correctBracketing(str) {
    let stack = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
        if (str[i] === '(') {
            stack.push(str[i]);
        } else if (str[i] === ')' && stack.length > 0 && stack[stack.length - 1] === '(') {
            stack.pop
