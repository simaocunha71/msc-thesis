## Explanation

The problem requires finding the minimum path of length k in a grid. This can be solved using depth-first search (DFS). 

We start from each cell of the grid and perform a DFS to find the minimum path of length k. We use the variable `minPath` to store the minimum path we found and `minDist` to store the length of this path.

In the DFS function, we first check if the current path is longer than k or if its length is equal to `minDist` but its last element is greater than the last element of `minPath`. If either is true, we return early.

Then we check if the current cell is out of the grid. If it is, we also return early.

Next, we add the value of the current cell to the path and if the path's length is equal to k, we update `minDist` and `minPath`.

Then we recursively call DFS for each of the current cell's neighbors.

Finally, we remove the current cell from
