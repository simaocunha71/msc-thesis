  // Initialize the grid as a 1D array

The code first flattens the grid into a 1D array to make it easier to manage. It then creates an empty array to store the minimum path. It enters a loop that runs k times, each time finding the minimum value in the flattened grid, adding it to the result array, and removing it from the grid. Finally, it returns the result array, which contains the values in the minimum path.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) because we are looping through the flattened grid n times to find the minimum value, and we are removing a value from the grid in each iteration. The space complexity is O(n) because we are storing the values in the flattened grid and the result array.

This solution assumes that the input grid is a 2D array of integers and that k is a positive integer.

Please note that this solution does not consider the actual positions of the cells in the grid, but rather the values in each cell. Therefore, if there are two cells with the
