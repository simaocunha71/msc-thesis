## Solution Explanation:
The solution iterates over the first half of the array, comparing each element with its corresponding element from the end of the array. 
If the elements aren't the same, the count is incremented. At the end of the iteration, the function returns the count, which represents the minimum number of changes required to make the array palindromic.

## Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the array. This is because it needs to iterate over half of the array once. 

The space complexity of this solution is O(1), since no additional space is required that scales with the size of the input.

## Testing:
Testing is done using the provided test cases. The function should return the correct number of changes required to make the array palindromic for all inputs.

```javascript
console.log(smallestChange([1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6])) // 4
console.log(smallestChange([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2])) // 1
console.log(smallestChange([1, 2, 3, 2, 1])) // 0
```

These test cases cover different scenarios: an array that is not palindromic, an array that is almost palindromic, and an already palindromic array.

## Edge Cases:
The function should handle arrays of any length, including
