  return strings.filter(string => string.startsWith(prefix));

};

// Test cases
console.log(filterByPrefix([], 'a')); // []
console.log(filterByPrefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a')); // ['abc', 'array']
```

This solution uses the `Array.prototype.filter()` method in JavaScript, which creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. In this case, the test is that the string starts with the specified prefix.

The function `startsWith()` is used to check if the string starts with the specified prefix.

The function `filterByPrefix()` is then exported to be used in other modules.

The test cases are used to verify that the function works as expected.

This solution assumes that the input is always an array of strings and a string as prefix. If the input is not of the expected type, the function may not work as expected.

Also, be aware that the `startsWith()` method is case sensitive. If you want to make it case insensitive, you can convert both the string and prefix to the same case (usually lower case) before checking.
