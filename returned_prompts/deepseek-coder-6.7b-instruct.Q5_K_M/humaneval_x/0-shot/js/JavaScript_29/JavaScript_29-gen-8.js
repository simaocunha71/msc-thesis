  return strings.filter(string => string.startsWith(prefix));
}

module.exports = filterByPrefix;

This is a simple solution using JavaScript's built-in filter and startsWith methods. It filters the input array by checking whether each string starts with the specified prefix.

It's a function that takes two parameters - the array of strings and the prefix. It uses the filter method on the array, which creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. In this case, the test is whether the string starts with the specified prefix.

The function startsWith is a built-in JavaScript method that checks if a string starts with a specified string.

This function is then exported for use in other modules.
