This is a simple implementation of a stack in JavaScript. We iterate over the input string and push each '<' onto the stack. If we encounter a '>', we check if the stack is empty. If it is, we return false as there is no corresponding '<'. If the stack is not empty, we pop the last '<' from the stack. At the end of the iteration, if the stack is empty, we return true, indicating that every '<' has a corresponding '>'. If the stack is not empty, we return false.

This code will work for any valid string of '<' and '>'. It checks that every '<' has a corresponding '>', and that there are no '>'s without a corresponding '<'.

This code runs in O(n) time, where n is the length of the input string. It also uses O(n) space to store the stack.

The stack is used here because it has the property of "last in, first out". In this case, we want to check that every '<' has a corresponding '>', which means we want to check the order of the brackets. A stack is the perfect data structure for this use case.

The code also handles the edge case of an empty string, returning true since there are no brackets.

This code is correct as per the problem statement.
