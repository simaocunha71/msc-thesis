**Explanation:**

This JavaScript function works by sorting the characters in the input strings and comparing the sorted strings. If the sorted strings are identical, the function returns `true`, indicating that the input words share the same characters. If the sorted strings are not identical, the function returns `false`.

The sort method sorts the characters in the string in lexicographic order, which means it sorts the characters as if they were in an alphabet. The `join('')` method then combines the sorted characters back into a string.

The `===` operator is used to compare the sorted strings, which returns `true` if they are identical and `false` otherwise.

This approach works because it doesn't matter what order the characters appear in the original strings, as long as they have the same characters, the sorted strings will be identical.

The time complexity of this function is O(n log n) because of the sorting operation. The space complexity is O(n) because of the additional space required to store the sorted strings.

Here is a more efficient solution using a frequency counter:

```javascript
const sameChars = (s0, s1) => {
  const counter = {};

  for (let char of s0) {
    counter[char] = (counter[char] || 0) + 1;
  }

  for (
