*/

// Explanation:
// The function antiShuffle takes a string s as input.
// We use the JavaScript built-in method split('') to split the string into an array of characters.
// Then, we sort the characters in the array using the sort() method. We pass a comparator function to sort() that compares the ASCII values of the characters.
// The sort() method rearranges the array elements in the place, sorting them in ascending order.
// Finally, we join the array elements back into a string using the join('') method and return the result.
// This way, all characters in the string are sorted in ascending order based on their ASCII values, but the order of the words in the sentence is preserved.

// For example, for the string 'Hello World!!!', the characters are first sorted as ' !!!!HWdeloort', then the words are rearranged to 'Hello  !!!!Wdlor'.
// This gives us the desired result.

// Note: This solution assumes that the string only contains alphabets and special characters. If the string contains digits or other special characters, the behavior of the function might be unexpected.

// Also, this solution is case-sensitive. All uppercase letters come before lowercase letters in ASCII order. If this is not the desired behavior, you can modify the comparator function to handle uppercase and lowercase letters equivalently.

// This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the length of the string.
// It has a space complexity of O(n) because it creates a new array of characters to sort.
// So, it should work reasonably well for most common use cases.

// Note: This is a JavaScript solution. The problem could be solved in other programming languages as well.
