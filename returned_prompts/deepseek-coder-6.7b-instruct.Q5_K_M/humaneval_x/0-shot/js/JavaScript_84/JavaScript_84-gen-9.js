// Explanation:
// We are converting the number to binary and then summing up all the digits of that binary number.
// The while loop continues until N is 0, and the sum of the digits is calculated.
// The toString(2) method is used to convert the sum to binary.


//The output will be:
//1
//110
//1100

//This output represents the sum of digits in binary of the input numbers.
