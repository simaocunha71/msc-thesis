  return lst.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + Math.pow(Math.ceil(curr), 2), 0);

};

console.log(sumSquares([1,2,3]));
console.log(sumSquares([1,4,9]));
console.log(sumSquares([1,3,5,7]));
console.log(sumSquares([1.4,4.2,0]));
console.log(sumSquares([-2.4,1,1]));

// The Math.ceil() function rounds a number up to the next largest integer.
// The Math.pow() function returns the base to the exponent power.
// The reduce() function is used to apply a function to an accumulator and each element in the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single value.


A: The question is asking to round each element of the array to the nearest integer, then square it, and then sum all those squared values.

Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
const sumSquares = lst => {
  return lst.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + Math.pow(Math.ceil(curr), 2), 0);
};

console.log(sumSquares([1,2,3])); // 14
console.log(sumSquares([1,4,9])); // 98
console.log(sumSquares([1,3,5,7])); // 84
console.log(sumSquares([1.4,4.2,0])); // 29
console.log(sumSquares([-2.4,1,1])); // 6
```

In this solution, the reduce function is used to iterate over each element of the array. For each element, Math.ceil is used to round up to the nearest integer, then Math.pow is used to square that number. The results are then added to an accumulator which is returned at the end of the iteration.

The Math.pow function takes two arguments, the base and the exponent, and returns the base raised to the power of the exponent. In
