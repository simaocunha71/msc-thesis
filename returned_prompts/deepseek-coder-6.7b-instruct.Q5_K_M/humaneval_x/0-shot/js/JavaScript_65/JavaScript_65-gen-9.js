This function works by first converting the integer into an array of its digits using `String(x).split('')`. It then checks whether the shift is greater than or equal to the number of digits. If so, it simply reverses the digit array and joins it back into a string. If not, it slices the array into two parts at the shift index and concatenates them in reverse order, then joins the result back into a string.

The slice and concatenate operations create a new array, so the original array remains unchanged. The complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of digits in x.

The function is tested with various inputs, including edge cases, to ensure its correctness.


## Code Explanation

1. First, we convert the input integer to a string and split it into an array of characters, each representing a digit.

2. We then check if the shift is greater than or equal to the length of the array.

3. If it is, we reverse the array and join it back into a string.

4. If it's not, we split the array into two parts at the shift index and concatenate them in reverse order, then join the result back into a string.

5. We return the result.

The function is then tested with various inputs to ensure its correctness.


## Code Review

The code is well-written and efficient. It correctly handles the edge case where the shift is greater than or equal to the number of digits by reversing the dig
