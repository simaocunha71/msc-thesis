  return text.replace(/[aeiouAEIOU]/g, '');

};

module.exports = removeVowels;
```

The function `removeVowels` takes a string as its argument and returns the same string, but without any vowels.

It uses the JavaScript `replace` method with a regular expression to match all occurrences of the vowels (both lowercase and uppercase). The `/[aeiouAEIOU]/g` regular expression matches any vowel, and the `g` flag indicates that it should match globally across the string (not just the first occurrence).

The `replace` method replaces each matched vowel with an empty string (`''`), effectively removing it from the string.

The function is then exported so that it can be used in other files.
