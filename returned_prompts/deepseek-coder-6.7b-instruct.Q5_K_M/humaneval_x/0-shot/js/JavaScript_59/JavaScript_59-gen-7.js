This solution works by continuously dividing the input number by the smallest possible prime factor (starting at 2) until no further factors can be found. The remaining value is the largest prime factor of the original number.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) because in the worst-case scenario, it will have to iterate through all the numbers up to n to find the largest prime factor.

The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the current factor and the input number.

This solution assumes that the input number is greater than 1 and is not a prime number, as per the problem description. If the input number is a prime number, the function will return 1 as the largest prime factor, which is not correct.

Note: This function does not handle negative numbers or zero. If you need to handle these cases, you should add additional error checking at the beginning of the function.

Also, the function uses a while loop instead of a for loop. This is because we don't know how many iterations we need to perform in advance.

In JavaScript, the remainder operator is used (%), which returns the remainder of the division of the two operands.

The function uses a do-while loop to repeatedly divide the number by the factor until it can no longer be divided evenly. The last factor that was used was the largest prime factor.

The function uses the increment operator (++) to increment the factor by 1 after each iteration. This is necessary to ensure that the function checks each potential factor in order.

The function returns the factor after the loop has completed. This is the largest prime factor of the original number.

The function is designed to be reusable and can be used for any integer greater than 1.

The function is well-documented with comments explaining the purpose and functionality of each part of the
