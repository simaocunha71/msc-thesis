A: The function takes three arguments which are lengths of the sides of a triangle. The lengths are sorted in ascending order. This is done because the Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. 

The function then returns the result of the Pythagorean theorem check, which will be true if the triangle is right-angled and false otherwise.

This function can be used to check if a triangle is right-angled by providing the lengths of its sides as arguments. 

Here is the function again for reference:

```javascript
const rightAngleTriangle = (a, b, c) => {
  let sides = [a, b, c].sort((a, b) => a - b);
  return Math.pow(sides[0], 2) + Math.pow(sides[1], 2) === Math.pow(sides[2], 2);
};
```

You can use the function like this:

```javascript
console.log(rightAngleTriangle(3, 4, 5)); // true
console.log(rightAngleTriangle(1, 2, 3)); // false
```

In the first example, the function returns true because a triangle with sides of lengths 3, 4, and 5 is right-angled. In the second example, the function returns false because a triangle with sides of lengths 1, 2, and 3 is not right-angled.

Note: This function assumes that the inputs are valid lengths of a triangle. If the inputs are invalid (such as negative lengths or the sum of the lengths of two sides being less than or
