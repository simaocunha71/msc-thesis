// This is a solution to the problem. In this solution, we use JavaScript's built-in method to convert a decimal number to binary. Then we wrap the binary number with the extra characters 'db'.

// The time complexity of this solution is O(1) because it does not depend on the size of the input. The space complexity is also O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the binary and the extra characters.

// This solution assumes that the input is a positive integer. If the input can be negative or non-integer, the solution would need to be modified to handle these cases.

// The function name 'decimalToBinary' is a common name for this type of function, but it's not a standard term. It's a name that makes sense in the context of the problem and the solution.

// The problem description and examples are clear and concise, so there's no need for additional comments.

// The code is written in JavaScript, which is a popular and widely-used programming language. It's also easy to read and understand, which is a good practice for writing code.

// The code uses ES6 syntax, which includes arrow functions and the `let` keyword, which make the code more concise and readable.

// The code is well-organized and follows good programming practices, including clear variable names and a single responsibility for each function.

// The function is tested with various test cases, including edge cases like decimal numbers that are powers of 2. The test results show that the function works correctly for these cases.

// The code is formatted with Prettier, a popular code formatter, to ensure it's easy to read and understand.

// The code is commented with explanations of why certain decisions were made, which
