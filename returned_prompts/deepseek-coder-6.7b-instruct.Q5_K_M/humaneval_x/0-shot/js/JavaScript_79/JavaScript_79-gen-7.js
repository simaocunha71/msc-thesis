The toString() method is used to convert a number into a string. The method takes a radix as an argument, which specifies the base of the number system to use. In this case, the radix is 2 to convert the number to binary.

The binary string is then concatenated with 'db' at the beginning and end of the string to meet the problem's requirements.

Finally, the function is tested with some sample inputs and the results are printed to the console.

In JavaScript, the radix for toString() is optional, and if not provided, it defaults to 10.

The radix can be any integer between 2 and 36. For example, 2 for binary, 8 for octal, 16 for hexadecimal, etc.

If the radix is out of range, a RangeError will be thrown.

So, decimalToBinary(15) will convert the decimal number 15 to binary and return it as a string. The binary number is then wrapped with 'db' to meet the problem's requirements.

Similarly, decimalToBinary(32) converts the decimal number 32 to binary and returns it as a string, with 'db' wrapping it.

This process is repeated with the numbers 255, 1024, etc. to test the function with different inputs.

The function outputs the binary equivalent of the input decimal number, wrapped with 'db' to meet the problem's requirements.

The output will be a binary string starting with 'db' and ending with 'db'. Each character in the middle represents a binary digit.

This function works for any positive decimal number. If you try it with a negative
