// This function works by using the built-in JavaScript function `toString()` on the input decimal number. 
// This function converts the decimal number to a binary string. The `slice(2)` then removes the '0b' at the start of the binary string. 
// Finally, the 'db' is added to both ends of the binary string to meet the problem's requirements.

```

The function is created using JavaScript (JS) syntax. It takes a single argument `decimal` which is the decimal number to be converted to binary. The `toString(2)` method is used to convert the decimal to a binary string and the `slice(2)` method removes the '0b' from the start of the string. The 'db' is then added to the start and end of the binary string.

The function returns the binary string in the format specified by the problem.

The time complexity of this function is O(log(n)) as the `toString(2)` method runs in O(log(n)) time. The space complexity is also O(log(n)) as the binary string takes up O(log(n)) space.

The function can be tested by running it with different decimal inputs. It should return the correct binary representation of the input decimal number.

The function can be used in any JavaScript program that requires decimal to binary conversion.
