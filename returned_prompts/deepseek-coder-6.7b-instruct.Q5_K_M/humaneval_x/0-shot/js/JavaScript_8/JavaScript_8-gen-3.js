// This is a solution for the question. The function sumProduct takes an array of integers as input and returns a tuple with the sum and the product of the integers in the array. If the array is empty, the sum is 0 and the product is 1.

// The for loop iterates over the array and adds each integer to the sum and multiplies the product by the integer. The final sums and product are returned as a tuple.

// The function uses the += and *= operators to add and multiply the integers to the sum and product respectively. The sum and product variables are initialized to 0 and 1 respectively.

// The function is then tested with an empty array and an array of integers. The expected output is returned for both cases.

// If you run the code, it will print:
// (0, 1)
// (10, 24)
// which are the expected outputs.

// Note: The function was modified to take only one argument, an array of integers. The original function had an additional argument, "int", which was not used. I have left the modification in the code for reference.

// Also note: This solution assumes that all elements in the array are integers. If the array may contain non
