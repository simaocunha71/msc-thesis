/*
  This function starts by creating an array of the planets from closest to the sun.
  Then it finds the index of the two given planets in this array. If one or both
  of the planets are not found, the function returns an empty tuple.
  Otherwise, it slices the array from the next planet to the closest one and returns it.
  The slice method takes two arguments: the start and end index of the slice.
  The start index is the smaller of the two indices, and the end index is the larger one.
  The '+1' is used to include the planet that comes directly after the closest one.
  The 'Math.min' and 'Math.max' functions are used to find the smallest and largest
  of the two indices.

A: Here's a simplified version of the function that should work:

```javascript
const bf = (planet1, planet2) => {
    const planets = ["Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus", "Neptune"];
    
    if(!planets.includes(planet1) || !planets.includes(planet2)) {
        return ();
    }

    const start = Math.min(planets.indexOf(planet1), planets.indexOf(planet2));
    const end = Math.max(planets.indexOf(planet1), planets.indexOf(planet2));

    return planets.slice(start + 1, end);
}
```

In this version, the function first checks if either of the input planet names are included in the `planets` array
