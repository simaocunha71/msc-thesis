A: The problem is asking to sum up all the odd numbers that are at even positions in the array. The even positions are the 0-indexed positions, so elements at positions 0, 2, 4, etc. are at even positions. 

The provided solution is correct, and it uses the modulus operator to check if the number at an even position is odd. The modulus operator returns the remainder of the division of the first argument by the second. If a number is odd, the remainder of the division by 2 will be 1. 

So, if lst[i] % 2 !== 0 is true, then lst[i] is an odd number at an even position, and lst[i] is added to the sum.

If you want to use a more functional approach, you can use the Array.prototype.reduce method to achieve the same result:

```javascript
const solution = lst => lst.reduce((sum, num, i) => i % 2 === 0 && num % 2 !== 0 ? sum + num : sum, 0);
```
This does the same thing as the for loop in the provided solution, but in a more concise way.

The reduce method takes a callback function that is called for each element in the array. The callback function takes three arguments: the current sum (which is the accumulated result from the previous callback calls), the current number, and the current index. 

The callback function checks if the index is even and the number is odd, and if so, adds the number to the sum. If not, it just returns the current sum.

The second argument to reduce is the initial value of the sum (which is
