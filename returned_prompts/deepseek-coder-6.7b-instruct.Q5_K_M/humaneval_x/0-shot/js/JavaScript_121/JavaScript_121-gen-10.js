// This solution iterates through the array with a step of 2, so it only takes into account the elements in even positions. 
// It then checks if the current element is odd (by checking if the remainder of its division by 2 is not 0), and if so, adds it to the sum.
// Finally, it returns the sum.

// The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input list. This is because it iterates through the list exactly once.
// The space complexity is O(1), because it uses a constant amount of space to store the sum and the index, and does not create any additional data structures that scale with the input size.

// This solution is correct because it correctly sums the odd numbers in even positions of the input list.
