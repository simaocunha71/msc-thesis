console.log(solution([5, 8, 7, 1])) //==> 12

// Explanation

/*

In this problem, we're given a list of integers and we need to sum all the odd numbers that are in even positions. We can do this by iterating through the list, checking if each number is odd and if it's in an even position (i.e., at index 0, 2, 4, etc.). If both conditions are met, we add the number to our sum.
