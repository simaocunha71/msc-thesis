This solution finds the smallest element of the list and removes it from the list. It then finds the smallest element of the remaining list, which is the second smallest element.

This solution assumes that the input list is not sorted and that the smallest and second smallest elements are not the same. If the smallest and second smallest elements are the same, the function will return null.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) because it needs to find the minimum and second minimum elements of the list, where n is the length of the list. The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of extra space.
