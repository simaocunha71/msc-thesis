// Time complexity: O(n)
// Space complexity: O(1)

// The function iterates through the list only once, and keeps track of the smallest and the second smallest elements.
// It then returns the second smallest element. If no such element exists, it returns null.

// The time complexity is O(n) because the function must examine each element in the list at least once.
// The space complexity is O(1) because the function uses a constant amount of space to store the min and second_min variables.

// This solution assumes that the list contains distinct elements. If the list can contain duplicate elements, additional checks would be needed to ensure that the second smallest element is not a duplicate of the smallest element.

// This solution also assumes that the list is not sorted. If the list is sorted, the function could be simplified by directly accessing the second element without needing to traverse the list.

// This solution also assumes that the list contains at least two elements. If the list contains fewer than two elements, the function returns null immediately.

// This solution assumes that the list contains only integers. If the list contains non-integer elements, additional type checking would be needed.

// This solution assumes that the list does not contain negative numbers. If the list can contain negative numbers, the function would need to handle these cases.
