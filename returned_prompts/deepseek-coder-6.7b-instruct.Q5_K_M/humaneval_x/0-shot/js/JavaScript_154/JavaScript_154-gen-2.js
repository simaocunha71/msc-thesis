// This solution works by iterating over the length of the second word (b). In each iteration, it checks if the first word (a) includes the current rotation of the second word (b). If it does, the function returns true. If not, it rotates the second word and continues. If the function finishes iterating without finding a match, it returns false.
// The time complexity is O(n*m), where n is the length of the first word and m is the length of the second word. This is because in the worst case, it needs to check every possible rotation of the second word in the first word.
// The space complexity is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the input words and a single variable.

// Note: This solution assumes that the input words are all lowercase and do not contain any special characters. If this is not the case, you may need to add additional error checking or preprocessing to handle this.


// The solution is based on the following idea:
// We are given two words a and b. We need to check whether b or any of its rotations is a substring of a.
// We can solve this by iterating over the length of b and checking if a includes b in each iteration. If it does, we return true. If not, we rotate b and continue. If we finish iterating without finding a match, we return false.

// The time complexity of this solution is O(n*m), where n is the length of a and m is the length of b. This is because in the worst case,
