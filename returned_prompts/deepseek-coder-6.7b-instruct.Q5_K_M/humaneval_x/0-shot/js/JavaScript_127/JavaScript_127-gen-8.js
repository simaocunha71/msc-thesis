In the given problem, we need to find the intersection of two given intervals. If the intersection does not exist or the length of the intersection is 1, we return "NO". If the length of the intersection is a prime number, we return "YES", otherwise we return "NO".

To find the intersection, we take the maximum of the start points of the two intervals and the minimum of the end points of the two intervals. The length of the intersection is the difference between these two points.

If the length of the intersection is a prime number, we need to check whether it is a prime number or not. To do this, we start a loop from 2 to the square root of the length of the intersection and check if the length of the intersection is divisible by any number in this range. If it is divisible, it means the length of the intersection is not a prime number and we return "NO". If the length of the intersection is not divisible by any number in the range, it means the length of the intersection is a prime number and we return "YES".

This approach ensures that we only need to check up to the square root of the length of the intersection and hence reduces the time complexity.

Note: The given intervals are assumed to be valid, i.e., the
