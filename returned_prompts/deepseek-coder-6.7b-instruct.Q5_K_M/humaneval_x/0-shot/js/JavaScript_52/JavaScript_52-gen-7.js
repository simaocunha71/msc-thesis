//.every() method tests whether all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function.
//If it finds an array element where the function returns false, it returns false and stops iterating over the array. 
//If it doesn't find an array element where the function returns false, it returns true.

/*
The function belowThreshold takes in two parameters, l (a list of numbers) and t (a threshold).
It uses the array method .every() to test if every number in the list is below the threshold.
If all numbers are below the threshold, the function returns true, otherwise it returns false.
*/

//This function can be used to check if all numbers in a list are below a certain threshold.
//This can be useful in many applications such as checking if all temperatures in a list are below a certain threshold for a weather app.

//The function is case sensitive and will only return true if all numbers in the list are strictly below the threshold. 
//If you want to include numbers equal to the threshold, you would need to adjust the function accordingly.
