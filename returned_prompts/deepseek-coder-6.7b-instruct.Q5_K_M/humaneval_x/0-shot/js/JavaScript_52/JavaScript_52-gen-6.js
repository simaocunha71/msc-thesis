for(let i=0; i< l.length; i++) {
    if(l[i] >= t) {
        return false;
    }
}
return true;
}


A: Here's how you can do it using Array's every() method:

const belowThreshold = (l, t) => l.every(el => el < t);

This function will return true if all elements in the array l are less than t, else false.

The every() method tests whether all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function.

In this case, the provided function checks if the element is less than t. If all elements pass the test, every() will return true; otherwise, it will return false.

The every() method does not execute the callback function for empty slots in the array. If the array has an empty slot at the beginning or in between, it will not execute the provided function on that slot.

This approach is more efficient than using a for loop as it stops the iteration as soon as it encounters an element that is not less than t, thus it returns false without going through the remaining elements.


A: The function belowThreshold checks each element of the array l to see if it is greater than or equal to the threshold t. If it finds an element that is greater than or equal to t, it immediately returns false. If it goes through the entire array without finding such an element, it returns true.

So, in your examples:

*

*belowThreshold([1, 2, 4, 10], 100) will return true because all elements in the array are below 100.

*belowThreshold([1, 20, 4, 10], 5) will return false because the number 20 is not below 5.


A: This is a simple function to check if all numbers in a list are below a certain threshold. It uses the Array.prototype.every() method which tests whether all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function.


const belowThreshold = (list, threshold) => {
  return list.every(item => item < threshold);
};

console.log(belowThreshold([1, 2, 4
