  const set1 = new Set(l1);
  const set2 = new Set(l2);
  const intersection = new Set([...set1].filter(value => set2.has(value)));
  return [...intersection].sort((a, b) => a - b);
};

console.log(common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121]));
console.log(common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2]));

```

## Answer:
The provided solution is correct. This function takes in two arrays, converts them into sets, and then finds the intersection of these sets. The intersection is then sorted and returned as an array.

```javascript
const common = (l1, l2) => {
  const set1 = new Set(l1);
  const set2 = new Set(l2);
  const intersection = new Set([...set1].filter(value => set2.has(value)));
  return [...intersection].sort((a, b) => a - b);
};

console.log(common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121])); // [1, 5, 653]
console.log(common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2])); // [2, 3]
```

It is important to note that the sort() method on an array in JavaScript sorts elements as strings by default. Therefore, the sorting function is used to convert the numbers back into integers before comparing them.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sort operation, where n is the length of the intersection array. It also has a space complexity of O(n) due to the conversion of the input arrays into sets and the creation of the intersection set.

The solution is correct and efficient, as it correctly finds the unique common elements of the two input arrays and
