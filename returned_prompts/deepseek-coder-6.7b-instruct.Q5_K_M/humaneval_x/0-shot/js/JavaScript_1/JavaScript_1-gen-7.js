let stack = [];
let group = [];
let result = [];

for(let char of paren_string.replace(/\s/g, "")){
    if(char === '('){
        stack.push(char);
        group.push(char);
    }
    if(char === ')'){
        stack.pop();
        group.push(char);
        if(stack.length === 0){
            result.push(group.join(""));
            group = [];
        }
    }
}
return result;

console.log(separateParenGroups('(  )  (( ))  (( )( ))'));  // ['()', '(())', '(()())']

This code works by iterating through the string and pushing each open parenthesis onto the stack and to the group array. When it encounters a closed parenthesis, it pops the last item off of the stack and adds it to the group array. If the stack is empty, it means that the group is complete and it adds the group to the results array and resets the group array.

A: This problem is about parsing string with nested parentheses. You can solve it by using a stack.

*

*Initialize an empty stack and an empty result list.

*Iterate over each character in the string.

*If the character is an open parenthesis, push it to the stack and start a new group.

*If the character is a close parenthesis, pop the last element from the stack and add it to the current group.

*When the stack is empty, this means that the current group is complete. Add it to the result list and start a new group.

*Return the result list.

In your problem, you need to ignore spaces in the input string. You can do this by using the replace method with a regular expression to remove all spaces.

Here is a Python solution:

```python
def separateParenGroups(s):
    stack = []
    group = []
    result = []

    for char in s.replace(" ", ""):
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(char)
            group.append(char)
        if char == ')':
            stack.pop
