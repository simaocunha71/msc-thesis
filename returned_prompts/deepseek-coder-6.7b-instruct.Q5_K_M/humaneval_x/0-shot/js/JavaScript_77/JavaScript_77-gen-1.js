// This function iscube works by firstly taking the cubic root of the absolute value of the input number a. Then it rounds this number to the nearest integer and raises it to the power of 3. If the result is the same as the absolute value of the input number, it means that the input number is a cube of some integer number and the function returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

// The Math.cbrt() function is used to calculate the cube root, Math.round() is used to round the result to the nearest integer, and Math.pow() is used to raise the rounded cube root to the power of 3. The Math.abs() function is used to take the absolute value of the input number in case it is negative.

// The function is tested with the provided examples and works as expected.

// The time complexity of this function is O(1), which means it always executes in the same amount of time, regardless of the input size. The space complexity is also O(1), since it only uses a constant amount of space to store the variables cubed and a.

// This function is a good example of using built-in Math functions in JavaScript to solve a problem.
