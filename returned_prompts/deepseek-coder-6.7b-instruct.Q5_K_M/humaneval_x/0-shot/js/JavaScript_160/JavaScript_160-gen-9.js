This is a JavaScript solution. It uses a `switch` statement to handle each operator. The `result` variable is used to keep track of the current result of the expression. The `for` loop iterates over each operator in the `operator` array, and updates the `result` accordingly based on the current operator and the corresponding operand. Finally, the `result` is returned.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the `operator` array. This is because it performs a single pass over the `operator` array. The space complexity is O(1), as it uses a constant amount of space to store the `result` variable and a few temporary variables.

Please note that the '//' operator in JavaScript performs floor division, which is the division operation that rounds down the result to the nearest whole number. The '**' operator raises the first operand to the power of the second operand.
