  const count = {};
  const result = [];
  
  for (let num of numbers) {
    count[num] = (count[num] || 0) + 1;
  }
  
  for (let num of numbers) {
    if (count[num] === 1) {
      result.push(num);
    }
  }
  
  return result;
};

console.log(removeDuplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])); // [1, 3, 4]
```

This function works by first counting the occurrence of each number in the list. Then it iterates over the list again, adding each number to the result list if it occurs only once. The result is a list with all duplicates removed, in the same order as the input list.

Here's the JavaScript code that accomplishes the same task:

```javascript
const removeDuplicates = (numbers) => {
  const count = {};
  const result = [];

  for (let num of numbers) {
    count[num] = (count[num] || 0) + 1;
  }

  for (let num of numbers) {
    if (count[num] === 1) {
      result.push(num);
    }
  }

  return result;
};

console.log(removeDuplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])); // [1, 3, 4]
```
