The function works by using the indexOf() method to search for the substring in the string. If the substring is found, it increments a count and continues the search from the next position. This continues until indexOf() returns -1, which indicates that the substring is not found. The function then returns the count.

It's worth noting that this function counts overlapping occurrences. For example, in the string 'aaaa', the substring 'aa' occurs three times, because 'aa' is found at the start of the string, followed by another 'aa' at the end, and there is another 'aa' in the middle.
