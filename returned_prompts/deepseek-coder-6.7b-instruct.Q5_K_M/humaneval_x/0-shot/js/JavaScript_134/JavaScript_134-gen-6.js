This function uses a regular expression to check if the last character of the string is a letter. The `$` symbol is used to match the end of the string, and `i` is used to ignore the case of the letter. If the last character is a letter and the character before it is a space, the function returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.

This function assumes that a "word" is defined as a group of characters separated by a space. Therefore, it checks if the character before the last character is a space.

Please note that this function does not handle punctuation, like periods, commas, or exclamation marks. If you want to consider these as part of the word, you would need to modify the function to handle these cases.

Also, this function assumes that the input string is properly formatted. If there are leading or trailing spaces, this function will not work correctly. If you want to handle these cases, you would need to modify the function to remove these spaces.

This function works in JavaScript. If you are using a different programming language, you would need to adjust the syntax accordingly.
