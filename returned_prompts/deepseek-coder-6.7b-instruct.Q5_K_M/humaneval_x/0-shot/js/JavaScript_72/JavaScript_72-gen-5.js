The function willItFly takes in an array q and a number w. It first calculates the sum of all elements in the array q using the reduce method. Then it checks if the array q is balanced by comparing the original array q with the reversed array q. If they are equal, the array is balanced. Finally, it checks if the sum is less than or equal to w and if the array is balanced. If both conditions are true, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

// Notes: 
// The reduce method is used to calculate the sum of all elements in the array.
// The join method is used to convert the array to a string and compare it with the reversed string.
// The sum <= w && isBalanced condition checks if the sum of the elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight and if the object is balanced.
// The function will return true if both conditions are true, and false otherwise.

// Tests:
// willItFly([1, 2], 5) should return false
// willItFly([3, 2, 3], 1) should return false
// willItFly([3, 2, 3], 9) should return true
// willItFly([3], 5) should return true

// This function works correctly based on the problem's requirements.

// Time complexity: O(n) because of the reduce and join methods.
// Space complexity: O(n) because of the slice and reverse methods.

// The overall time complexity is O(n) and space complexity is O(n).

// The function willItFly is implemented in JavaScript
