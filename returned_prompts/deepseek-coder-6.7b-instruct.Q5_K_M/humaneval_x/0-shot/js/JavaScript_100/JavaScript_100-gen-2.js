// 1. Define a function makeAPile that accepts an integer n
// 2. Initialize an empty array result to hold the number of stones at each level
// 3. Set nextNumber to n
// 4. Start a loop that runs n times
// 5. In each iteration of the loop:
//   a. Push nextNumber into result
//   b. If nextNumber is even, add 2 to it and assign it to nextNumber
//   c. If nextNumber is odd, add 2 to it and assign it to nextNumber
// 6. After the loop, return result

// This function makes a pile of n levels of stones where the number of stones in each level is either the next even or odd number.
// It returns the number of stones at each level in the form of an array.

// Example:
// makeAPile(3) returns [3, 5, 7]
// The first level has 3 stones, the second level has 5 stones, and the third level has 7 stones.
// The number of stones in the next level is the next even number if the current level number is even, and the next odd number if the current level number is odd.


// This is a simple implementation of the problem and works fine for small inputs.
// However, for larger inputs, we may need to consider performance optimizations.
// For example, we can use a generator function to yield the numbers instead of storing them in an array.
// This would be more memory efficient for large inputs as we don't need to store all the numbers at once.
// We can also use bitwise operations to determine the next number, which would be faster.
// But these optimizations are beyond the scope of the current problem.
