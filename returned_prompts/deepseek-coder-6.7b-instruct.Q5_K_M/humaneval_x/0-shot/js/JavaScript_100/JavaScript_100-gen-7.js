console.log(makeAPile(3));

The function makeAPile() takes an integer n as an argument and initializes an empty array arr. The function then enters a for loop that will run n times. The loop will run until the end of the array arr is reached.

Inside the for loop, the function checks if n is an even number. If it is, then the function pushes the next even number to the array arr. If n is not an even number (i.e., it is odd), then the function pushes the next odd number to the array arr.

After the loop has finished running, the function returns the array arr. 

The function will return an array of the number of stones in each level of the pile of stones, where the number of stones in the first level is n, the number of stones in the second level is the next odd number if n is odd, or the next even number if n is even, and so on.
