let sortedNumbers = numbers.sort((a, b) => a - b);

for (let i = 0; i < sortedNumbers.length - 1; i++) {
  if (sortedNumbers[i+1] - sortedNumbers[i] < threshold) {
    return true;
  }
}

return false;

}

module.exports = hasCloseElements;
```

This function first sorts the list of numbers in ascending order. Then it loops through the sorted list and checks if the difference between any two consecutive numbers is less than the given threshold. If it finds such a pair, it immediately returns true. If it doesn't find any such pair after checking all the elements, it returns false.

The time complexity of this function is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, and the space complexity is O(n) due to the sortedNumbers array.

Here is the test code:

```javascript
console.log(hasCloseElements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)); // false
console.log(hasCloseElements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)); // true
```

This code should print "false" and "true" to the console, as expected.

Please note that the sort function used here is a built-in JavaScript function. It uses a sorting algorithm called Timsort, which has a worst-case time complexity of O(n log n).

Also, the sort function is not in place, so it creates a new array and does not modify the original array. This is why we store the sorted numbers in the sortedNumbers variable. If you want to sort the original array in place, you can use the sort method with no arguments like this: numbers.sort().

Lastly, this function assumes that the numbers array does not contain any non-number values. If you want to handle non-number values, you can add a check for this before sorting.

```javascript
if (numbers.some(isNaN)) {
  throw new Error('Invalid input: must be a list of numbers');
}
```

This will throw an error
