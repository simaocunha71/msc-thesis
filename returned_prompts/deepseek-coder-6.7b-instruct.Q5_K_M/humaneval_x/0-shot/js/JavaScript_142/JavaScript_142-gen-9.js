  This function seems to be implemented correctly. It checks for each index in the list whether it is a multiple of 3 or 4. If the index is a multiple of 3 but not 4, it squares the number at that index. If the index is a multiple of 4, it cubes the number at that index. If the index is neither a multiple of 3 nor 4, it just adds the number at that index to the sum. In the end, it returns the sum of all numbers in the list.
  
  The function passes the examples you provided, so it seems to work correctly.
