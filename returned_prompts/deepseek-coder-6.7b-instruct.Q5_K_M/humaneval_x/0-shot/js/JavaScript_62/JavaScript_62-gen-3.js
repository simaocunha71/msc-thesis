  return xs.slice(1).map((x, i) => x * (i + 1));
};

console.log(derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])); // [1, 4, 12, 20]
console.log(derivative([1, 2, 3])); // [2, 6]
```

The function `derivative` takes an array of coefficients `xs`. It slices off the first coefficient (which is always 0, so the derivative will not include it), then multiplies each remaining coefficient by its index (plus one) and returns the new array. The multiplication by the index accounts for the power rule of differentiation.

This solution uses the JavaScript `map` function to apply the derivative operation to each coefficient in the array. The `slice` function is used to remove the first coefficient from the array, and the `map` function is used to apply the derivative operation to each remaining coefficient. The `map` function also takes an index as a second argument, which is used to keep track of the power of `x` for each coefficient.

The solution also works for polynomials of any degree, as long as the coefficients are provided in the order of increasing degree.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the degree of the polynomial. This is because we have to iterate over each coefficient once to apply the derivative operation. The space complexity is also O(n), as we create a new array of coefficients to hold the derivative.

This solution assumes that the input will always be a valid polynomial represented as an array of coefficients. If this is not the case, additional error checking may be needed.

Lastly, this solution uses JavaScript's array methods and features, so it can be used in any JavaScript environment.


### Python

```python
def derivative(xs):
    return [i * xs[i] for i in range(1, len(xs))]

print(derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5]))  # [1, 4, 12, 20]
print(derivative([1, 2, 3]))  # [2, 6]
```

This Python function uses a list comprehension
