// Here is the JavaScript solution for the problem

function sortStringsByLengthAndAlphabetically(arr) {
    // filtering out the strings with odd length
    let newArr = arr.filter(word => word.length % 2 === 0);
    // sorting the array by length and then alphabetically
    newArr.sort((a, b) => a.length - b.length || a.localeCompare(b));
    return newArr;
}

console.log(sortStringsByLengthAndAlphabetically(["aa", "a", "aaa"])); // ["aa"]
console.log(sortStringsByLengthAndAlphabetically(["ab", "a", "aaa", "cd"])); // ["ab", "cd"]


The function `sortStringsByLengthAndAlphabetically` filters out the strings with odd length and then it sorts the array by length and then alphabetically. The `sort` method in JavaScript can take a comparator function which determines the sort order. In this case, we first compare by length (`a.length - b.length`), and if they are equal, we then compare alphabetically (`a.localeCompare(b)`).

This function uses the `filter` method to create a new array with only the strings of even length, and then uses the `sort` method to sort that array. The `sort` method returns the array sorted according to the provided comparator function.

The `localeCompare` method is a built-in method in JavaScript that returns a number indicating whether a reference string comes before, or after, or is the same as the given string in sort order.

The `filter` method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. The `sort` method sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the array. The default sort order is built upon converting the elements into strings, then comparing their sequences of UTF-16 code unit values.

The `sort` function used here will sort the array in ascending order by string length and then sorting the array alphabetically if the string lengths are equal.
