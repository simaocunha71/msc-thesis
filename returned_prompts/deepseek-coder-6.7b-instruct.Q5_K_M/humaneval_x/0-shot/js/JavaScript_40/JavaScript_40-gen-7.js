The problem is to find three numbers in the list that add up to zero. It can be solved by using a two-pointer technique. We first sort the list, then for each number, we use two pointers to find the other two numbers that sum up to the negative of the current number.

In the code, we start by sorting the list. Then we iterate over the list with a for loop. For each number, we use two pointers, one at the next number after the current number (left), and one at the last number in the list (right). If the sum of the current number and the numbers at the left and right pointers is less than zero, we move the left pointer to the right. If the sum is greater than zero, we move the right pointer to the left. If we find three numbers that sum to zero, we return true. If we finish the loop without finding three numbers that sum to zero, we return false.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the length of the list. The space complexity is O(1), because we only use a constant amount of space.
