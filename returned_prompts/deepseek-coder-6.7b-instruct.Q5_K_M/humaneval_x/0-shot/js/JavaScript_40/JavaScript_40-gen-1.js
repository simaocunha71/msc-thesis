```
This solution works by sorting the input array first, then using a pair of pointers to iterate through the array. The outer loop iterates through the array, and the inner loop uses the two pointers to find the triplet that sums to zero.

The time complexity is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input array. This is because in the worst case, we need to iterate through the array twice, once for the outer loop and once for the inner loop. The space complexity is O(1), because we are using a constant amount of space.

## Code Explanation:

This code implements a function that checks if there are three distinct numbers in a given array that sum to zero.

The function `triplesSumToZero` takes a list of integers as input and returns a boolean value. It first sorts the input list in ascending order. Then it iterates over the list with a for loop. For each element at index i, it uses two pointers (`left` and `right`) to find a pair of elements that sum to the negation of the value at index i.

If it finds such a pair, it returns `true`. If it iterates over the entire list without finding such a triplet, it returns `false`.

The two pointers technique is used to efficiently search for the pair. The `left` pointer is initialized to the element immediately after `i`, and the `right` pointer is initialized
