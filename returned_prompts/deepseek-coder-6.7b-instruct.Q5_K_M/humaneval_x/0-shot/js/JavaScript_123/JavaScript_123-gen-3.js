This solution works by constructing the Collatz sequence starting from the given integer `n` and then filtering out the even numbers to obtain the odd numbers in the sequence. It then sorts the resulting list in ascending order before returning it.

This code will work for any positive integer input and will return the sorted list of odd numbers in the Collatz sequence.

The Collatz conjecture is an unsolved mathematical problem that is still a topic of research in mathematics.

The function `getOddCollatz` will return the sorted list of odd numbers in the Collatz sequence for the given input `n`.

This code is written in JavaScript and can be run in any JavaScript environment.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the starting number of the Collatz sequence. This is because we are iterating over the Collatz sequence until we reach 1. The space complexity is also O(n) because we are storing the numbers in the Collatz sequence.

This function will return an empty array if the input `n` is less than or equal to 0.
