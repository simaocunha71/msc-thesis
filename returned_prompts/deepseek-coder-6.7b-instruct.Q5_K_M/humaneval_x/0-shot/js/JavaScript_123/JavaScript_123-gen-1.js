  let collatz = [n];
  while (n != 1) {
    n = n % 2 == 0 ? n / 2 : 3 * n + 1;
    if (n % 2 != 0) collatz.push(n);
  }
  return collatz.sort((a, b) => a - b);
}
```

## Solution: 

```javascript
const getOddCollatz = (n) => {
  let collatz = [n];
  while (n != 1) {
    n = n % 2 == 0 ? n / 2 : 3 * n + 1;
    if (n % 2 != 0) collatz.push(n);
  }
  return collatz.sort((a, b) => a - b);
}
```

## Explanation: 

This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a sorted list of odd numbers in its Collatz sequence.

It starts by creating an array `collatz` with `n` as its first element. Then it enters a loop that continues until `n` is equal to 1.

Inside the loop, it first checks if `n` is even. If it is, `n` is updated to be half of its current value. If `n` is odd, it is updated to be 3 times its current value plus 1.

After updating `n`, the function checks if `n` is now odd. If it is, `n` is added to the end of `collatz`.

Finally, the function returns `collatz` sorted in ascending order.

This function follows the Collatz conjecture, which states that for any positive integer `n`, the sequence will eventually reach 1, regardless of the starting number.

The reason this works is that the Collatz conjecture is a mathematical conjecture, and as such, its correctness can't be proven or disproven. It's just a conjecture that's been observed to hold true for many different starting values of `n`.

To note, this function doesn't actually prove the Collatz conjecture. It merely follows its rules and returns a list of the observed odd numbers in a sequence.
