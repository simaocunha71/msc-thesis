console.log(getOddCollatz(5)); // [1, 5]

console.log(getOddCollatz(27)); // [1, 27, 82, 41]
console.log(getOddCollatz(8191)); // [1, 8191]

// Note: The complexity of this solution is O(n), as we need to iterate through all the numbers in the Collatz sequence.
// Also, we are storing the numbers in an array, which also takes up space.
// The space complexity is also O(n), as in the worst case scenario, we will store all numbers in the Collatz sequence.
```

**Explanation:**

In this solution we use a while loop to generate the Collatz sequence until we reach 1. If the current number is odd, we add it to the `collatz` array. After the loop ends, we add 1 to the `collatz` array, as per the Collatz conjecture, and then sort the array in increasing order before returning it.

This solution should work for all positive integers as per the problem statement.

**Complexity Analysis:**

Time Complexity: O(n) - We need to iterate through all the numbers in the Collatz sequence.

Space Complexity: O(n) - We are storing all numbers in the Collatz sequence in an array.

This solution should be efficient for most inputs.
