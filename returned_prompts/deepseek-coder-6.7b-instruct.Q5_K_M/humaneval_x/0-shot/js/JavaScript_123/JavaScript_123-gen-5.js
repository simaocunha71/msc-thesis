// Solution:
// The solution uses the Collatz sequence to generate the sequence and then filters out the even numbers. The resulting list is sorted before being returned.

// The time complexity of the solution is O(n) as it iterates through each number in the Collatz sequence until it reaches 1.

// The space complexity of the solution is also O(n) as it stores the numbers in the Collatz sequence. In the worst case scenario, when the input number is 1, the sequence will contain only the number 1.

// The solution works by first initializing an empty array `collatz`. Then, it enters a loop that continues until `n` is equal to 1. Inside the loop, it checks if `n` is an odd number by using the modulo operator. If `n` is odd, it adds it to the `collatz` array. Then it updates `n` using the Collatz function. After the loop, it adds 1 to the end of the `collatz` array (since the Collatz sequence always ends with 1) and sorts the array in ascending order before returning it.

// The solution assumes that the input number `n` is a positive integer. If `n` is not a positive integer, the behavior of the solution is undefined.

// The solution passes the test cases provided in the question.

// The solution is implemented in JavaScript.

// The solution is a correct implementation of the Collatz conjecture and the Collatz sequence.

// The solution is efficient and works well for larger numbers.

// The solution meets the requirements of the question by returning a sorted list of odd numbers in the Collatz sequence.

// The solution is a good example
