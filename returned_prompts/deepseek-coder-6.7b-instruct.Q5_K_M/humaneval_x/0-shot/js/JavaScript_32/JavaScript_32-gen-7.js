A: The problem with your code lies in the fact that you're trying to find a root of a polynomial using Newton's method, which is not guaranteed to converge for all functions. 

Newton's method is a root-finding algorithm that uses linear approximation to find successively better approximations to the roots of a real-valued function.

However, in your case, the function you're trying to find a root of, isn't guaranteed to converge. This is due to the fact that the largest coefficient is 11, and the polynomial is a square, which means it has at most one real root. However, the root may be complex.

The function f(x) = -6 + x*(11 - 6x + x^2) = x^2 - 2x + 11 is a quadratic with no real roots, but it's not a problem for your code, because Newton's method will still converge.

If you want to find the real roots of the polynomial, you should use a different method, like the Durand-Kerner method, which is guaranteed to converge for polynomials with no repeated roots.

Here's a corrected version of your code using the Durand-Kerner method:

```javascript
const poly = (xs, x) => {
  return xs.reduce((prev, item, index) => {
    return prev + item * Math.pow(x, index);
  }, 0);
}

const findZero = (xs) => {
  const f = (x) => poly(xs, x);

  let x = 0.0;
  while (Math.abs(f(x)) > 1e-6) {
    x = x - f(x) / (poly
