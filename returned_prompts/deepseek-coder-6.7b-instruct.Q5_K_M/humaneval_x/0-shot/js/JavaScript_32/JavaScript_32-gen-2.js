In this script, we use the bisection method to find the root of the polynomial. The bisection method is a root-finding method that applies to any continuous functions for which one knows two values with opposite signs. This method is named after the Greek mathematician Diofant of Alexandria, who named it after him.

Here, the coefficients of the polynomial are taken as inputs and we try to find the value of x which makes the polynomial equal to zero. We start by initializing two values a and b such that the function takes opposite signs at a and b. Then we calculate the midpoint of the interval [a, b] and check the sign of the function at this point. If the sign is the same as a, then we replace a with the midpoint, otherwise we replace b with the midpoint. We repeat this process until the interval [a, b] becomes smaller than a small positive number, say 0.00001. The midpoint of the final interval is then our approximation for the root of the function.

The bisection method is guaranteed to converge to a root of the function, provided that the function changes sign at a and b.

This method is suitable for polynomials of degree less than or equal to 20. For higher degree polynomials, other methods like Newton-Raphson method or secant method can be used.

In the code, we have used the reduce function to sum up the coefficients multiplied by x raised to the power of their index.

This script will return the root of the polynomial, even if there are many roots. However, it will return only one root. If you want to find all roots of a polynomial, you will need to use a different method, such as the Durand-
