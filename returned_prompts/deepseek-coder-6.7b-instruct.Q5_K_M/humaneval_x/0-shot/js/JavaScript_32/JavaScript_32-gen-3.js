The task is to find the root of the polynomial equation. The Newton's method is used here, which is a root-finding algorithm that produces successively better approximations to the roots of a real-valued function.

The function `poly` evaluates the polynomial with coefficients `xs` at point `x`.

The function `findZero` finds the zero of the polynomial with coefficients `xs`.

The function `df` is the derivative of the function `f`.

The function `newton` is the Newton's method. It iteratively improves the guess of the root of the function `f`.

The result is the zero of the polynomial.

The Newton's method is guaranteed to converge to a root if it exists and is convergent if the initial guess is close enough to the root.

The Newton's method is used here because it is simple and efficient. It uses the derivative of the function to find the zero of the function, which is a necessary condition for the function to have a zero.

The Newton's method is based on the Taylor series expansion of the function around the current guess. The Taylor series expansion of the function is used to approximate the function near the current guess. The approximation is used to find the next guess.

The initial guess is set to 0. The function `newton` is called iteratively with the current guess as the argument, until the change in the guess is less than a small threshold (here, 0.00001). The final guess is the zero of the polynomial.
