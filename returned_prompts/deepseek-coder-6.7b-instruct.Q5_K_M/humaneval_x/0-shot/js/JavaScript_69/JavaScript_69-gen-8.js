// The problem is solved using the frequency count pattern. We start by creating a counts object. We iterate over the input list and for each integer, we increase its count in the counts object. After that, we iterate from 1 to the length of the input list and for each i, we check if the count of i exists in the counts object and if it is greater or equal to i. If it is, we return i. If no such i exists, we return -1.

// This solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list.

// Please note that this solution assumes that the input list contains only positive integers. If the input list can contain other values, you may need to add checks to handle those cases.

// Also note that the problem statement seems a bit ambiguous. In the example, the number 3 appears 3 times but it is not greater than 3, so it does not meet the requirements. I have assumed that the frequency count should be greater or equal to the integer itself. If this is not the case, the solution will need to be adjusted accordingly.

// This solution works for the examples provided and should work for other inputs as well.
