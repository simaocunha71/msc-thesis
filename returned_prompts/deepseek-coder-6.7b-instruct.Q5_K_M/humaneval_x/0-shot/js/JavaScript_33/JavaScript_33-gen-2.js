A: Here is the Python solution for your question.

```python
def sortThird(l):
    third_elements_indices = range(2, len(l), 3)
    third_elements_values = sorted([l[i] for i in third_elements_indices])

    for i, v in zip(third_elements_indices, third_elements_values):
        l[i] = v

    return l

print(sortThird([1, 2, 3]))
print(sortThird([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))
```

In this solution, we first identify the indices of elements that should be sorted, i.e., those that are a multiple of 3. We then sort these values and replace the corresponding elements in the original list.

Please note that in Python, list indices start at 0. So, the third element (at index 2) is the first one that should be sorted.

This solution assumes that the input list `l` has at least 3 elements. If it might have less, you should add a check for this before trying to access the third element.
```python
if len(l) >= 3:
    third_elements_indices = range(2, len(l), 3)
    third_elements_values = sorted([l[i] for i in third_elements_indices])

    for i, v in zip(third_elements_indices, third_elements_values):
        l[i] = v

    return l
else:
    return l  # or return an error message, etc.
```

This code can be run in any Python environment. The output will be as
