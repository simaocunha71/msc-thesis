This function works by iterating over the original list and checking if the current index is divisible by three. If it is, it replaces the current element of the new list with the corresponding element of the original list, but sorted in ascending order.

The filter method is used to create a new array of elements that are at indices divisible by three. The sort method is then used to sort this new array in ascending order. The sorted array is then sliced to the correct length and the first element is selected, which is the nth element of the original array where n is the index of the current element in the new array. This is achieved by using bitwise OR (|) to round down the index to an integer.

Finally, the function returns the new list.

The time complexity of this function is O(n log n) because of the sort operation. The space complexity is O(n) because of the creation of a new array.

This function assumes that the input list only contains numbers. If the input list contains non-number elements, the function may not work as expected.

This function also assumes that the indices of the list start at 0. If the indices start at a different value, the function may not work as expected.

In conclusion, this function meets the problem requirements and is efficient in terms of time and space complexity.
