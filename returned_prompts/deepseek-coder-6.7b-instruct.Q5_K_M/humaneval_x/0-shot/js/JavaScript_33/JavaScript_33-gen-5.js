Explanation:

The function `sortThird` takes a list `l` and returns a list `l'` such that `l'` is identical to `l` in the indices that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal to the values of the corresponding indices of `l`, but sorted.

First, it creates a new array `indicesDivByThree` that contains the values of the indices that are divisible by three (`i % 3 === 0`). This array is sorted in ascending order.

Then, it maps over the original array `l` and for each index `i`, if `i` is divisible by three, it replaces the value at that index with the next element from the sorted `indicesDivByThree` array (`indicesDivByThree.shift()`), otherwise it keeps the original value (`n`).

Finally, it returns the modified array.

This function works by using the `filter` and `sort` array methods to create a new array of the indices that are divisible by three, and the `map` array method to replace the values at these indices with the sorted values from the `indicesDivByThree` array.

The `shift` method is used to remove and return the first element from the `indicesDivByThree` array, which is then used as the replacement for the corresponding value in the original array.

This function preserves the values at the non-divisible-by-three indices of the original array, and replaces the values at the divisible-by-three indices with the sorted values
