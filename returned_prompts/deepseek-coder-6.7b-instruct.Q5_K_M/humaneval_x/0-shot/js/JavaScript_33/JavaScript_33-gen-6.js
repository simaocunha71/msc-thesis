  const newArr = l.slice();
  const sortedThird = l.filter((_, i) => (i + 1) % 3 === 0).sort((a, b) => a - b);

  for (let i = 0; i < l.length; i++) {
    if ((i + 1) % 3 === 0) {
      newArr[i] = sortedThird.shift();
    }
  }

  return newArr;
};


This function works by first making a copy of the input list and then filtering out the elements at the indices that are divisible by three. The elements filtered out are sorted.

Then, the original list is traversed and the element at the index divisible by three is replaced with the first element of the sorted list. The first element of the sorted list is then removed to ensure that it is not used again.

This process is repeated until all elements at the indices divisible by three are replaced and all elements in the sorted list have been used.

At the end, the modified list is returned.



A: Here is a Python solution for the problem:

```python
def sortThird(l):
    newArr = l[:]
    sortedThird = sorted([l[i] for i in range(len(l)) if (i + 1) % 3 == 0])
    index = 0

    for i in range(len(l)):
        if (i + 1) % 3 == 0:
            newArr[i] = sortedThird[index]
            index += 1

    return newArr
```

In this solution, the function first makes a copy of the input list `l` and then filters out the elements at the indices that are divisible by three. The elements filtered out are sorted.

Then, the original list `l` is traversed and the element at the index divisible by three is replaced with the first element of the sorted list. The first element of the sorted list is then removed to ensure that it is not used again.

This process is repeated until all elements at the indices divisible by three are replaced and all elements in the sorted list have been used.

At the end, the modified list is returned.
