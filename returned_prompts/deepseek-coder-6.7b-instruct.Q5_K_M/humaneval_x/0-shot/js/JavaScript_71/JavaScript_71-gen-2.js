  if (a + b > c && a + c > b && b + c > a) {
    let s = (a + b + c) / 2;
    let area = Math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c));
    return Math.round(area * 100) / 100;
  } else {
    return -1;
  }
}

module.exports = triangleArea;
```

This function first checks if the three sides can form a valid triangle. If they can, it calculates the semi-perimeter of the triangle and then uses it to calculate the area using Heron's formula. The area is then rounded to two decimal places and returned. If the sides do not form a valid triangle, the function returns -1.

You can run this function in JavaScript environment to check it. Just pass the length of the three sides of the triangle to the function as arguments.

Here is the usage:

```javascript
console.log(triangleArea(3, 4, 5));  // Outputs: 6.00
console.log(triangleArea(1, 2, 10)); // Outputs: -1
```

This function works for any three numbers as long as they can form a valid triangle.
