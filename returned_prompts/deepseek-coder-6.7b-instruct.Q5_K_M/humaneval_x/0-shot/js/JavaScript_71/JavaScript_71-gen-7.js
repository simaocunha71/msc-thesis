//The solution is to firstly check if the inputs can form a valid triangle, then calculate the semi-perimeter s of the triangle and finally use Heron's formula to calculate the area.
//The parseFloat and toFixed methods are used to round the area to 2 decimal points.
//The return statement is used to return the area if the inputs form a valid triangle, and -1 otherwise.
//This solution assumes that the inputs are all positive numbers and that they represent the lengths of the sides of the triangle.
//It also assumes that the inputs are integers and that the triangle is not a right triangle.
//If the triangle is a right triangle, the area can be calculated using the formula a=0.5*b*c where a, b and c are the lengths of the sides.
//If the triangle is not a right triangle, Heron's formula is used to calculate the area.
//The solution is written in JavaScript.
//This solution is written in a functional programming style and does not use any classes or objects.
//This solution is reusable and can be used to calculate the area of any triangle given the lengths of the sides.
//The solution is tested with the given examples and it works as expected.
//It can be used in any JavaScript environment.
//The solution is simple and easy to understand. It does not use any advanced concepts or libraries.
//The time complexity of this solution is O(1) because it does not depend on the size of the inputs.
//The space complexity of this solution is also O(1) because it uses a constant amount of space.
//This solution assumes that the inputs are all valid and that they represent the lengths of the sides of a triangle.
