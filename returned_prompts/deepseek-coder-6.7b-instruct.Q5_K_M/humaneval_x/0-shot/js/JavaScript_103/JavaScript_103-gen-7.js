//You can test the function by calling it with the example inputs and console.logging the results.

//The function first checks if n is greater than m. If so, it returns -1.
//If n is not greater than m, it calculates the average of n and m, rounds it to the nearest integer,
//and then converts that integer to a binary string. The binary string is returned.

//The bitwise right shift operator (>>>) is used to convert the average to an unsigned 32-bit integer.
//This is necessary because the toString method on a number converts the number to a signed 32-bit integer,
//which could yield negative results if the number is negative. The unsigned right shift operator (>>>)
//ensures that the number is always treated as an unsigned 32-bit integer.

//Finally, the binary string is returned.

//This function uses JavaScript's built-in Math and Number methods to calculate the average and convert the number to a binary string.
//It also uses the bitwise right shift operator to ensure that the binary string is always a positive number.
//This function should work correctly for all valid inputs.
