  if (n > m) {
    return -1;
  }
  
  const avg = Math.round((n + m) / 2);
  
  return (avg >>> 0).toString(2);
}

console.log(roundedAvg(1, 5));  // "0b11"
console.log(roundedAvg(7, 5));  // -1
console.log(roundedAvg(10, 20));  // "0b1111"
console.log(roundedAvg(20, 33));  // "0b11010"

Explanation:
The function first checks if n is greater than m. If this is true, it immediately returns -1.
If n is not greater than m, the function calculates the average of n and m, rounded to the nearest integer.
The average is then converted to binary using the toString method with 2 as the argument.
Finally, the function returns the binary representation of the rounded average.

>>> is a bitwise operator in JavaScript that performs zero-fill right shift. It is used to convert a number to an unsigned 32-bit integer.
