// Explanation:
// The function rounds the average of the two numbers (n and m) to the nearest integer.
// The average is then converted to binary using the toString() method with 2 as the radix.
// The result is returned as a string.
// If n is greater than m, -1 is returned.

// The use of ">>>" operator in the code is to convert the result to an unsigned integer.
// This is done because JavaScript automatically converts the result of the division to a floating-point number,
// and if the result is negative, it gets converted to Infinity, which leads to a wrong result.
// The ">>>" operator performs a zero-fill right shift which ensures that the result is always a positive integer.

// The use of "(avg >>> 0)" is to ensure that the result is always a positive integer, even if the original result was negative.
// This is because JavaScript uses 32-bit integers for bitwise operations and the sign bit is ignored in these operations.
// By converting the result to an unsigned integer (by using ">>>") we ensure that the result is always a positive integer.

// The "toString(2)" method is used to convert the number to a binary string.
// The number 2 is passed as the radix to specify that the number should be converted to a binary string.
// This method returns a string that represents the specified number in binary format.

// The "Math.round()" method is used to round the result to the nearest integer.
// The "(n + m) / 2" is used to calculate the average of n
