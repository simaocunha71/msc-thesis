  let balance = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < operations.length; i++) {
    balance += operations[i];
    if (balance < 0) {
      return true;
    }
  }

  return false;
}

// Test cases
console.log(belowZero([1, 2, 3])); // false
console.log(belowZero([1, 2, -4, 5])); // true
console.log(belowZero([100, -50, -75])); // true
console.log(belowZero([100, -50, 75])); // false
console.log(belowZero([0, -100, 100])); // false
```

This solution works by iterating through each operation and adding its value to the balance. If at any point the balance is less than zero, the function immediately returns true. If no such operation is found after going through all operations, the function returns false.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) as it goes through the list of operations once, and the space complexity is O(1) as it only uses a single variable to keep track of the balance.

Note that the test cases are written in a way that they are checking the function's correctness by giving it a list of operations and expecting it to return whether the balance ever falls below zero.

This code can be run in any environment that supports JavaScript, such as a web browser console, a Node.js environment, or any JavaScript-compatible editor.

This solution assumes that the input is a list of numbers, where each number represents the amount of money in dollars that was either deposited or withdrawn from the account. The numbers can be positive (deposit) or negative (withdrawal). If the input is not a list of numbers, the function may not behave as expected.

This solution also assumes that the input list is not empty. If the list is empty, the function will return false, as there are no operations to process.

This function does not handle any kind of error checking for the input, so it may behave unexpectedly if the input is not in the expected format.

This function does not handle any kind of transaction fees or interest rates that may be charged on the
