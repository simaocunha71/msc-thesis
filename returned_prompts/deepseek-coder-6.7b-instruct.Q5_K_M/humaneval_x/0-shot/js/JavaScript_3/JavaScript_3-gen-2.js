  let balance = 0;

  for (let op of operations) {

console.log(belowZero([1, 2, 3])); // false
console.log(belowZero([1, 2, -4, 5])); // true
```

The function `belowZero` takes an array of numbers representing the deposit and withdrawal operations. It starts with a balance of 0 and adds each operation to the balance. If at any point the balance is less than 0, the function returns true. If it never goes below 0, it returns false.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the number of operations. It also has a space complexity of O(1) as it uses a constant amount of space to store the balance and the operation.

Test the code in a JavaScript environment. It should return the correct results.

const belowZero = (operations) => {
  let balance = 0;

  for (let op of operations) {
    balance += op;
    if (balance < 0) return true;
  }

  return false;
};

console.log(belowZero([1, 2, 3])); // false
console.log(belowZero([1, 2, -4, 5])); // true

// Explanation:
// For the first test case, the balance is 1, 2, and 5 respectively. It never drops below zero, so it returns false.
// For the second test case, the balance is 1, 3, 2 and -2 respectively. It drops below zero at the 3rd operation, so it returns true.

/*
This solution is a direct implementation of the problem's requirements. It iterates over the operations and updates the balance accordingly. If at any point the balance is less than 0, it immediately returns true, signifying that the balance fell below zero. If it never goes below 0, it returns false. This solution is efficient and straightforward.
