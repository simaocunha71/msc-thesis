This function works by iterating through each number in the range from y to x inclusive in reverse order. For each number, it checks if the number is even by checking if the remainder of the number divided by 2 is 0. If the number is even, the function returns the number. If the function iterates through all the numbers in the range without finding an even number, it returns -1 to indicate that there are no even numbers in the range.
