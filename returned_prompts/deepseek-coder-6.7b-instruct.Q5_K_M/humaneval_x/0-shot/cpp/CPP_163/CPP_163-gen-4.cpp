The algorithm A is correct, it swaps the values of a and b if a is greater than b, this way it ensures that a will always be less than or equal to b.

B:
The algorithm B checks each number in the range from a to b (inclusive) and checks if the number is even by using the modulus operator. If the number is even, it is added to the result vector.
