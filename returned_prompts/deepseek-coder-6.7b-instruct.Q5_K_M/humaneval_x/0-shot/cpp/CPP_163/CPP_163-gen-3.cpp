In this code, we first check if a is greater than b. If it is, we swap their values so that a is less than b. Then, we iterate from a to b, and for each number, we check if it is even by checking if the remainder of the number divided by 2 is 0. If it is, we add it to the vector even_numbers. Finally, we return the vector even_numbers.
