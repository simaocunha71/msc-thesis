This program sorts each word in the string individually by its ascii value. Then it puts each sorted word back together with the original blank spaces. It does not sort the entire string as a whole, but each word individually.

/*
Output:
The ordered version of the string is: Hello  !!!Wdlor
*/

This program works by splitting the input string into words, sorting each word, and then reassembling the string. It uses a string array to temporarily hold the words, and a string to temporarily hold the characters in each word. The words are then sorted and reassembled with the original blank spaces preserved. The final sorted string is returned.

Note that the function assumes that the input string will not contain more than 100 words. If the input string could contain more than 100 words, you would need to dynamically allocate the words array.

A: Your question seems to be a homework assignment, so I'll provide a hint and not the complete solution.

Hint:

You can solve this problem by using the sort() function from the algorithm library in C++. This function sorts the characters in a string from lowest to highest ASCII value.

Here's a simple example of how you might use the sort() function:

```cpp
#include
