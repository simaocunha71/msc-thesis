A: The code you've written seems correct, but it has a small typo in the function name. You've named your function as "solutions", but you've called it as "solution". 

This is the correct code:

```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
using namespace std;

int solution(vector<int> lst){
  int sum = 0;
  for(int i=0; i<lst.size(); i+=2){
    if(lst[i] % 2 == 1){
      sum += lst[i];
    }
  }
  return sum;
}

int main(){
  vector<int> lst = {5, 8, 7, 1};
  cout << solution(lst) << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

In this code, the function `solution` takes a vector of integers as an argument and returns the sum of all odd numbers that are in even positions. The function uses a for loop to iterate over the vector, incrementing by 2 each time to only consider elements in even positions. The if statement inside the loop checks if the current element is odd (i.e., if it has a remainder of 1 when divided by 2), and if it is, adds it to the sum. Finally, the function returns the sum. 

In the `main` function, we test this with a vector `lst` containing the numbers {5, 8, 7, 1}. The output of the program is the sum of the odd numbers in even positions, which is 12.

You can replace the `lst` vector with any other vector to test the function with different inputs.
