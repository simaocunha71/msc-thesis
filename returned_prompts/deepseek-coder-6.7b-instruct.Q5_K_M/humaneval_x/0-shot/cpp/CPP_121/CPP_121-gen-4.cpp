In the function `solutions`, we iterate over the list, but we increment the counter by 2 each time to check only the elements at even positions. If the element is odd, we add it to the sum. Finally, we return the sum.

The main function is used to test the `solutions` function with the given examples.

In the first example, the elements at even positions are 5, 7 and 3rd element is 0, so we add 5 (odd) and 7 (odd) and return the sum 12.

In the second example, all elements are the same and odd, so we add all of them and return the sum 15.

In the third example, there is no odd element at an even position, so we return 0.

This program should return 12, 15 and 0 for the examples given.
