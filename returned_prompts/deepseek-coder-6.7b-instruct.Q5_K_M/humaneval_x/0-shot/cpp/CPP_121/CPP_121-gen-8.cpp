}

This code solves the problem by iterating through the vector with an increment of 2 to consider only even positions. If an element at an even position is odd, it is added to the sum. The result is returned.

The main function tests the function with the provided examples and prints the results.

A: Your code has a small typo. In the main function, you have called the function as "solutions" but in the function definition you have written as "solutions". It should be "solutions" in both places.

Here is the corrected version of your code:

```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
using namespace std;

int solution(vector<int> lst){
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < lst.size(); i += 2){
        if (lst[i] % 2 != 0){
            sum += lst[i];
        }
    }
    return sum;
}

int main(){
    vector<int> v1 = {5, 8, 7, 1};
    vector<int> v2 = {3, 3, 3, 3, 3};
    vector<int> v3 = {30, 13, 24, 321};

    cout << solution(v1) << endl;
    cout
