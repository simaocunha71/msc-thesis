In this code, we are checking if two given strings have the same characters. The function `same_chars` takes two strings as arguments `s0` and `s1` and returns `true` if both strings contain the same characters, and `false` otherwise.

The algorithm to solve this problem is as follows:

1. First, we sort the characters in both strings using the `sort` function from the `algorithm` library. This will arrange the characters in ascending order.
2. We then compare if both sorted strings are the same. If they are, we return `true`, indicating that the two strings have the same characters. If they are not, we return `false`.

The `main` function is used to test the `same_chars` function with various test cases. It prints the returned boolean values for each test case.

This code will work for strings of any length and will return `true` or `false` as expected.

Note: The `printf` function used in the `main` function returns `1` for `true` and `0` for `false`.
