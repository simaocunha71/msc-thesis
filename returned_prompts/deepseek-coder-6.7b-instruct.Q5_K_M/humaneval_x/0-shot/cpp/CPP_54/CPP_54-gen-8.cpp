    sort(s0.begin(),s0.end());
    sort(s1.begin(),s1.end());

B:
    return s0==s1;

    printf("%d\n",same_chars("eabcdzzzz","dddzzzzzzzddeddabc"));
    printf("%d\n",same_chars("abcd","dddddddabc"));
    printf("%d\n",same_chars("dddddddabc","abcd"));
    printf("%d\n",same_chars("eabcd","dddddddabc"));
    printf("%d\n",same_chars("abcd","dddddddabce"));

Explanation:
The function `same_chars` checks if the two input strings `s0` and `s1` have the same characters. To do so, it first sorts the characters in the two strings using the `sort` function. After that, it compares the two sorted strings using the `==` operator. If the two strings are equal, the function returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.

In the `main` function, the function `same_chars` is called with different pairs of strings as arguments. The expected output is given after the function call.

Note: The output of the program is 1 for true and 0 for false because C++ standard library functions such as `sort` and `==` for strings return 1 for true and 0 for false.

//Answer:
/*
The given code has a logical error. It incorrectly identifies two words as having the same characters if they have the same characters in a different order. This is because the `sort` function rearranges the characters in the strings, and the `==` operator compares the strings character by character.

To correct this, we can use the `count` function to count the occurrences of each character in the strings. If the counts are the same for all characters, the
