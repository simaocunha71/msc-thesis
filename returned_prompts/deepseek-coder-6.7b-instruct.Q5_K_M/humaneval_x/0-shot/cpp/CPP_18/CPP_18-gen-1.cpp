}



A: The given string "aaaa" contains 3 overlapping occurrences of the substring "aa". The function "how_many_times" is counting these overlapping occurrences.

A: The function how_many_times(string str, string substring) is searching for the substring in the main string and incrementing the count each time it finds the substring. If it doesn't find the substring, it returns the count. The string::find function is used to find the substring in the main string.

int count = 0;
size_t found = str.find(substring);
while (found != string::npos){
    count++;
    found = str.find(substring, found+1);
}
return count;

In the main function, the function how_many_times is called with different strings and substrings to test the function.

printf("%d\n", how_many_times("", "a"));
