A: The given program is written in C++ and not C. 
It converts a decimal number into a binary string. It uses the modulus operator to get the remainder of the division by 2 which is either 0 or 1 (the binary digits). The result is concatenated with the existing binary string. The process is repeated with the integer division of the decimal number by 2. This continues until the decimal number is greater than 0.

The string "db" is concatenated at the beginning and end of the binary string to give the final result.

In the main function, the decimal_to_binary function is called with decimal numbers 15 and 32 as arguments. The results are printed to the standard output.

The C++ Standard Library string class is used to create, manipulate, and use strings. The to_string function is used to convert an integer into a string.

The program does not have any errors or warnings, it will run without any issues.

Here is the program in C++:

```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<string>
using namespace std;

string decimal_to_binary(int decimal){
    string binary = "";
    while(decimal > 0){
        binary = to_string(decimal % 2) + binary;
        decimal /= 2;
    }
    return "db" + binary + "db";
}

int main(){
    cout << decimal_to_binary(15) << endl;
    cout << decimal_to_binary(32) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

When you run this program, it will output:

```
db1111db
db10000
