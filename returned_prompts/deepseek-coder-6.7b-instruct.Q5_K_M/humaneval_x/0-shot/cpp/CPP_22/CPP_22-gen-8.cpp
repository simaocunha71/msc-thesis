    vector<int> ints;
    for(auto& v : values){
        if(boost::any_cast<int>(&v)){
            ints.push_back(boost::any_cast<int>(v));
        }
    }
    return ints;

int main()
{
    list_any values = {1, 2, 3, "abc", std::string(""), std::string("")};

The code uses boost::any to hold any type of data and then checks if the current data is integer. If it is, it is added to the result vector.

A: Here is a Python version of your code:
def filter_integers(values):
    return [value for value in values if type(value) == int]

values = [1, 2, 3, "abc", {}, {}]
print(filter_integers(values))

This code uses a list comprehension to create a new list that only contains the integers in the input list. It does this by iterating over each value in the input list, and if the value is an integer (as determined by the type() function), it is included in the new list.
Your code is almost identical in Python, with the syntax and data types being adapted to fit the language.

A: In Python, you can use the isinstance function to check if a value is an integer. Here is a Python function that does this:

```python
def filter_integers(values):
    return [value for value in values if isinstance(value, int)]
```

This function uses a list comprehension to create a new list that only contains the integers in the input list. It does this by iterating over each value in the input list, and if the value is an integer (as determined by the isinstance function), it is included in the new list.

You can use it like this:

```python
values = [1, 2, 3, "abc", {}, {}]
print(filter_integers(values))  # Output: [1, 2,
