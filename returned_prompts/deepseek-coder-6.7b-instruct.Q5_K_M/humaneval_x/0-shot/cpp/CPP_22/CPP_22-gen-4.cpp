The code is written in C++, so the first thing to mention is that we have to use the list from the STL library instead of python list because C++ does not support dynamic typing like python.

B:

The loop will go through each element in the list_any, which is a list of any types.

C:

The boost::any_cast function is used to attempt to cast the any type to an int. If it is successful, it will return the int value, otherwise it will throw an exception.

D:

If the cast is successful, the value is pushed back into the result vector.

E:

Finally, the function returns the result vector which contains only the integers from the original list.
