In this code, we first initialize two integer variables `count1` and `count2` to store the total number of chars in the strings of the first and second vectors respectively. 

Then we iterate over the first and second vectors and update `count1` and `count2` by adding the size of each string to `count1` and `count2` respectively.

Finally, we compare `count1` and `count2`. If `count1` is less than `count2`, we return the first vector. Otherwise, we return the second vector.

The main function simply prints the result of the `total_match` function by iterating over the result vector and printing each string.

This program will output the strings in the vector that has the total number of chars in the all strings of the vector less than the other vector. If the two vectors have the same number of chars, the program will output the first vector.

It should be noted that the question doesn't specify the behaviour when the vectors are of different sizes, so this program assumes that the total number of chars in the strings of the vectors is the only factor considered.

Also, the program uses C++11 syntax. If you're using an older compiler, you may need to adjust the code.

This program takes two vectors of strings as input and returns a vector of strings as output. The vectors are
