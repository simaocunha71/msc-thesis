This code will calculate the total number of chars in all strings of each vector and then return the one with the smaller total. If they are equal, it will return the first vector.

The code uses C++11 range-based for loop to traverse the vectors. It also uses the size() method of string to get its length. The ternary operator (?:) is used to return the correct vector based on the condition.
