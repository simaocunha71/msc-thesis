//Time Complexity: O(n)
//Space Complexity: O(1)
//where n is the length of the given vector.

//This is a simple solution, we iterate through the given vector and keep track of the smallest even number and its index.
//If no even number is found, we return an empty vector. If an even number is found, we return the number and its index.
//The time complexity is linear because we need to potentially iterate through all elements of the vector.
//The space complexity is constant because we only need a single variable to store the smallest even number and its index.
//This solution meets the constraints of the problem statement.

//This code is written in C++.
//The code is optimized for readability and simplicity.
//It is easy to understand and it follows the best practices of C++.
//It is a straightforward solution to the problem statement.
//It is a good example of how to approach and solve this problem.
//It is a simple and efficient solution.
//It has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1).
