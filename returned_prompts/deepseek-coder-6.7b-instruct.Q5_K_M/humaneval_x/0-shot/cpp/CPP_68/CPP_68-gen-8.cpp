This code finds the smallest even number and its index in a given vector. If the vector is empty or there are no even numbers, it returns an empty vector.
The time complexity is O(n) because it traverses the vector once. The space complexity is O(1) because it uses a constant amount of space to store the smallest even number and its index.

Here, n is the length of the vector.

The code is written in C++. It uses a for loop to traverse the vector and find the smallest even number and its index. If the smallest even number exists, it is added to the result vector and returned. Otherwise, an empty vector is returned.

This code is a solution for the problem.

Input: A vector representing a branch of a tree that has non-negative integer nodes.

Output: A vector containing the smallest even value and its index, or an empty vector if there are no even values or the input vector is empty.
