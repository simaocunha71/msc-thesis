This code works by keeping a count of the number of opening brackets seen so far. If it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if there is a corresponding opening bracket by checking if the count is 0. If there isn't, it returns false. If there is, it decrements the count. If it encounters any other character, it returns false. If it finishes checking all characters and the count is 0, it returns true.

Note: The code uses C++ and C++ style comments. If you're using a different language, you might need to adjust the syntax.

Also, note that this code assumes that all characters in the string are either '<' or '>' and that there are no other characters. If this is not the case, you will need to add additional error checking.

Also, the code uses the C++ standard library, which is not available in C. If you're using C, you will need to adjust the code accordingly.
