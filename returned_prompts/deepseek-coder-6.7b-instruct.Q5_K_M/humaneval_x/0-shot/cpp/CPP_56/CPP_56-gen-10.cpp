}

The function correct_bracketing checks the validity of the bracket string by counting the number of open brackets '<' and subtracting the number of closed brackets '>'. If the count ever goes negative, or if there are any unclosed brackets at the end, the function returns false.

The main function tests the function correct_bracketing with four different strings and prints out the result of each test.

A: Your function is correct in terms of logic and syntax. However, the function is not handling the cases where the string starts with a closing bracket '>'. In that case, you are decreasing the count which would make the count negative.
Also, you are not handling the cases where the string ends with an opening bracket '<'. This can also make the count negative.
You can fix this by starting the count at 1 (to account for the first '<') and checking if the count is 0 at the end. If it is not 0, then return false because there are unclosed brackets at the end.
Here's the corrected function:
bool correct_bracketing(string brackets) {
    int i, cnt = 1;
    for (i = 1; i < brackets.size(); i++) {
        if (brackets[i] == '<') {
            cnt
