A: The given C++ solution is correct. It uses a simple algorithm to track the count of '<' and '>' characters in the string. For every '<', it increments the count by 1. For every '>', it decrements the count by 1. If at any point the count goes below 0, it means there is a '>' without a corresponding '<', so the function returns false. After scanning the entire string, if the count is not 0, it means there are '<' characters without corresponding '>' characters, so the function returns false. Otherwise, it returns true.

The given C++ solution also has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because it scans the string once. The space complexity is O(1), as it uses a constant amount of space to store the count and the string characters.

The given C++ solution also has good error handling. If the input string is empty, the function will return true, as there are no brackets. If there are unbalanced brackets, the function will return false.

The function can be used in any situation where you need to check if all opening brackets have a corresponding closing bracket in a string. This could be in a programming language like C++, Python, or any other language that supports strings and loops.

The given C++ solution is a good example of how to use a stack data structure to solve this problem. In this case, we are using a stack to keep track of the opening brackets and their corresponding closing brackets. This is
