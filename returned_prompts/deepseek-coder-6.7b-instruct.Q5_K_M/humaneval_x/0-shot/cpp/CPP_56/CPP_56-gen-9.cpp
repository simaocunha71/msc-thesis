    int count = 0;

C:
    return count == 0;

int main() {
    printf("%d\n", correct_bracketing("<"));
    printf("%d\n", correct_bracketing("<>"));
    printf("%d\n", correct_bracketing("<<><>>"));
    printf("%d\n", correct_bracketing("><<>"));
    return 0;
}
```

I used the C++ programming language to solve this problem.

In block A, I initialize a count to 0 to keep track of the number of opening brackets.

In block B, I iterate through each character in the string. If the character is an opening bracket, I increment the count. If the character is a closing bracket, I decrement the count. If a closing bracket is found when the count is 0, the function returns false indicating that the bracketing is incorrect.

In block C, I return true if the count is 0, indicating that all brackets have been correctly paired. If the count is not 0, the function returns false indicating that there are unpaired brackets.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string, and a space complexity of O(1), since we only use a constant amount of space to store the count.

I hope this helps clarify the problem and my solution. Let me know if you have any questions.
