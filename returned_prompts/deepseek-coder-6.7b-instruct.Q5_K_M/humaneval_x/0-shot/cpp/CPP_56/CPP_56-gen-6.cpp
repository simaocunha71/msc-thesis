    int count = 0;  // Initialize the counter to 0.

B:
    for(char& c : brackets){  // Loop over the string.
        if(c == '<'){  // If the character is '<', increment the counter.
            count++;
        }
        else if(c == '>'){  // If the character is '>'...
            if(count == 0){  // ...and the counter is 0, return false.
                return false;
            }
            count--;  // Otherwise, decrement the counter.
        }
    }

C:
    return count == 0;  // Return whether the counter is 0.
}

This code works by counting the number of opening brackets ('<'). Whenever it encounters a closing bracket ('>'), it decrements the count. If it ever encounters a closing bracket when the count is 0, it returns false. After going through all the brackets, it returns whether the count is 0. If it is, that means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

The code can be tested in any C++ compiler by pasting it into a file with a .cpp extension and running the file.

Here is the output of the code:

A: Your code seems to be correct. It iterates over the string and maintains a count of '<'. If it encounters
