The code provided is in C++ and it is solving the given problem by using the concept of vectors and strings in C++. It takes two vectors as input. One vector 'operator' contains the basic algebra operations and the other vector 'operand' contains the integers on which these operations are performed. The function 'do_algebra' performs the operations in the order they appear in the 'operator' vector, and returns the final result. The main function is just used to test the 'do_algebra' function.

The time complexity of this program is O(n) as it iterates over the 'operator' vector once. The space complexity is O(1) as it uses a constant amount of space to store the result and the index variables.
