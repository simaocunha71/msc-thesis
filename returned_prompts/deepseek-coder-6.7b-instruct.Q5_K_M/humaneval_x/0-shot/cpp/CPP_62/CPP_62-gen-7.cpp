Note:
- This code will only work with C++.
- The vector library is included.
- The derivative function takes a vector of floats as input and returns a vector of floats.
- The main function tests the derivative function with two vectors of floats.
- The derivative function calculates the derivative of the polynomial by multiplying each coefficient by its exponent and then subtracting 1 from the exponent of each term.
- The result is then printed to the standard output.

A: Here is a Python solution:

```python
def derivative(coefficients):
    return [i*coefficients[i] for i in range(1, len(coefficients))]

coeff1 = [3, 1, 2, 4, 5]
coeff2 = [1, 2, 3]

print("Derivative of polynomial 1: ", derivative(coeff1))
print("Derivative of polynomial 2: ", derivative(coeff2))
```

In this Python solution, the derivative function takes a list of coefficients as input, and returns a new list of coefficients
