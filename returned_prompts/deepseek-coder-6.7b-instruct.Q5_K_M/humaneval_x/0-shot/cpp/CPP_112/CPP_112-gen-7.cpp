    This part of the code removes all occurrences of characters in 'c' from 's'.

B:
    This part of the code creates a reversed copy of 's'.

C:
    This part of the code checks if 's' is equal to its reversed copy. If they are equal, it means that 's' is a palindrome, so "True" is added to the result. If they aren't equal, "False" is added to the result. The result is returned as a vector of strings.

/*
Time Complexity Analysis:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) because of the usage of remove() function inside a loop.
remove() function traverses the string once and for each element in the string, it may need to shift all the following characters.
Therefore, the time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) where n is the length of the string.
*/

/*
Space Complexity Analysis:
The space complexity of this solution is O(n) because a new string is created to store the result. In
