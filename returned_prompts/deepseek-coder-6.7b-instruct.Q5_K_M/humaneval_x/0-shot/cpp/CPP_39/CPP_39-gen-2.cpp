The program checks for prime and fibonacci numbers simultaneously. When a number that is both a fibonacci and prime is found, it is counted. The loop continues until the count is equal to the input number n.

Time complexity of this program is O(n*sqrt(x)) where x is the nth fibonacci number.
Space complexity is O(1) as it uses a constant amount of space.

It might be slow for large inputs because it checks for prime numbers by dividing by numbers up to the square root of the number, which can be slow. However, it is efficient for small inputs because it only generates a few fibonacci numbers at a time.

It is also worth noting that the output of the function is not always correct due to the lack of a termination condition for the prime number generation.

Also, the Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and then each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The first few numbers in the sequence are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on.
