This code generates Fibonacci numbers and checks each number if it is a prime number. If the number is prime, the counter increases by one. The function returns the Fibonacci number that is the n-th prime number.

The complexity of the code is O(n^2), because for each Fibonacci number, we check if it is prime (which is O(n) operation). In the worst case, we do this n times.

The code doesn't consider the efficiency of prime number generation, which could be improved with better algorithms (like Sieve of Eratosthenes).

Also, the code doesn't consider the edge cases (like n<=0).

This code could be improved by using more efficient algorithms for prime number generation and by handling edge cases.

However, the code works as expected and demonstrates the basic idea of how to generate prime Fibonacci numbers.

Note: If you run this code in C++ compiler, it will not print the expected output as the C++ compiler does not support printf() function.
