// This program is a simple implementation of the problem statement. The digits function takes an integer as input,
// and it iterates through each digit of the number, checking if the digit is odd. If it is, it multiplies the
// current product by that digit. If no odd digits are found, the product remains 1 and 0 is returned.

// The main function simply calls the digits function with the example input of 235 and prints the result.

// This program should compile and run without issues on a C++ compiler.

// The time complexity of this program is O(log(n)), as it iterates through each digit of the number. The space
// complexity is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the product and digit.

// This program assumes that the input number is positive. If negative numbers are possible inputs, additional
// checks would be needed to handle them appropriately.

// This program also assumes that the input number is an integer. If floating-point numbers or other types of
// numbers are possible inputs, additional checks would be needed to handle them appropriately.

// Overall, this program is a simple and efficient solution to the problem.

// I have written this program as per C++ programming language. If you want me to write this program in some other programming language, please let me know.

// Thank you for your time.
