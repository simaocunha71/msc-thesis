    The function starts by sorting the words lexicographically. This will ensure that if there are multiple words with the same number of unique characters, the one which comes first lexicographically will be selected.

B:
    The function then initializes two variables, max_unique and max_word. max_unique will keep track of the maximum number of unique characters found so far and max_word will keep track of the word with this maximum number of unique characters.

C:
    The function then goes through each word in the vector. It calculates the number of unique characters in the word and compares it to max_unique. If the word has more unique characters than the current max_word, the function updates max_unique and max_word.

D:
    Finally, the function returns max_word. This is the word with the maximum number of unique characters.
