    // Sort the words lexicographically.
    // This way we are sure that the first word to be processed will be the word with the smallest lexicographical order.
    // If there are multiple words with maximum unique characters, we will process them in lexicographical order.

B:
    // For each word in the vector:
    // - Count the number of unique characters in the word.
    // - If the number of unique characters is greater than the maximum number of unique characters found so far, update the maximum number and the word with the maximum number of unique characters.
    // - If the number of unique characters is equal to the maximum number of unique characters found so far, and the word comes before the current word in lexicographical order, update the word with the maximum number of unique characters.
