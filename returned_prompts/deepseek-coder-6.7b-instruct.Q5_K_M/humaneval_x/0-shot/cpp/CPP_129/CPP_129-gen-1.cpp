A: 
Here is the solution in python:

```python
import heapq

dx = [-1, 0, 1, 0]
dy = [0, 1, 0, -1]

def minPath(grid, k):
    n = len(grid)
    pq = [(grid[0][0], 0, 0, [grid[0][0]])]
    visited = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]
    visited[0][0] = 1
    while pq:
        cost, x, y, path = heapq.heappop(pq)
        if len(path) == k:
            return path
        for i in range(4):
            nx, ny = x + dx[i], y + dy[i]
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and not visited[nx][ny]:
                visited[nx][ny] = 1
                new_path = path + [grid[nx][ny]]
                heapq.heappush(pq, (cost + grid[nx][ny], nx, ny, new_path))

grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
k = 3
print(minPath(grid, k))
```

This python program uses a priority queue to get the path with minimum sum. It starts from the top left corner and moves to the neighboring cells. If the length of the path equals k, it returns the path. Otherwise, it continues to move to the neighboring cells and updates the path and the sum.

Please note that the problem statement is a bit ambiguous, it seems like we are looking for a path of length k, but there is a note
