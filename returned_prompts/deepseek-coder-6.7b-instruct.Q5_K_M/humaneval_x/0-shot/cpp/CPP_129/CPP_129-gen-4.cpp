This code is a solution to the problem described above. It uses a simple simulation to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. The path is found by moving in a clockwise direction from the top left corner of the grid. The path is stored in a vector and compared with the current minimum path. If the new path is smaller, it replaces the old one. The process is repeated until all possible paths of length k have been checked. The minimum path is then returned.

The time complexity of this code is O(N^2) as it visits each cell of the grid
