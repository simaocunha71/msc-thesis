Note: This code uses the C programming language. The special_factorial function calculates the special factorial of an input number. The result is a long long integer which can hold large values.

The function takes an integer n as an argument. It initializes the result to 1. Then it starts a loop that decrements from n to 1. Inside this loop, it calculates the factorial of the current number i. The factorial is calculated by multiplying all the numbers from i down to 1. The result is then multiplied by this factorial. This process is repeated until the loop has decremented down to 1. Finally, the result is returned.

The main function is used to test the special_factorial function. It reads an integer from the standard input, calls the function with this integer as an argument, and then prints the result.

This code should work correctly for inputs up to around 20. For larger inputs, the result will be too large to be stored in a long long integer.

Test this code with different inputs to verify the results.

The time complexity of this code is O(n^2) because of the nested loops. This means that the running time of the code will increase quadratically with
