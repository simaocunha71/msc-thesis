The function special_factorial(int n) computes the special factorial of n. This is done by multiplying every number from 1 to n.

B:
To improve the efficiency of the function, we can use a loop that starts from n and decrements by 1 each iteration. This will ensure that the loop does not exceed the maximum integer value.

C:
Here is the improved
