    int i=0;
    while(str[i] != '\0'){
        i++;

A: Your implementation is correct. The function strlen calculates the length of the string by counting the characters until it reaches the null character '\0'.

The C++ function strlen would look like:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>

int main() {
    char str1[] = "Hello";
    char str2[] = "";
    
    std::cout << "The length of string str1 is: " << strlen(str1) << "\n";
    std::cout << "The length of string str2 is: " << strlen(str2) << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

The C function strlen would look like:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char str1[] = "Hello";
    char str2[] = "";
    
    printf("The length of string str1 is: %lu\n", strlen(str1));
    printf("The length of string str2 is: %lu\n", strlen(str2));

    return 0;
}
```

Both of these examples will output:

```
The length of string str1 is: 5
The length of string str2 is: 0
```

The C++ strlen function uses the <cstring> library and the C strlen function uses the <string.h> library.
Both of these functions take a pointer to the first character of the string and return the number of characters in the string.
Both of these functions stop counting characters once it has reached a null character ('\0'), which is the end of a C-style string.
Both of these examples are case sensitive.
Both of these examples are case sensitive.
Both of these examples are case sensitive.

In C++, the standard library function strlen has
