    return n*(n-1)/2;
}

int main(){
    int n;
    printf("Enter the number of cars: ");
    scanf("%d",&n);
    printf("Number of Collisions: %d\n",car_race_collision(n));
    return 0;
}
```

## Output

If you run the program and input the number of cars, it will output the number of collisions that would occur.

## Example

If you input `5`, the program will output `10`. This is because there are 5 cars moving from left to right and 5 cars moving from right to left, so in total there are 5*5=25 possible pairs of cars. However, since each car is moving in the same direction as the other car, there are only 10 collisions.

## Analysis

The function `car_race_collision` calculates the number of collisions based on the formula `n*(n-1)/2`. This is because for each car moving left to right, there are `n-1` cars moving right to left that it can collide with. Therefore, the total number of collisions is the sum of collisions for all cars.

This program is a simple simulation of a scenario where cars are moving in opposite directions and colliding. It uses the formula for calculating combinations to determine the number of collisions.

The time complexity of this program is O(1), as it only performs a fixed number of operations regardless of the input size. The space complexity is also O(1), as it uses a constant amount of space to store the input and output values.

## Limitations

This program assumes that the number of cars is a positive integer. If the number of cars is not a positive integer, the program may not behave as expected.

## Conclusion

This program demonstrates a simple simulation of a scenario where cars are moving in opposite directions and colliding. It uses the formula for calculating combinations to determine the number of collisions.
