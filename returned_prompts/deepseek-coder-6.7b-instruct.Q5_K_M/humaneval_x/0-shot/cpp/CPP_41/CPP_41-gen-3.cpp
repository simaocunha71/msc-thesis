S:
The function car_race_collision calculates the number of possible collisions by iterating through all possible pairs of cars that could collide. 

A car moving left to right will collide with all cars moving right to left, so for every car moving left to right, there are n cars moving right to left. Therefore, the total number of collisions is n*n, which is returned by the function.

The time complexity of this function is O(n^2), as it involves a nested loop that iterates through all pairs of cars. This is because there are n cars moving left to right and for each of these cars, there are n cars moving right to left.

The space complexity of this function is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the number of collisions and the loop variables.

The main function reads an integer n from the standard input, calls the car_race_collision function with n as the argument, and then prints the result.
