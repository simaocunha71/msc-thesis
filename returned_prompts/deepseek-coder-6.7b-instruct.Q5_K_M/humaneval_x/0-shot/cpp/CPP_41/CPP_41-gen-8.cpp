    return n*n;
}

int main()
{
    int n;
    printf("Enter the number of cars: ");
    scanf("%d",&n);
    printf("Number of Collisions: %d",car_race_collision(n));
    return 0;
}

In this scenario, the function "car_race_collision" will return n*n which means that for every car going right to left, there are n cars going left to right, hence, n*n cars will collide.

Here is a brief explanation of the code:

In the main function, we take an integer input from the user which represents the number of cars. We then call the function "car_race_collision" with the user input as the argument and print the returned value which represents the number of collisions.

This is a simple and effective solution to the problem.

This program is written in C++ and uses the concept of function that takes an integer as input and returns an integer which represents the number of collisions. The cars are represented by integers and are assumed to be moving in opposite directions. The function returns the square of the number of cars as there are n cars going left to right and n cars going right to left, hence n*n cars will collide.

// Now let's test the code

/*
Test Case 1:
Input: 5
Output: 25
Explanation: There are 5 cars going right to left and 5 cars going left to right.
So, the total number of collisions will be 5*5 = 25.

Test Case 2:
Input: 10
Output: 100
Explanation: There are 10 cars going right to left and 10 cars going left to right.
So, the total number of collisions will be 10*10 = 100.

Test Case 3:
Input: 1
Output: 1
Explanation: There is 1 car going right to left and 1 car going left to right.
So, the total number of collisions will be 1*1 = 1.
