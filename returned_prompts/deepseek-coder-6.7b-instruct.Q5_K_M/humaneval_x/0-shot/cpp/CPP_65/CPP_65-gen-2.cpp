    string str = to_string(x);
    int len = str.length();
    if(shift > len) {
        reverse(str.begin(),str.end());
        return str;
    }
    string res = str.substr(len-shift, shift) + str.substr(0, len-shift);
    return res;
}

int main() {
    printf("%s\n", circular_shift(12, 1).c_str());
    printf("%s\n", circular_shift(123, 2).c_str());
    return 0;
}
```

This code first converts the integer `x` into a string `str`. It then checks if `shift` is greater than the number of digits in `str`. If `shift` is greater than the number of digits, it reverses the string and returns the result.

If `shift` is not greater than the number of digits in `str`, it creates a new string `res` that is the result of a circular shift. It does this by taking a substring of `str` that is `shift` digits long and starting at the end of `str`, and appending this substring to the beginning of `str`.

Finally, it returns `res`.

The `main` function tests the `circular_shift` function with the inputs `12` and `1`, and `123` and `2`, and prints the results.

## Answer

The output of the program will be:

```
21
312
```

This is because the function `circular_shift` is correctly implementing the desired circular shift operation.

## Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the number of digits in the integer x. This is because the function uses the `substr` function, which creates new substrings of the string, which takes O(n) time. The space complexity is also O(n), because the function creates a new string to store the result.

## Note

This solution assumes that the input integer x is positive. If x can be negative, the function will need to be modified to handle this case.
