A: Your question seems to be about counting the distinct characters in a string. Here is a simple way to do it in Python:

```python
def count_distinct_characters(s):
    return len(set(s.lower()))

print(count_distinct_characters("xyzXYZ"))  # Outputs: 3
print(count_distinct_characters("Jerry"))  # Outputs: 4
```

This function works by converting the string to lowercase (so that it treats uppercase and lowercase versions of the same letter as the same character), converting it to a set (which removes duplicates), and then getting its length.

This function will count the distinct characters in a string, regardless of case. If you want to count distinct characters in a case-sensitive way, you can remove the `.lower()` call.

If you want to count distinct characters in a way that distinguishes between uppercase and lowercase versions of the same letter, you can use a different approach:

```python
def count_distinct_characters(s):
    return len({c: 1 for c in s})

print(count_distinct_characters("xyzXYZ"))  # Outputs: 3
print(count_distinct_characters("Jerry"))  # Outputs: 4
```

This function works by creating a dictionary where the keys are the characters in the string and the values are all 1.
