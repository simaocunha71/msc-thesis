// The C++ code takes a vector of integers as input and returns a vector containing the sum of all integers and the product of all integers in the input vector.
// If the input vector is empty, it returns the sum as 0 and product as 1.
// The code uses a for loop to iterate over each integer in the input vector, adding it to the sum and multiplying it with the product.
// Finally, it returns the sum and product as a vector.
// The main function tests the code with an input vector of {1, 2, 3, 4} and prints the returned vector.
// The output of the main function will be (10, 24), which is the sum and product of the numbers in the input vector.
// If the input vector were empty, the output would be (0, 1).

// The complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input vector. This is because it loops over each element in the input vector exactly once.
// The space complexity is also O(n), due to the storage of the input vector.
// This code assumes that the input vector contains only integers. If it contains other types of data, it may not work as expected.
// It uses the standard library functions of C++, so it will work on any platform that supports the C++ language.
// It is a simple and efficient solution to the problem.
// The code is well-commented to explain its purpose and operation.
// The code is also formatted correctly to adhere to the C++ coding standards and conventions.
// The code is written in C++14, which includes the range-based for loop and initializer lists.
// The code is tested
