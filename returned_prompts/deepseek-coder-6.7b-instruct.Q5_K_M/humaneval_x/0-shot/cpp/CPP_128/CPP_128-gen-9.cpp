C:

## Solution Explanation

The problem is asking us to compute the sum of magnitudes of integers in the array, multiplied by the product of all signs of each number in the array. If an integer is positive, its sign is represented as 1, if it is negative, its sign is represented as -1, and if it is zero, then we return 0 immediately. If the array is empty, we return -32768.

The solution has four parts:

A: Check if the array is empty. If it is, return -32768.

B: Initialize two variables, sum and product, to 0 and 1 respectively.

C: Loop over the array. If the number is positive, multiply the product by 1. If the number is negative, multiply the product by -1 and make the number positive. If the number is zero, return 0 immediately. Add each number to the sum.

D: Return the product of the sum and the product.

## Test Cases

```c++
#include<assert.h>
int main(){
    assert(prod_signs({1, 2, 2, -4}) == -9);
    assert(prod_signs({0, 1}) == 0);
    assert(prod_signs({}) == -32768);
    printf("All test cases passed\n");
    return 0;
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the size of the array. This is because we
