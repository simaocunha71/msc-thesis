    if (b == 0)
        return a;
    else
        return greatest_common_divisor(b, a % b);

This is an implementation of the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. 

The algorithm states that the GCD of two numbers a and b is the same as the GCD of b and a%b (the remainder when a is divided by b).

In the recursive call greatest_common_divisor(b, a % b), if b becomes 0, the function returns the other number as the GCD.

This algorithm is effective because it reduces the size of the numbers at each step by taking the remainder of the division of the larger number by the smaller number. This continues until the remainder is 0, at which point the other number is the GCD.

The base case of the recursion is when b is 0, in which case the function simply returns a, which is the GCD of the original a and b.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(log min(a, b)), where a and b are the two input numbers. This is because in each recursive call, the size of the numbers is reduced by a factor of at least 2.

The space complexity is O(1), which means that the amount of memory used by the program does not grow with the size of the input numbers. This is because the program only uses a constant amount of memory to store the input and output values, and does not use any additional data structures to store intermediate results.

Hence, this is a very efficient way to find the GCD of two numbers.

Please note: This code is written in C++ language.
