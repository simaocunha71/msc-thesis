A: The code provided uses a recursive function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number, which is not optimal for large inputs due to the number of redundant calculations involved.

Here's an iterative solution that calculates the Fibonacci number in O(n) time complexity:

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int fib(int n) {
    int a = 0, b = 1, c;
    if (n == 0)
        return a;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        c = a + b;
        a = b;
        b = c;
    }
    return b;
}

int main() {
    cout << fib(10) << endl;
    cout << fib(1) << endl;
    cout << fib(8) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this code, a and b are the last two Fibonacci numbers, and c is their sum. The loop updates a and b to the last two Fibonacci numbers and the sum, which allows the calculation of the next Fibonacci number. The function returns b, the nth Fibonacci number.

This version of the function is more efficient for large inputs than the recursive version.

Please note that this solution assumes that the input is a non-negative integer. If negative inputs or non-integer inputs are possible, additional error checking should be included.

Also, if you want to use this function in a larger program, make sure to return the result of the function rather than simply printing it. The return value can be used as needed.

Lastly, the time complexity of this function is O(n), which means that it scales linearly with
