A: The given program doesn't work as expected because it replaces elements at the indices divisible by 3 with sorted elements from the vector. However, it doesn't keep track of the original elements that were not divisible by 3. 

For example, in the array {5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2}, the elements divisible by 3 are 3, 6, 9. After sorting, they become 3, 6, 9. But in the result, all these positions are replaced by the sorted elements. But the original elements 5, 4, 8, 2 that were not divisible by 3 are lost. 

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```cpp
#include<stdio.h>
#include<vector>
#include<algorithm>
using namespace std;

vector<int> sort_third(vector<int> l){
    vector<int> v;
    for(int i = 0; i < l.size(); i++){
        if((i+1)%3 == 0)
            v.push_back(l[i]);
    }
    sort(v.begin(), v.end());
    int j
