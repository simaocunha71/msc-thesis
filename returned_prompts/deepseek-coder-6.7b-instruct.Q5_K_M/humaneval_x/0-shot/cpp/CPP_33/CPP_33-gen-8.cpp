### Answer:
The issue in the original code is that it swaps the elements at indices that are divisible by three with the elements at the indices that are divisible by 3 (i.e., i/3). This is incorrect because the elements at the indices that are divisible by three are already in the correct positions in the sorted vector.

Here is the corrected code:

```cpp
#include<stdio.h>
#include<vector>
#include<algorithm>
using namespace std;
vector<int> sort_third(vector<int> l){
    for(int i=2; i<l.size(); i+=3){
        swap(l[i], l[i-2]);
    }
    return l;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> l = {5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2};
    vector<int> sorted = sort_third(l);
    for(int i=0; i<sorted.size(); i++){
        printf("%d ", sorted[i]);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This code will correctly sort the elements at the indices that are divisible by three in the vector. It does this by swapping the elements at the indices that are divisible by three with the elements two indices before them (since the elements at the indices that are divisible by three are already in the correct positions in the sorted vector).

Note that the sort() function is not used in this code, because it sorts the entire vector, not just the elements at the indices that are div
