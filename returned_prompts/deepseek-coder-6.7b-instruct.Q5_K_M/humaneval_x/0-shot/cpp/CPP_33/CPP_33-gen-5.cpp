    sort(l.begin(), l.end());
B:
    for(int i = 2; i < l.size(); i += 3) {
        swap(l[0], l[i]);
        sort(l.begin(), l.end());
    }
C:
    return l;
}


A: The sort() function is used to sort the vector in ascending order.

B: The for loop is used to swap the elements at the indices that are divisible by 3 with the smallest element in the vector. After each swap, the sort() function is used to sort the vector again to ensure that the smallest element is still at the front of the vector.

C: Finally, the sorted vector is returned.

The time complexity of this program is O(n^2logn). This is because for each index that is divisible by 3, the program performs a sort operation which takes O(nlogn) time. This is performed n/3 times, so the total time complexity is O(n^2logn). The space complexity is O(n), as a new vector is created to store the result.

//To test the function, you can use the following main function

int main() {
    vector<int> l = {5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2};
    vector<int> result = sort_third(l);
    for(int i = 0; i < result.size(); i++) {
        printf("%d ", result[i]);
    }
    return 0;
}

This program will print the following output:

2 6 3 4 8 9 5 

which is the sorted version of the input vector.
