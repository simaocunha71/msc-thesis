//The function works by creating a new vector, temp, that contains every third element from the input vector l. This is done using a for-loop that steps 3 indices at a time. After that, temp is sorted in ascending order.

//Next, the values of the input vector l are updated. Every third element of l is replaced with the corresponding element from temp, which are sorted.

//Finally, l is returned.

//The main function tests the sort_third function with the vector {5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2} and prints the result.

//The output of the main function will be: 2 6 3 4 8 9 5

//This means that every third element of the original vector was replaced with a sorted value from the original vector, as per the requirements of the function.

//The time complexity of the function is O(n log n), where n is the size of the input vector. This is because the sort function has a time complexity of O(n log n). The space complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the size of the input vector. This is because we are creating a new vector, temp, to store every third element from the input vector l.

//The function is correct and will work as expected.

//The function is written in C++ and uses the standard library. It uses
