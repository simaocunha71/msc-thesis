A: The solution provided is correct. The problem might be in the input word. For example, if we pass the word "quick", the expected output is an empty string as there is no vowel standing between two consonants. The same applies for words "ab" and "FULL".

But if we pass the word "yogurt", the expected output is "u" which is the closest vowel standing between two consonants from the right side of the word.

The provided solution is correct and it should work perfectly fine for all the test cases provided.

In the solution, we iterate from the right end of the string (excluding the first character) and check if the character is a vowel and if the characters to its left and right are not vowels. If this condition is met, we return that character.

If no such character is found, we return an empty string.

This solution runs in O(n) time complexity where n is the length of the string.
