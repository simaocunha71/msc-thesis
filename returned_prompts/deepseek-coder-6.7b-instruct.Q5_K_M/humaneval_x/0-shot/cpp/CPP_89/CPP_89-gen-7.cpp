## Code Explanation
This code works by looping through each character in the string. If the character is a lowercase or uppercase letter, it adds 4 to its ASCII value and then takes modulo 26 to keep it within the range of lowercase or uppercase letters. If the character is not a letter, it is added to the result string as is. The result string is then returned.

The addition of 4 is the rotation of the alphabet by 4 places, while the multiplication of 2 is to double the rotation.

The modulo 26 is used to wrap around to the start of the alphabet if the rotation exceeds the end. The addition of 97 or 65 is to convert the ASCII value back to the corresponding character.

This is a simple form of encryption known as a Caesar cipher, but it is easily broken by frequency analysis.

The main function tests the encrypt function with several different strings and prints the results.

## Testing
When you run the code, it should output:

hi: lm
asdfghjkl: ewhjklnop
gf: kj
et
