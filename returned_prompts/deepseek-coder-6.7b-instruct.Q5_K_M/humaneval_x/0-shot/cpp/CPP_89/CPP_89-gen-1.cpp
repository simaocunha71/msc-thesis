A: Here is the solution for your problem:

#include<iostream>
#include<string>
using namespace std;

string encrypt(string s) {
    string result = "";
    for(int i=0; i<s.length(); i++) {
        if(isupper(s[i]))
            result += char(int(s[i]+2-65)%26 +65);
        else
            result += char(int(s[i]+2-97)%26 +97);
    }
    return result;
}

int main() {
    string s;
    cout<<"Enter a string: ";
    cin>>s;
    cout << "Encrypted string: "<< encrypt(s)<<endl;
    return 0;
}

This program reads a string, then encrypts it by shifting each character two places down the alphabet. If the character is uppercase, it will wrap around to the start of the alphabet when it reaches 'Z'. If the character is lowercase, it will wrap around to the start of the alphabet when it reaches 'z'. The 'char(int(s[i]+2-65)%26 +65)' and 'char(int(s[i]+2-97)%26 +97)' are used to shift the characters and wrap around the alphabet. The result is a string that has been encrypted.

For example, if you input "hi", the output will be "jk". If you input "asdfghjkl", the output will be "cwfhijkml".

This program uses the modulo operator, which is the remainder of a division operation. For example, 10 % 3 is 1, because 3 goes into 10 three times with a remainder of 1. This is used to wrap around the alphabet.

This program assumes that the input string only contains letters and spaces. If the input string contains numbers, punctuation, or other characters, the program will not work correctly.

You can use this program as a starting point, and modify it to suit your needs. For example, you might want to add error checking to make sure the input string
