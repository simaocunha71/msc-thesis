A: The given code does not contain any error. It reads an integer input n from the user, passes it to the function sum_to_n and then prints the result. The function sum_to_n calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to n using a for loop.
The time complexity of this program is O(n) because of the for loop that runs n times.

A: The code you posted is written in C++, and it seems you are trying to use it in a C++ environment. However, the code is written in C syntax.
If you want to use this code in a C++ environment, you should remove the using namespace std; line and the int main() function. Here's how your code should look like:

```C++
#include<iostream>

int sum_to_n(int n){
    int sum=0;
    for(int i=1; i<=n; i++){
        sum += i;
    }
    return sum;
}

int main(){
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;
    std::cout << sum_to_n(n);
    return 0;
}
```

This code does the same thing as yours, but it uses the iostream library for input and output operations.

If you want to use this code in a C environment, you should replace the scanf and printf functions with the fscanf and fprintf functions:

```C
#include<stdio.h>

int sum_to_n(int n){
    int sum=0;
    for(int i=1; i<=n; i++){
        sum += i;
    }
    return sum;
}

int main(){
    int n;
    fscanf(stdin, "%d", &n);
    fprintf(stdout, "%d
