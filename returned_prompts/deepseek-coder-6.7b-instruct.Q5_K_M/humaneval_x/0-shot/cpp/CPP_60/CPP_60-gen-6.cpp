// This is the C++ version of the given problem statement.
// The sum_to_n function sums numbers from 1 to n.
// The main function calls sum_to_n and prints the return values.
// The for loop in the sum_to_n function sums the numbers from 1 to n.
// The time complexity of this function is O(n).
// The space complexity of this function is O(1), as it uses a constant amount of space.
// The function returns the sum of the numbers from 1 to n.
// The main function returns 0.
// The printf function is used to print the return values of sum_to_n.
// The sum_to_n function is a linear operation, as it iterates through the numbers from 1 to n.
// The time complexity of the main function is O(1), as it calls sum_to_n once.
// The space complexity of the main function is O(1), as it uses a constant amount of space.
// The main function returns 0 to indicate that the program has ended successfully.
// The printf function is used to print the return values of sum_to_n.
// The sum_to_n function returns the sum of the numbers from 1 to n.
// The main function returns 0 to indicate that the program has ended successfully.
// The printf function is used to print the return values of sum_to_n.
