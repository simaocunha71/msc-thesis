The code checks if the vector elements are either strictly increasing or decreasing. If the vector elements are not strictly increasing or decreasing, the function returns false. If the vector elements are either strictly increasing or decreasing, the function returns true.

The function works by iterating through the vector. If the current element is less than or equal to the previous element, it continues to the next element. If the current element is greater than the previous element, it checks the rest of the vector for elements that are greater than or equal to the previous element. If it finds one, it continues to the next element. If it doesn't find one, it returns false. If it finishes checking the rest of the vector without finding one, it returns true.

The function also handles the case where the vector is empty or has only one element, in which case it returns true.
