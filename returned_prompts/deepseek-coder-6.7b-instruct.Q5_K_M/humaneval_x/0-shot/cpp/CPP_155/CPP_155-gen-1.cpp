This code defines a function called `even_odd_count` that takes an integer as input. The function returns a vector of two elements: the first one is the count of even digits and the second one is the count of odd digits in the input number.

The function works by first initializing a vector of two zeros. It then goes into a loop that continues until the input number is zero. In each loop iteration, it gets the last digit of the number (using the modulo operator), checks if it's even or odd, and increments the corresponding counter in the result vector. It then removes the last digit from the number (using integer division).

The main function tests the `even_odd_count` function with the numbers -12 and 123, and prints the results.

Note that the function uses the `abs` function to ensure that it works correctly with negative numbers.
