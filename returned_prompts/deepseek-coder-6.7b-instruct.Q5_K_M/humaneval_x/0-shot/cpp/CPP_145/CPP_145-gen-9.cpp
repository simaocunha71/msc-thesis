The code you provided is a C++ implementation of the problem. It calculates the sum of the digits for each number in the vector, and then sorts the numbers based on their sums. If two numbers have the same sum of digits, the one with smaller index comes first.

The main function reads the number of elements and the elements from the user, calls the `order_by_points` function with the input numbers, and then prints the ordered numbers.

The function `order_by_points` takes a vector of integers as input, calculates the sum of their digits for each number,
