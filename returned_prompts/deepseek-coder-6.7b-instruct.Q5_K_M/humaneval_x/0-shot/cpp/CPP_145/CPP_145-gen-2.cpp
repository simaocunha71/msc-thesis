The function works by first iterating through the provided vector, for each number it computes the sum of its digits and stores this value along with the original number in a new vector of pairs.
The pairs are then sorted based on the sum of their digits.
Finally, the function iterates through the sorted pairs and stores the original numbers in a new vector which is returned.
