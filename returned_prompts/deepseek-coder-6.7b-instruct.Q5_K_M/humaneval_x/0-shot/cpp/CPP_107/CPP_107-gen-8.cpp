The main function in the code uses the variable 'n' to call the function even_odd_palindrome. The function then iterates from 1 to n, converting each integer to a string. It then checks if the string is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse. If they are equal, it checks the length of the string. If it's even, it increments the first element of the result vector. If it's odd, it increments the second element of the result vector.

Finally, it returns the result vector, which contains the number of even and odd palindromes.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n*m), where n is the number of integers and m is the average length of the integers, as it needs to convert each integer to a string, check if it's a palindrome, and check its length.

It also has a space complexity of O(n), as it needs to store the result vector.

Note: The solution assumes that the input number is positive and within the range of 1 to 10^3. It doesn't handle cases where the input is not within the range.
