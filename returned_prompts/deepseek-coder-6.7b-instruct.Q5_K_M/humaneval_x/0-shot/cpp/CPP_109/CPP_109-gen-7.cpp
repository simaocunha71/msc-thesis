The function move_one_ball(arr) takes a vector of integers as input and returns a boolean value. If the vector is empty, it returns true. Then it counts the number of times the next number is smaller than the current number. If the last number is greater than the first number, it also counts this. If the count is greater than 1, it returns false. Otherwise, it returns true.

This function works by checking the number of times the next number is smaller than the current number, which corresponds to the number of times a right shift operation is needed to sort the vector in non-decreasing order. If the count is greater than 1, it means that more than one right shift operation is needed, so the function returns false. Otherwise, it returns true.

The main function is used to test the function move_one_ball with the vector {3, 4, 5, 1, 2}. The result of the function is then printed.
