A: The program works by counting the number of times the current number in the array is greater than the next number. If the next number is smaller, it means that a shift is needed. The array is circular, so we also need to check if the last element is greater than the first one. If there are more than 1 such shifts, it is impossible to sort the array, so the function returns false. Otherwise, it returns true.

The time complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the length of the array. This is because it scans the array once. 

The space complexity is O(1), which means it uses a constant amount of memory. This is because it only uses a few variables, regardless of the size of the input array.

In conclusion, this program is efficient and works correctly.


A: The code you've written works perfectly fine. It checks if the condition for non-decreasing order is met by performing a right shift operation.

*

*If the vector is empty, it returns true as there's no need to sort.

*It iterates through the vector, checking if each element is greater than the next one. If it is, it increments a counter.

*It then
