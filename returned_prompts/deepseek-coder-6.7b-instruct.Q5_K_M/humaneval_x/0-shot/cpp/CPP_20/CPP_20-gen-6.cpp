A: Your current code is not working because you're trying to return two floating point numbers as if they were integers. In C++, you can't return a pair of floating point numbers as if they were integers, since the standard library doesn't provide this functionality.
Instead, you should return a pair of floats, or a vector of two floats.
Here's a revised version of your code that returns a pair of floats:
```
#include<stdio.h>
#include<math.h>
#include<vector>
#include<algorithm>
#include<utility>
using namespace std;

pair<float, float> find_closest_elements(vector<float> numbers){

    float diff = 0;
    float min_diff = abs(numbers[0] - numbers[1]);
    pair<float, float> result = make_pair(numbers[0], numbers[1]);

    for(int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++){
        for(int j = i+1; j < numbers.size(); j++){
            diff = abs(numbers[i] -
