    string vowels = "aeiouAEIOU";
    for(int i = 0; i < vowels.size(); i++){
        text.erase(remove(text.begin(), text.end(), vowels[i]), text.end());
    }
    return text;
}

int main(){
    printf("%s", remove_vowels("abcdef\nghijklm").c_str());
}


A: The remove_vowels function can be written as follows using C++ STL:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cctype>

std::string remove_vowels(std::string text) {
    std::string vowels = "aeiouAEIOU";
    for(char vowel : vowels) {
        text.erase(std::remove(text.begin(), text.end(), vowel), text.end());
    }
    return text;
}

int main() {
    std::cout << remove_vowels("abcdef\nghijklm");
    return 0;
}
```

This program defines a function remove_vowels that removes all vowels from a string. It uses the std::remove function to remove the vowels from the string, and then std::erase to actually remove the characters. The algorithm is case-insensitive, so it will remove both lowercase and uppercase vowels. The main function tests the remove_vowels function with the string "abcdef\nghijklm".

Please note that the C++ standard library doesn't support the '\n' character for vowel detection, so you will get a warning. You may want to replace '\n' with a space or another character depending on your requirements.

Also, in the original question, the '\n' character is not being removed. If you want to remove it as well, you should modify the remove_vowels function to do so.

This solution uses the C++ standard library, so it should work with any C++ compiler.

A: The code you've posted is almost correct. The issue is that the std::remove() function doesn't actually remove the elements from the container, it
