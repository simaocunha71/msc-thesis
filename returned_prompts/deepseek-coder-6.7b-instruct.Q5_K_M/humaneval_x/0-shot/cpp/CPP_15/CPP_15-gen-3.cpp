    string sequence = "";
    for(int i=0;i<=n;i++){
        sequence += to_string(i);
        if(i<n) sequence += " ";
    }
    return sequence;
}

int main(){
    printf("%s\n", string_sequence(5).c_str());
    return 0;
}
```

Output:
```
0 1 2 3 4 5
```

Explanation:
Here, we are creating a string sequence in C++ which starts from 0 up to n (inclusive) with a space in between each number. For this, we are using a for loop where i ranges from 0 to n (inclusive). We convert each number i to a string using the to_string() function and append it to the sequence string. We also add a space after each number except the last one, to ensure there is no space at the end of the string.

This program will return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.

You can change the value of n in main() function to check for different values of n.

This code is written in C++ and it uses the standard library string class to manipulate strings. The function to_string() is used to convert integer to string.

The time complexity of this program is O(n) as there is a single loop that runs n times, where n is the input number. The space complexity is also O(n) as we are storing the string sequence in memory.

#include <iostream>
#include <string>

std::string string_sequence(int n) {
    std::string sequence = "";
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        sequence += std::to_string(i);
        if (i < n) sequence += " ";
    }
    return sequence;
}

int main() {
    std::cout << string_sequence(5) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}

/*
Output:
0 1 2 3 4 5
*/

// Time Complexity: O(n)
// Space Complexity: O(n)
