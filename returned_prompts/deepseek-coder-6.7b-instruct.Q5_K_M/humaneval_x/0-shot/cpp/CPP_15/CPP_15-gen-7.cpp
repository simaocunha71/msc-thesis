## Explanation

This program will generate a string of space-separated numbers from 0 to `n`. The algorithm works by iterating over the range of numbers from 0 to `n` (inclusive) and for each number, it converts it to a string and appends it to the `sequence` string. It also adds a space after each number except the last one.

The `main` function is used to test the `string_sequence` function. It calls `string_sequence` with 0 and 5 as arguments and prints the returned strings.

The `to_string` function is used to convert each number to a string.

The `+=` operator is used to append the string to the `sequence` string.

The `if` statement checks if the current number is less than `n`. If it is, a space is appended to the `sequence` string.

The `return` statement returns the `sequence` string.

The `string` class is used to create and manipulate strings in C++.

The `printf` function is used to print the returned strings. The `%s` format specifier is used to print a string. The `.c_str()` method is used to convert the string to a C string.

The `main` function returns 0 to signify that the program has ended successfully.

## Output

```
0
0 1 2 3 4 5
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this program is O(n) because it iterates over the range of numbers from 0 to `n`.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity of this program is O(n) because it creates a new string of space-separated numbers from 0 to `n`.
