The question seems to be related to numerical methods. Here is a simple implementation of the bisection method to find a root of a polynomial. The bisection method is a root-finding method that applies to any continuous functions for which one knows two values with opposite signs.

```cpp
double bisection_method(vector<double> xs, double x_lower, double x_upper, double epsilon){
    /*
    xs are coefficients of a polynomial. bisection_method find x such that poly(x) = 0.
    x_lower and x_upper are the initial guess
