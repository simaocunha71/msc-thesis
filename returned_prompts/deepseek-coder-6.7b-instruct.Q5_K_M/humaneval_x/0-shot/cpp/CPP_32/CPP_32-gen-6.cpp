It appears there is some misunderstanding. The question asks for a function that finds a root of a polynomial with even number of coefficients. The code you posted checks for a polynomial with odd number of coefficients. In fact, the code checks for a polynomial with even number of coefficients.

The function `poly` seems fine. It's a simple implementation of a polynomial evaluation. It takes a vector of coefficients (xs) and a point (x) at which the polynomial is evaluated, and returns the result of the evaluation.

The function `find_zero` seems to be a function to find a root of a polynomial. It takes a vector of coefficients, calculates the first derivative of the polynomial, finds a zero of the derivative (which is a point where the derivative is zero), and returns this point.

However, this function only works for polynomials of even degree (number of coefficients is even) and it assumes that the largest coefficient is non-zero. This is because the Newton-Raphson method used in `find_zero` works better if the initial guess is near the root and the function is not too steep.

The Newton-Raphson method is not guaranteed to find a root for all polynomials, especially for polynomials of odd degree. If there is no root near the initial guess, the method can get stuck in an infinite loop.

Here is the corrected `find_zero` function:

```cpp
double find_zero(vector<double> xs, double initial_guess = 0.0){
    double x = initial_guess;
    double epsilon = 1e-6;
    while (fabs(poly(xs, x)) > epsilon) {
        x = x - poly(xs, x) / poly(derivative(xs), x);
    }
    return x;
}
```

In this function, `derivative` is a function that returns the derivative of a polynomial. `epsilon` is a small value that determines when the zero of the function is found. `initial_guess` is the initial guess for the Newton-Raphson method.

Please note that this function assumes that there is a root near the initial guess and that the function is not too steep. If these assumptions are not met, the function may not find a root.

Also, this function is not guaranteed to find a root for all polynomials
