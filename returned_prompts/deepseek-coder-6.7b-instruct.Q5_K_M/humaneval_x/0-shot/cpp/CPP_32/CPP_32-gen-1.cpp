This question asks for a root-finding algorithm for a polynomial equation, which could be solved using Newton-Raphson method. However, finding a root for a polynomial is a non-trivial task and this method requires the derivative of the function to be evaluated at the initial guess. 

In the case of polynomials with even coefficients, the polynomial will have an even number of roots. As such, the polynomial will have at least one root that is a zero of the function. Therefore, you can use the fact that the function is zero to solve the problem.

Here is a simple implementation of the function `find_zero`:

```cpp
double find_zero(vector<double> xs){
    // As we know that the polynomial has a root at x = 0, we return 0.
    return 0;
}
```

This function will always return 0, because the polynomial equation `poly(x) = 0` has its only root at `x = 0`.

Please note that this function assumes that the polynomial has at least one root that is zero. It does not handle the case where the polynomial has no roots.

This function also does not handle the case where the polynomial has even coefficients. It does not guarantee to find a zero, even if the polynomial has a zero as a root. It's because the polynomial may have zeros at other points, and the function does not know how to find those.

In conclusion, the function does not provide a correct solution to the problem, but it serves as a placeholder to demonstrate how such a function might be implemented.
