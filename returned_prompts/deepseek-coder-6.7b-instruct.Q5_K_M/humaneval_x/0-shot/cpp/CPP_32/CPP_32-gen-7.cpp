The function find_zero is searching for a root of the polynomial with coefficients xs. The method it uses is a simple bisection method. It starts with two initial guesses: x1 = -1000 and x2 = 1000. It then computes the value of the polynomial at both guesses and if the product is negative, it means that the root is between x1 and x2. If the product is positive, the root is between x2 and x1. The method continues this process until the difference between x1 and x2 is less than a certain small number, say 1e-6.

Here is the code for the function find_zero:

```cpp
double find_zero(vector<double> xs){
    double x1 = -1000, x2 = 1000;
    while ((x2-x1) > 1e-6){
        double y1 = poly(xs, x1);
        double y2 = poly(xs, x2);
        if (y1*y2 < 0){
            return (x1+x2)/2;
        }
        else if (y1*y2 > 0){
            if (y1 < 0){
                x1 = x1 + 1;
            }
            else{
                x2 = x2 - 1;
            }
        }
    }
    return (x1+x2)/2;
}
```
This function assumes that the polynomial has at least one root in the interval [-1000, 1000]. If this is not the case, the function will not find the root.

Note: The bisection method assumes that the polynomial changes sign between the two initial guesses. If the polynomial does not change sign between the two initial guesses, the function will not find the root.

This function works with polynomials of degree 1, 2, 3, ..., n. However, it can be slow for very large polynomials because it uses a brute force method to find the root.

Also, it's important to note that the function assumes that the polynomial changes sign between the two initial guesses. If the polynomial does not change sign between the two initial guesses, the function will not find the root.
