The function find_zero is supposed to find a root of the polynomial with coefficients given in the vector xs. It does this by using the Newton-Raphson method. The Newton-Raphson method is a root-finding algorithm that uses the iterative formula:

x[n+1] = x[n] - f(x[n]) / f'(x[n])

where f'(x[n]) is the derivative of the function at x[n].

The function poly is used to evaluate the polynomial at a given point, and the function poly_derivative is used to evaluate the derivative of the polynomial at a given point.

The algorithm starts with an initial guess x[0] = 0, and iteratively applies the Newton-Raphson update until the absolute value of the difference between x[n+1] and x[n] is less than a small threshold (1e-6 in this case).

Here is the corrected code:

```cpp
#include<stdio.h>
#include<math.h>
#include<vector>
using namespace std;

double poly(vector<double> xs, double x){
    double sum=0;
    int i;
    for  (i=0;i<xs.size();i++)
    {
        sum+=xs[i]*pow(x,i);
    }
    return sum;
}

double poly_derivative(vector<double> xs, double x){
    double sum=0;
    int i;
    for  (i=1;i<xs.size();i++)
    {
        sum+=i*xs[i]*pow(x,i-1);
    }
    return sum;
}

double find_zero(vector<double> xs){
    double x = 0;
    double next_x;
    do {
        next_x = x - poly(xs, x) / poly_derivative(xs, x);
        if (fabs(next_x - x) < 1e-6) {
            return next_x;
        }
        x = next_x;
    } while (true);
}
```
