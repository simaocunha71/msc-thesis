The function find_zero is using the bisection method to find the roots of the polynomial given by the coefficients in the vector xs. The bisection method is a root-finding algorithm that applies to any continuous function for which one knows two values with opposite signs. In this case, we know that the polynomial has at least one root between x = a and x = b (a and b are the endpoints of the interval). If f(a) and f(b) have different signs, the bisection method will find a root in the interval [a, b]. If they have the same sign, the function must have at least one root in the interval (a, b).

Here is the implementation of the function find_zero:

double find_zero(vector<double> xs, double a, double b, double epsilon){
    double c;
    while ((b-a) >= epsilon){
        c = (a+b)/2;
        if (poly(xs, a) * poly(xs, c) < 0)
            b = c;
        else
            a = c;
    }
    return (a+b)/2;
}

In this implementation, epsilon is the precision of the solution. The function returns the root of the polynomial xs in the interval [a, b]. 

Please note that the function find_zero is only applicable to polynomials with even number of coefficients and the largest non zero coefficient as it guarantees a solution. The function will not return the correct result for polynomials with odd number of coefficients or if the largest non zero coefficient is zero.

In the main function, you need to call the function find_zero with the coefficients of the polynomial, and the initial guesses for the interval in which the root lies. For example:

int main() {
    vector<double> xs = {-6, 11, -6, 1};
    double root = find_zero(xs, 0, 2, 0.0001);
    printf("The root of the polynomial is: %.2f\n", root);
    return 0;
}

This will find the root of the polynomial xs = -6 +11x -6x^2 +x^3 using the bisection method and print the result.
