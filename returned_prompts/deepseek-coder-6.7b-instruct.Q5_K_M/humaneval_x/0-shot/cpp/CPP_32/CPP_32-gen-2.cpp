The function `find_zero` is not implemented. However, it can be implemented using the bisection method to find the roots of a polynomial. Here is a possible implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

double poly(vector<double> xs, double x) {
    double sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < xs.size(); i++) {
        sum += xs[i] * pow(x, i);
    }
    return sum;
}

double find_zero(vector<double> xs, double a = -10.0, double b = 10.0, double epsilon = 0.00001) {
    double c = a;
    while ((b-a) >= epsilon) {
        c = (a+b)/2;
        if (poly(xs, c) == 0.0) {
            break;
        }
        else if (poly(xs, c)*poly(xs, a) < 0) {
            b = c;
        }
        else {
            a = c;
        }
    }
    return c;
}

int main() {
    vector<double> xs = {-6, 11, -6, 1};
    cout << "The root is " << find_zero(xs) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
This code uses the bisection method to find a root of the polynomial defined by the coefficients in `xs`. It starts with an initial interval `[a, b]` and repeatedly bisects this interval until the interval width is less than `epsilon`. The function `poly` is used to evaluate the polynomial at a given point.

Please note that the bisection method may not always converge to a root, especially for polynomials with many roots or for polynomials that do not cross the x-axis.

Also note that the coefficients in `xs` should be in decreasing order, as in the example in the question.

The `find_zero` function in the question specifies that it only takes lists with even number of coefficients, but the implementation here does not enforce this
