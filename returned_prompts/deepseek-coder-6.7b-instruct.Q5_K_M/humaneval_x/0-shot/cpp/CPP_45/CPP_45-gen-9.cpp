return (0.5)*a*h;

This line of code calculates the area of a triangle using the formula (0.5)*base*height. The base and height are provided as parameters to the function, so a and h are used in this calculation. The result of this calculation is then returned by the function.

The main() function is where the program starts. This function prompts the user to enter the length of the side and the height of the triangle, then calls the triangle_area() function with these values to calculate the area. The result is then printed to the console.

The return 0; statement at the end of the main() function signifies that the program has executed successfully.

In summary, this code is a simple program that calculates the area of a triangle
