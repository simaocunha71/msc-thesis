A: The code loops over all numbers from 1 to n-1, checking if each number is divisible by 11 or 13. If it is, it converts the number to a string and counts the number of times '7' appears in it.

B: The if condition checks if the number is divisible by 11 or 13. If it is, it proceeds to the next step.

C: The sprintf function converts the number to a string. The strchr function then searches the string for the character '7'. If it finds one, it increments the count and continues searching for more '7's. It stops when it doesn't find any more '7's.

The total count is then returned.

In the main function, the fizz_buzz function is called with different arguments, and the result is printed.

A: This code is in C++, not C. It uses standard C++ library functions.
Here is the program logic:

A: Initialize a count variable to 0.
B: Iterate from 1 to n-1.
C: Check if the number is divisible by 11 or 13.
D: If yes, convert the number to a string and count the number of times '7' appears in it.
