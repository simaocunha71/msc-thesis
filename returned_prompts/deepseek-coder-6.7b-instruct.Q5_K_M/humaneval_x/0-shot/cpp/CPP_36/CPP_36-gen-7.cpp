A: 
The function fizz_buzz(n) returns the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.

The function works by iterating over the integers less than n. If an integer is divisible by 11 or 13, it is converted to a string and each digit is checked. If the digit is '7', the count is incremented. The function returns the total count.

The time complexity of this function is O(n) because it iterates over each number less than n. The space complexity is O(1) because it uses a constant amount of space to store the count and temporary variables.
