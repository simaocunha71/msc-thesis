In the provided code, we start with the smallest even number 2 and add it to a running total sum. We then increment by 2 to get the next even number. We continue this process until the sum of the numbers is greater than or equal to n. If the sum is equal to n, we return true, meaning n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. If not, we return false.

The main function demonstrates this by calling the function is_equal_to_sum_even for the values 4, 6, and 8. It then prints the result as either "true" or "false".

In the first case, 4 can't be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers, so the function returns false and "false" is printed.

In the second case, 6 can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers (2+2+2+2), so the function returns true and "true" is printed.

In the third case, 8 can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers (2+2+2+2), so the function returns true and "true" is printed.

This code could be improved by adding some error checking for invalid input (like negative numbers).
