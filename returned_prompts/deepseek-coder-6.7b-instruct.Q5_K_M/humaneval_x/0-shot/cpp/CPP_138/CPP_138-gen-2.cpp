This code checks for every possible combination of 4 positive even numbers that add up to the given number. If at least one such combination exists, it returns true, otherwise, it returns false. However, the time complexity of this code is quite high (O(n^4) in this case). It might not work efficiently for large numbers. 

A: The problem is that the code is not efficient for large numbers.

In fact, it's not even necessary to check all possible combinations of 4 numbers. You can see this from the structure of the problem:

If n is an even number, it can be written as the sum of 2 even numbers. Therefore, you can write any even number as the sum of 4 even numbers if you also add 2 more even numbers.

So, if n is an even number, you can always write it as the sum of 4 even numbers (2,2,2,2). If n is an odd number, you can always write it as the sum of 4 odd numbers (1,1,1,1). 

So, you can simplify the function to return true for all even numbers and false for all odd numbers.

Here is the optimized code:

```cpp
#include<stdio.h>
using namespace std;
bool is_equal_to_sum_even(int n){
    return n % 2 == 0;
}

int main()
{
    printf("%d", is_equal_to_sum_even(8));
    return 0
