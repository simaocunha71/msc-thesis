This code takes an integer input n and checks if it can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. It generates the first 4 even numbers and adds them up. If the sum is equal to n, it returns true, else it returns false.

The code is written in C++ as it's tagged in the question. If you want to run this code in another language, you might need to adjust it.
