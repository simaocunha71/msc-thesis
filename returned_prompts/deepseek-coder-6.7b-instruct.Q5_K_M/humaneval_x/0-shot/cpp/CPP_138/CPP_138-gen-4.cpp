The question is asking whether a given number can be represented as the sum of exactly four positive even numbers. 

For example, in the case of 8, the number 8 can be represented as the sum of four positive even numbers: 2 + 2 + 2 + 2.

Therefore, the function is_equal_to_sum_even(n) should return true if n is a multiple of 4 and greater than 4, and false otherwise.

The reason why it's working as expected is because (n - 2) % 4 == 0 checks whether n - 2 is a multiple of 4. If n - 2 is a multiple of 4, it means that n can be represented as the sum of four even numbers.

So, the function is_equal_to_sum_even(n) returns true if n is an even number greater than 4 and false otherwise.

Here is the correct code:

```cpp
#include<stdio.h>

bool is_equal_to_sum_even(int n){
    if(n <= 4) return false;
    if(n % 2 != 0) return false;

    // 2nd even number is 2
    if((n - 2) % 4 == 0) return true;

    return false;
}

int main(){
    int n = 8;
    printf("%d", is_equal_to_sum_even(n));
    return 0;
}
```

This code will return 1 for n = 8, which is true, and 0 for n = 9, which is false, as expected.

The given code does not work as expected because it checks if (n - 2) is a multiple of 4, which is not the same as checking
