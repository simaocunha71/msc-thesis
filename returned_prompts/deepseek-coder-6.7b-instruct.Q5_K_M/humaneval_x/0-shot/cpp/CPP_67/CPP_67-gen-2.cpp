A: The first loop of the program scans the string s to find out the number of apples and oranges. The variable apples and oranges are initialized to 0. 

B: Inside the loop, the program checks each character in the string. If the character is 'a', it means that the next character represents the number of apples. The number of apples is calculated by multiplying the current number of apples by 10 (to accommodate the new digit) and adding the new digit. If the character is 'o', it means that the next character represents the number of oranges. The number of oranges is calculated in the same way as the number of apples. If the character is neither 'a' nor 'o', the program simply moves to the next character.

C: After the loop, the program calculates the number of mangoes by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits.

D: Finally, the program returns the number of mangoes.

This program assumes that the input string is well-formed, meaning it starts with the number of apples, followed by the word "apples", followed by the word "and", followed by the number of oranges, followed by the word "oranges". The numbers of apples and oranges are always single-digit numbers.
