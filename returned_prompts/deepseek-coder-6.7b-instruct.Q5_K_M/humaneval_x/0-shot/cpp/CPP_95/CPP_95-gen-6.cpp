The problem is that the function is returning true for cases where there are both lower case and upper case letters in the keys. The function should return true only if all keys are either in upper case or lower case. This can be achieved by checking only for one case (either lower or upper).

Here is the corrected code:

```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<string>
#include<map>
using namespace std;

bool check_map_case(map<string,string> dict){

    if(dict.empty())
        return false;

    bool all_upper = true, all_lower = true;
