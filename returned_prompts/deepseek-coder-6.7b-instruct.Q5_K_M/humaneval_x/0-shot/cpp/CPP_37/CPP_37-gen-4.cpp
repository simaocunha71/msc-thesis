The function 'sort_even' takes a vector of float numbers as input and returns a new vector in which elements at even indices are sorted in ascending order while elements at odd indices are left unchanged.

The function works by first dividing the input vector into two separate vectors, one for elements at even indices (evenIndices) and one for elements at odd indices (oddIndices). It then sorts the evenIndices vector in ascending order.

Finally, it constructs a new vector (result) by alternating between elements from the evenIndices vector and the oddIndices vector. The elements from evenIndices are added first, then the elements from oddIndices.

Finally, the function returns the new vector (result).

The time complexity of this function is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation. The space complexity is O(n) as it creates new vectors for the even and odd indices.

Here is the python code equivalent to the above C++ code:

```python
def sort_even(l):
    evenIndices = [l[i] for i in range(len(l)) if i % 2 == 0]
    oddIndices = [l[i] for i in range(len(l)) if i % 2 != 0]
    evenIndices.sort()
    result = []
    e = 0
