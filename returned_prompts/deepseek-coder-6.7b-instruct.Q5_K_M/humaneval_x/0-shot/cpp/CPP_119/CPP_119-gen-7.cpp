Here is a C++ solution. We will use a stack to keep track of the parentheses. If we encounter an open parenthesis, we push it into the stack. If we encounter a closed parenthesis, we check if the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is an open parenthesis. If both conditions are met, we pop the open parenthesis from the stack. If the stack is empty or the top of the stack is not an open parenthesis, we return "No". If we are able to process all the characters in the string without returning "No", we return "Yes".

```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<stack>
#include<vector>
#include<string>
using namespace std;

string match_parens(vector<string> lst) {
    stack<char> s;
    for (string str : lst) {
        for (char c : str) {
            if (c == '(') {
                s.push(c);
            } else if (c == ')') {
                if (!s.empty() && s.top() == '(') {
                    s.pop();
                } else {
                    return "No";
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return s.empty() ? "Yes" : "No";
}

int main() {
    vector<string> lst = {"()(", ")"};
    cout << match_parens(lst) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This will print "Yes" as the string "()(" can be balanced by adding a closing parenthesis at the end, resulting in "()()".

This solution assumes that the input strings are balanced in the sense that they do not contain any extra closing parentheses. If this is not the case, additional error checking would be needed.

Also, it assumes that the input strings are well-formed and do not contain any other characters than parentheses. If this is not the case, additional
