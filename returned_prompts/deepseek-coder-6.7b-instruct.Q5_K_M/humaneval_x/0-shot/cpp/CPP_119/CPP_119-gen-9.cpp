This problem is asking to check if it is possible to make a balanced parentheses string from the given two strings by removing some parentheses.

The idea is to count the number of open and closed parentheses in both strings and then compare them. If the number of closed parentheses in the first string is more than the open parentheses in the second string, then it is not possible to make a balanced parentheses string. If the number of open parentheses in the second string is more than the closed parentheses in the first string, then it is not possible to make a balanced parentheses string.

If the total number of open and closed parentheses in both strings are equal, then it is possible to make a balanced parentheses string.

Therefore, the function `match_parens` counts the open and closed parentheses in the given strings and checks if the total number of open and closed parentheses in both strings are equal. If they are equal, it returns "Yes", otherwise it returns "No".

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the total length of the two strings. The space complexity is O(1), because we only use a constant amount of space to store the counts of open and closed parentheses.

This solution is correct because it correctly handles all possible edge cases and doesn't over
