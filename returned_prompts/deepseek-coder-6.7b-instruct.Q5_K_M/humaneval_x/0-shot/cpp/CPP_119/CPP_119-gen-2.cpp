A: 
Here is a Python solution for this problem. The idea is to count the number of unmatched open and close parentheses. If the sum of unmatched open and close parentheses is 0, then the string is good. If it's not 0, then the string is not good.

```python
def match_parens(lst):
    unmatched = 0
    for s in lst:
        for ch in s:
            if ch == '(':
                unmatched += 1
            elif ch == ')':
                unmatched -= 1
            if unmatched < 0:   # If there's a closing parenthesis without a matching opening one
                return "No"
    return "Yes" if unmatched == 0 else "No"

print(match_parens(["()(", ")"]))  # Output: Yes
print(match_parens([")", ")"])  # Output: No
```

In this code, we iterate over each character in each string in the list. If we encounter an opening parenthesis, we increment `unmatched`. If we encounter a closing parenthesis, we decrement `unmatched`. If `unmatched` becomes negative, it means we have more closing parentheses than opening ones, which means the string is not good. After we finish iterating over all characters in all strings, we check if `unmatched` is 0. If it is, the string is good. Otherwise, it's not good.

Time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the total number of characters in all strings in the list.

Space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the count of unmatched parentheses and iterate over the strings.

This solution assumes that the input list
