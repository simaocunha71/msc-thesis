The logic is to count the number of open and closed parentheses in each string, and then check if the count of open parentheses in the first string is less than or equal to the count of closed parentheses in the second string. If it is, then it is possible to concatenate the two strings to form a good string.

Explanation:

The count of open parentheses in the first string is 2, and the count of closed parentheses in the second string is also 2. So, the count of open parentheses in the first string is less than or equal to the count of closed parentheses in the second string, which makes it possible to concatenate the two strings to form a good string. Hence, the answer is "Yes".

Examples:
match_parens({"()", "()"}) → Yes
match_parens({")", ")"}) → No
