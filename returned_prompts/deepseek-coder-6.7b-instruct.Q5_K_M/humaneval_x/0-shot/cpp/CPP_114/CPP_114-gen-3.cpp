The algorithm is using Kadane's algorithm to find the smallest subarray sum. The main idea of the algorithm is to keep track of the running sum and the minimum sum found so far. If the running sum is negative, we reset it to zero because it doesn't contribute to the sum. If the running sum is smaller than the minimum sum found so far, we update the minimum sum.
