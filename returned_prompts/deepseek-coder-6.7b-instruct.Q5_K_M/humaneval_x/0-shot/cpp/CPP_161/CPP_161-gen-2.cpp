This solution works by iterating through the string and checking if each character is an alphabetical character. If it is, it changes its case. If not, it leaves it as it is. Then it checks if the number of characters in the string is even. If it is, it reverses the string. If not, it leaves it as it is.
The complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string.
