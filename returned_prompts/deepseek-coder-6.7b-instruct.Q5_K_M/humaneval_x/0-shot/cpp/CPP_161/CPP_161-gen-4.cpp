## Code Explanation
This program solves the problem by iterating over each character in the string. If the character is an alphabet, it reverses its case and adds it to the result. If the character is not an alphabet, it simply adds it to the front of the result.

## Testing
This program can be tested by running it and providing different inputs. The expected output should be as follows:

solve("1234") = "4321"
solve("ab") = "AB"
solve("#a@C") = "#A@c"

## Conclusion
This program works as expected, reversing the case of letters and otherwise preserving the non-alphabetic characters in the string.
