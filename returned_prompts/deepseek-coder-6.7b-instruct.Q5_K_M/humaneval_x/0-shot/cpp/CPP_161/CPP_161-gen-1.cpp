A: The question is asking to reverse the case of all the alphabets and if there are no alphabets in the string then reverse the whole string.
This can be achieved by using the isalpha() function to check if a character is a letter, and if it is, then change its case. If there are no letters, then reverse the string.
Here is the python code:
def solve(s):
    has_letters = any(c.isalpha() for c in s)
    if has_letters:
        return ''.join(c.upper() if c.islower() else c.lower() for c in s)
    else:
        return s[::-1]

print(solve("1234"))
print(solve("ab"))
print(solve("#a@C"))

In this code, any() function is used to check if there is any alphabet in the string. If there is, then it changes the case of all letters in the string using the join() and lower()/upper() functions. If there are no letters, then it reverses the whole string using slicing.
