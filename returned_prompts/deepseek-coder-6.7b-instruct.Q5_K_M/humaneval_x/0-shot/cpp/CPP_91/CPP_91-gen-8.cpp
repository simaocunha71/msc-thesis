A: The code provided is good, but the problem is that you're using the wrong function to find substrings. You should use the function find(), not rfind().
Here is the corrected version of the code:

```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<string>
using namespace std;

int is_bored(string S){
    int count = 0;
    size_t found = S.find("I");
    while (found != string::npos){
        count++;
        found = S.find("I", found+1);
    }
    return count;
}

int main(){
    cout << is_bored("Hello world") << endl;
    cout << is_bored("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather") << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This code will count the number of sentences that start with the word "I". It does this by using the find() function to search for the substring "I" in the string S. If it finds a substring "I", it increments the count and continues searching for more "I"s. The function returns the count when it has searched the entire string.

The main function calls the is_bored function with two strings and prints the number of boredoms in each string.
The corrected code will output:
0
1

I hope this helps you.
