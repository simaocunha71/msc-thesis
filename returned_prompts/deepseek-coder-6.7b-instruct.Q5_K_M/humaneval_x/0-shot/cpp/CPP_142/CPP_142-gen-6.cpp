The function sum_squares works correctly with the given description. It loops through the vector lst, and for each entry, it checks if the index is a multiple of 3 or 4. If the index is a multiple of 3, the function squares the entry and adds it to the sum. If the index is a multiple of 4 but not 3, the function cubes the entry and adds it to the sum. If the index is not a multiple of 3 or 4, the function simply adds the entry to the sum without changing it. Finally, the function returns the sum.

Here's an example usage of the function:

vector<int> lst = {1, 2, 3};
int sum = sum_squares(lst);
cout << sum << endl;  // Outputs: 6

In this example, the function squares the entry at index 0 (1^2 = 1) and adds it to the sum, then cubes the entry at index 3 (3^3 = 27) and adds it to the sum. The entry at index 2 is not changed. The sum of the entries is 1 + 27 = 30, which is printed out.

In the main function, the function sum_squares is called with a vector of integers {1, 2, 3} as an argument. The function returns the sum of the entries 1 + 4 + 27 = 32, which is printed out.
