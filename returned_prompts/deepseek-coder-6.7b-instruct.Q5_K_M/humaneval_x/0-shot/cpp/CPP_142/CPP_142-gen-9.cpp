This function works by iterating through the vector lst, checking the current index i for divisibility by 3 and 4. If the index is a multiple of 3 
but not 4, the function squares the element at that index and adds it to the sum. If the index is a multiple of 4, the function cubes the 
element and adds it to the sum. If the index is neither a multiple of 3 nor 4, the function simply adds the element to the sum. The function 
then returns the sum.
