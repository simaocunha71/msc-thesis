In the question, the problem is stated as requiring the function to square the number at a multiple of 3 index and cube the number at a multiple of 4 index (excluding multiples of 3). This means if an index is a multiple of 12 (which are multiples of 3 and 4), it should be cubed. The other conditions are not mentioned, so numbers at non-multiple of 3 or 4 indexes are not affected.

In the given example lst = {1,2,3}, the index of 1 is 0 (not a multiple of 3 or 4), the index of 2 is 1 (not a multiple of 3 or 4), the index of 3 is 2 (not a multiple of 3, but is a multiple of 4), so the sum is 1 + 2 + 3*3*3 = 1 + 2 + 27 = 30.

The other examples are handled similarly.
