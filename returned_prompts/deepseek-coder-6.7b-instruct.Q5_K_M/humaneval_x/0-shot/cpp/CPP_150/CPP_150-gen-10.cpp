The given C++ program takes three arguments: n, x, and y. It checks if n is a prime number. If n is prime, it returns x, otherwise it returns y. Prime numbers are numbers that have only 2 factors: 1 and the number itself. So, the program checks if n can be divided evenly by any number from 2 to n/2. If it can, that means n has more factors than just 1 and itself, so it returns y. If n can't be divided evenly by any of these numbers, then it must be a prime number and it returns x. 

The main function is used to test the program by calling the function with different inputs and printing the results.

The program uses the printf function to print the result of the function call.

Overall, the program works as expected.

The C++ program is correct.
