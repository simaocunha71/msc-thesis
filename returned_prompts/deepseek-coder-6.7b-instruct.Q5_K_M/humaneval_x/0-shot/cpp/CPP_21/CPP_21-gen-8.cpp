    float min_val = *min_element(numbers.begin(), numbers.end());
    float max_val = *max_element(numbers.begin(), numbers.end());
    float range = max_val - min_val;

    for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++) {

A: The code provided should work correctly. 
It calculates the minimum and maximum values of the input vector, computes the range by subtracting the minimum from the maximum, and then applies the linear transformation to each element of the vector by subtracting the minimum and dividing by the range. 

This will rescale the values such that the minimum value in the input vector becomes 0 and the maximum value becomes 1.

The output of the function is a new vector with the rescaled values.

It's worth mentioning that the function uses the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) to find the minimum and maximum values of the input vector and to iterate over the vector. The C++ STL provides the functions min_element and max_element for this purpose.

Overall, the function should work correctly for any input vector of floating point numbers. If you encounter any issues, please provide more details about the problem for a more accurate solution.

Remember to include the necessary headers (stdio.h, math.h, vector) at the beginning of your program.

Also, don't forget to return the rescaled vector from the function.

Here is the corrected code:

```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
using namespace std;

vector<float> rescale_to_unit(vector<float> numbers){
    vector<float> result;
    float min_val = *min_element(numbers.begin(), numbers.end());
    float max_val = *max_element(numbers.begin(), numbers.end());
    float range = max_val - min_val;

    for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++) {
        result.push_back((numbers
