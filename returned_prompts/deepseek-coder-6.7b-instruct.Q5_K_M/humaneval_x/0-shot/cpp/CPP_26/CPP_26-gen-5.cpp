A: The question is asking to remove the duplicates from the input vector and keep the order of the elements same as it is in the input.

Here is a Python solution for the same:

def remove_duplicates(numbers):
    unique_nums = []
    for num in numbers:
        if num not in unique_nums:
            unique_nums.append(num)
    return unique_nums

nums = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4]
unique_nums = remove_duplicates(nums)
print(unique_nums)

This will output:
[1, 2, 3, 4]

In the given C++ code, the vector unique_nums is used to store the unique elements from the input vector numbers. The function remove_duplicates sorts the input vector and then iterates over it to check if the current element is the same as the next one. If it is not, then the current element is added to the unique_nums vector. Finally, the function returns the unique_nums vector.

In the main function, the remove_duplicates function is called with the input vector nums, and the result is printed.

Also, keep in mind that the C++ code provided is not completely equivalent to the Python code. The C++ code uses the C++ Standard Library, while the Python code uses built-
