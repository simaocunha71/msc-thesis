This program defines a function `eat` which calculates and returns the number of carrots eaten and the number of carrots left after the meals. If there are not enough carrots remaining, the function will eat all the remaining carrots and return 0 as the number of carrots left. The main function tests this function with some sample inputs and prints the results.

Please note that the problem is quite simple and the constraints are not very strict. This program should work fine for the provided inputs. If you need the program to handle larger inputs, you might need to consider using data types that can handle larger numbers, such as the `long long` data type.

In this problem, we are asked to return a vector of two integers. So, we are using a vector to store the result. The first element of the vector is the total number of eaten carrots after meals and the second element is the number of carrots left after meals.

The time complexity of this program is O(1), as it does not have any loops or recursive calls. The space complexity is also O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of
