```

## Output

```
{11, 4}
```

## Explanation

The program defines a function `eat` that takes 3 parameters: the number of carrots already eaten, the carrots needed to complete meals, and the remaining carrots in stock.

If there are enough remaining carrots, the program adds the needed carrots to the ones already eaten and subtracts them from the remaining stock. The total number of eaten carrots and the remaining carrots are returned in a vector.

Otherwise, if there aren't enough remaining carrots, the program adds all the remaining carrots to the ones already eaten and returns the total number of eaten carrots as is, and 0 as the remaining carrots.

In the `main` function, the `eat` function is called with the given inputs and the result is printed.

The output is `{11, 4}` which means the total number of carrots eaten after meals is 11 and the remaining carrots are 4.

This problem is a simple addition and subtraction problem, and the only tricky part is to handle the situation where there aren't enough remaining carrots.

Note: This code is written in C++ and uses the `vector` library for returning multiple values.
