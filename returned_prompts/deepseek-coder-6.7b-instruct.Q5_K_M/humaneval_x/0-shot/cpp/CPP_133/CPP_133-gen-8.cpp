In this problem, we're asked to round each number in a given list to the nearest integer and then square the result and add it all up.

The solution involves a for loop that iterates through each number in the list. For each number, we use the ceil function from the math library to round the number to the nearest integer. Then we square the rounded number using the pow function from the math library and add it to the sum. Finally, we return the sum.

Here's the C++ code that implements this solution:

#include<iostream>
#include<cmath>
#include<vector>
using namespace std;

int sum_squares(vector<float> lst){
    int sum=0;
    for(int i=0; i<lst.size(); i++){
        lst[i]=ceil(lst[i]);
        sum+=pow(lst[i],2);
    }
    return sum;
}

int main()
{
    vector<float> lst = {1.4,4.2,0};
    cout << sum_squares(lst) << endl;
    return 0;
}

This code will output: 29
*/

The solution is a simple loop over the input list where we apply the ceil function to each element and then square it. The result is then added to a running total.

Here's a Python solution using the same logic:

```python
import math

def sum_squares(lst):
    return sum(math.ceil(x) ** 2 for x in lst)
```

This Python code works by using a generator comprehension to
