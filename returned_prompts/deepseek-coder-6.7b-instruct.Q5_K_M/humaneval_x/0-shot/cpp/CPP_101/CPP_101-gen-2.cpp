The code provided above is a correct implementation of the words_string function in C++. This function uses a for loop to iterate through the input string, character by character. If it encounters a space or a comma, it adds the current word to the vector of words and resets the word string. If it encounters any other character, it simply adds it to the word string. Finally, it pushes the last word if there is one into the vector.

The function is tested and works correctly with both commas and spaces as delimiters, as demonstrated in the question.

The time complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because it needs to iterate through the string once. The space complexity is also O(n), as in the worst case (when there are no spaces or commas), each character could form its own word, so the vector of words would need to store n elements.

So overall, this function is efficient and provides the desired functionality.
