The function iscuber() will take an integer 'a' as input and return a boolean value, indicating whether the absolute value of the integer is a cube of some integer or not. 

The cube root of a number is computed by raising to the power of 1/3. 

The cube root of the absolute value of 'a' is stored in 'n'. 

If 'n' cubed is equal to the absolute value of 'a', then 'a' is a cube of some integer, and the function returns true. 

Otherwise, the function returns false. 

The 'round()' function is used to round the cube root to the nearest integer. This is necessary because the cube root of a number can be a decimal value, which might not be a valid cube. 

The 'abs()' function is used to ensure that the function works correctly for negative numbers. It gets the absolute value of 'a' and computes the cube root of this absolute value. 

Finally, the function 'main()' is used to test the 'iscuber()' function with different inputs.

It should be noted that this function assumes that the input is always valid and does not handle error cases.

In the main function, the result of iscuber() function is printed to the console. If the input is a cube of some integer, it will print '1' (true), otherwise it will print '0' (false).

The time complexity of this function is O(1), as it performs a constant number of operations regardless of the size of the input. The space complexity is also O(1), as it uses a constant amount of space to store
