A: Sorting the vector before removing the duplicates is necessary to ensure that the duplicates are removed in their original order.

B: The unique function from the algorithm library removes all the consecutive duplicates in the range [first, last). It returns an iterator pointing to the new logical end of the range.

C: We return the vector after removing the duplicates.

// End of Code

// Output: 0 2 3 5 9 123
// Explanation: The elements are sorted in ascending order, then the duplicates are removed. The unique elements are: 0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123.

// Time Complexity: O(n log n) due to sorting, and O(n) for unique function. So, overall time complexity is O(n log n).
// Space Complexity: O(1) as no extra space is used. The space complexity of the algorithm is O(n) if the vector is resized.
// Here, n is the size of the vector.

// Note: This code assumes that the vector is passed by value. If the vector is passed by reference, the changes made in the function will be reflected in the original vector.

// Note: The unique function does not work with custom objects or user-defined data types. It only works with built-in data types.

// Note: The unique function does not work with associative containers like set or map. It only works with sequential containers like vector or list.

// Note: The unique function does not work with containers that do not have the < operator defined. It only works with containers that have the < operator
