The sort function sorts the vector in ascending order. 

B:
The unique function returns an iterator pointing to the new logical end of the range. It removes the duplicate elements by shifting the unique elements to the start of the range and returns an iterator pointing to the new logical end. 

C:
The function returns the sorted, unique vector.

//test
int main()
{
    vector<int> v = {5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123};
    vector<int> u = unique(v);
    for(int i: u)
        printf("%d ", i);

Output:
0 2 3 5 9 123

This code works by first sorting the vector and then removing duplicate elements. The result is a sorted vector with unique elements.

The unique function in C++ is a standard library function that removes consecutive duplicates in a range. It does not sort the range, so you have to sort it first. 

The unique function returns an iterator pointing to the new end of the range. It does not remove the elements, it only rearranges them. To remove the elements, you can use the erase function. 

The erase function takes two parameters: the beginning and the end of the range to remove. It removes the elements in the range [first, last) from the container. 

In this case, the unique function is used with two arguments: the begin and end of the vector. The returned iterator is passed to the erase function. The erase function removes the duplicate elements from the vector.
