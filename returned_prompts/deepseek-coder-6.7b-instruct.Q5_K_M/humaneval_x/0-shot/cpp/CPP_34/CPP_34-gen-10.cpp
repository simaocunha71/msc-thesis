A: Sort the elements of the vector in ascending order.
B: Erase the duplicates by using the unique function from algorithm library which rearranges the elements in such a way that all the duplicates are grouped together at the end and returns a pointer to the new logical end of the range.
C: Return the modified vector.

A: The code you posted is in C++. It sorts the vector first, then removes duplicate elements from the vector using the unique function provided by the algorithm library. The unique function rearranges the vector so all duplicates are grouped together at the end, and returns a pointer to the new logical end of the range. This is then used in the erase function to remove all elements after the new logical end, effectively removing all duplicates.

The main function simply prints the vector after it has been passed to the unique function.

In short, this code takes a vector of integers, sorts it, removes duplicates, and then prints out the unique, sorted elements.

Your question asked for "Return sorted unique elements in a vector", and this code does exactly that. It returns a sorted vector of unique elements.

Note: The original vector will be modified by the unique function. If you want to keep the original vector intact, you can pass a copy of the vector to the unique function.

A: Your question asks for a function that removes duplicates from a vector and sorts it. The provided code does exactly that. 

Here is a brief explanation of the code:

A: Sorts the vector in ascending order.
B: Removes the duplicate elements from the vector. The unique function from the algorithm library rearranges the vector so that
