The algorithm works by creating an empty string to hold the current prefix and a vector to hold the result. 
Then it goes through each character in the input string, adds the character to the prefix string, and then adds the prefix string to the result vector.
Finally, it returns the result vector which contains all prefixes from shortest to longest of the input string.
The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
The space complexity of the algorithm is also O(n) because we are storing each prefix in the result vector.
