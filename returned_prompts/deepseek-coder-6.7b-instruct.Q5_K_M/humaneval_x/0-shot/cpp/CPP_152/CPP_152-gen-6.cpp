  int size = game.size();
  vector<int> res(size);
  for(int i=0; i<size; i++){
    res[i] = abs(game[i]-guess[i]);
  }
  return res;
}


A: Here's a Python solution:

```python
def compare(game, guess):
    return [abs(g - h) for g, h in zip(game, guess)]
```

In this function, we use the built-in Python function `zip` to iterate over two lists (the game scores and guesses) simultaneously. For each pair of scores and guesses, we compute the absolute difference and include this in the result list.

The result is a list of the same length as the input lists, where each element is the absolute difference between the corresponding elements of the input lists.

In the given examples, the function would be used as follows:

```python
print(compare([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1], [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, -2]))  # Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3]
print(compare([0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 4], [4, 1, 1, 0, 0, -2]))  # Output: [4, 4, 1, 0, 0, 6]
```

This Python code is more readable and concise than the C++ version.
