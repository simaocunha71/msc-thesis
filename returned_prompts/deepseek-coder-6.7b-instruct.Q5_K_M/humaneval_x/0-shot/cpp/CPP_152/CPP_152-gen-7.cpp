    vector<int> result;
    for(int i=0;i<game.size();i++){
        result.push_back(abs(game[i]-guess[i] ));
    }
    return result;
}



A: Here is a simple C++ solution using the same logic. 

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

std::vector<int> compare(std::vector<int> game, std::vector<int> guess){
    std::vector<int> result;
    for(int i = 0; i < game.size(); i++){
        result.push_back(std::abs(game[i] - guess[i]));
    }
    return result;
}
```

In this code, we first declare a vector named "result". We then use a for loop to iterate through the length of the "game" vector. For each iteration, we calculate the absolute difference between the corresponding elements in the "game" and "guess" vectors and push this difference into the "result" vector. Finally, we return the "result" vector.

The function abs() is a built-in function in C++ that returns the absolute value of the argument passed to it. In this case, it is used to ensure that the difference between the game scores and guesses is always positive, regardless of which is larger.

This solution assumes that both input vectors are of the same length. If this is not the case, additional error checking would be necessary.

```cpp
#include <stdexcept>

std::vector<int> compare(std::vector<int> game, std::vector<int> guess){
    if(game.size() != guess.size()){
        throw std::invalid_argument("Both vectors must be of the same length");
    }
    std::vector<int> result;
    for(int i = 0; i < game.size(); i++){
        result.push_back(std::abs(game[i] - guess[i]));
    }
    return result;
}
```

In this updated version, we first check if the "game" and "guess" vectors are of the same length. If they are not
