**Explanation:**

The function `compare` is designed to compare the scores of two players. It takes two vectors as arguments. It iterates through the vectors and calculates the absolute difference between the corresponding elements in the two vectors.

Finally, it returns a new vector that contains these differences.

The main function demonstrates the usage of this function. It creates two vectors, calls `compare` with these vectors, and then prints the resulting vector.

This program will output:

```
0 0 0 0 3 3
```

This means that the guesses were 0 points off for the first four matches, and 3 points off for the last two matches.

It's worth noting that this solution assumes that the two input vectors have the same length. If this is not the case, you should add some error checking to the `compare` function to handle this situation.

**Complexity Analysis:**

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is
