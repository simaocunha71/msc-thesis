A: The question is not clear. It seems to ask for a function that takes two vectors (arrays) of integers and returns a vector of integers. It also seems to ask for the absolute difference between each corresponding pair of elements from the input vectors.

However, the C++ language does not support arrays (as you use the term) in the way that you might expect from other languages. C++ uses vectors instead. So, I assume you meant to use vectors.

Here's how you could solve the problem in C++ using vectors:

```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
#include<cmath>

std::vector<int> compare(std::vector<int> game, std::vector<int> guess){
    std::vector<int> result(game.size());
    for(int i=0; i<game.size(); i++){
        result[i] = abs(game[i]-guess[i]);
    }
    return result;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> game = {1,2,3,4,5,1};
    std::vector<int> guess = {1,2,3,4,2,-2};
    std::vector<int> result = compare(game, guess);

    for(int i=0; i<result.size(); i++){
        std::cout << result[i] << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This program defines a function compare that takes two vectors of integers and returns a vector of integers. It calculates the absolute difference between each corresponding pair of elements from the input vectors and stores these differences in the output vector. The main function tests the compare function with the vectors {1,2,3,4,5,1} and {1,2,3,4,2,-2} and prints the resulting vector.

Please clarify your question if this is not the solution you were looking for.
