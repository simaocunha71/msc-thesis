This is a simple cyclic encoding-decoding algorithm. The idea is to split the input string into groups of 3 characters and then cyclically shift the characters in each group.


A: The key to the encoding and decoding process is that you cycle the characters in each group. This is done by shifting the first character to the end of the group.

In the encode_cyclic function:

You split the string into groups of 3 characters. For each group, you shift the first character to the end. If the group has fewer than 3 characters, you leave it as it is. You then concatenate all the groups to form the encoded string.

In the decode_cyclic function:

You do the reverse of what you did in the encode_cyclic function. You split the encoded string into groups of 3 characters. For each group, you shift the last character to the start. If the group has fewer than 3 characters, you leave it as it is. You then concatenate all the groups to form the decoded string.

Here's the code for your main function:

```cpp
int main(){
    string s;
    printf("Enter string: ");
    getline(cin,s);
    string encoded=encode_cyclic(s);
    printf("Encoded: %s\n", encoded.
