Firstly, it checks if the size of the vector is less than 3 and returns false if so. Then, it sorts the vector.

B:
The outer loop iterates over each element in the vector. The inner two-pointer technique loop checks all pairs of elements to the right of the current element.

C:
The inner loop checks if the sum of the current three elements is zero. If it is, the function returns true. If the sum is less than zero, the left pointer (j) is incremented to increase the sum. If the sum is greater than zero, the right pointer (k) is decremented to decrease the sum.

If no three elements sum to zero are found, the function returns false.

The space complexity of the solution is O(1) since no additional space is used that scales with the input size. The time complexity is O(n^2) due to the nested loop structure.

In terms of the time complexity,
