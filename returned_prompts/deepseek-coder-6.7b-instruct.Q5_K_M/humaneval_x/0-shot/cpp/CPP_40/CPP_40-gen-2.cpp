The program works by first checking if there are at least three elements in the list. If there are not, it immediately returns false. 

Then, the program sorts the list in ascending order. This allows the program to use the two-pointer technique, which works by starting at the ends of the list and moving towards the center. 

After that, the program goes through each element in the list as the first element of the triplet. For each element, it uses two pointers, one at the position immediately after the current element, and one at the last element of the list. It then adds the current element, the element at the first pointer, and the element at the second pointer. 

If the sum of these three elements is 0, the function immediately returns true. If the sum is less than 0, the function moves the first pointer one position to the right. If the sum is greater than 0, the function moves the second pointer one position to the left. 

If the function goes through all the elements without finding a triplet that sums to 0, it returns false.

This algorithm works in O(n^2) time, where n is the number of elements in the list. The space complexity is O(1) as it only uses a constant amount of extra space.

It's worth noting that the program uses the C++ standard library function sort(), which sorts the elements
