In this program, we are calculating the power of 2 modulo p. We use binary exponentiation for this. The binary exponentiation method is used to calculate the power of a number in logarithmic time. The modulo operation is used to ensure that the result fits within the limit of p.

The function modp takes two parameters n and p. It calculates 2^n mod p. The result is stored in the variable res. The function then returns the value of res.

In the main function, we test our modp function with various inputs.

Note: The modp function uses integer division (/), which discards the remainder and only keeps the quotient. This is different from floating-point division (/), which keeps the remainder.
Also, the result of 2^n mod p is calculated in the modulo p space, so if the result is larger than p, it is reduced to the equivalent number in the modulo p space.

In conclusion, this program correctly calculates the power of 2 modulo p.

A: The function modp is used to calculate the remainder of a power of 2 when divided by a number p. The binary exponentiation method is used to calculate this power in logarithmic time.

Here is the detailed explanation of how it works:

- Initialize res as 1. This will be used to store the result.
- Enter a while loop that will continue until n is greater than 0.
- Inside the loop, check if n is odd (n % 2 == 1). If n is odd, multiply res by 2
