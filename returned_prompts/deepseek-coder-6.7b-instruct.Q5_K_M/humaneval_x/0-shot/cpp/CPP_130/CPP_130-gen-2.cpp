This code works by first initializing a vector with the first three values of the sequence (3, 2, and 8). If the input value of `n` is 0 or 1, the code will return the vector up to that point. If `n` is 2, the code will return the vector up to that point.

Then, if `n` is greater than 2, the code will go into a loop that runs `n-2` times. For each iteration, it checks if the current index `i` is even. If it is, the code calculates the next number in the sequence by adding the integer division of `i` by 2 to 1. If `i` is odd, the code calculates the next number in the sequence by adding the last three numbers in the sequence.

The calculated number is then added to the vector. Once the loop has finished running, the code returns the vector.

Note that the code assumes that the input value of `n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is negative, the code will return an empty vector.

Also, the code may not work correctly if the input value of `n` is very large because it uses recursion to calculate the numbers in the sequence. The recursion depth may be too large
