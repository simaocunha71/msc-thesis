The given C++ code is implementing the Tribonacci sequence by a recursive method. 

The initial conditions for the Tribonacci sequence are tri(1) = 3, tri(2) = 2, tri(3) = 8. 

The function tri(n) is defined as:

tri(1) = 3
tri(2) = 2
tri(3) = 8
tri(n) = tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n - 3), if n > 3

This function calculates the nth number in the sequence.

If the input n is less than or equal to 0, the function returns an empty vector. 

If n is 1, the function returns a vector with the single number 3. 

If n is 2, the function returns a vector with the first two numbers of the sequence: 3 and 2.

If n is 3, the function returns a vector with the first three numbers of the sequence: 3, 2, and 8.

If n is greater than 3, the function calculates the nth number in the sequence by summing the (n - 1)th, (n - 2)th, and (n - 3)th numbers. It then adds this sum to the vector, and returns the vector.

In the main function, we call tri(1
