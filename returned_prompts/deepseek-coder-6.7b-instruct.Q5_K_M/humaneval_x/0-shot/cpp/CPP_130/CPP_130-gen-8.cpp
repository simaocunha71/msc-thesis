This code defines a function `tri(n)` that calculates the first `n + 1` numbers of the Tribonacci sequence. The sequence is initialized with the first three numbers. Then it calculates each subsequent number in the sequence based on the provided recurrence relation. The function returns a vector containing the sequence.

In the `main()` function, the user is asked for a non-negative integer `n`. Then the `tri(n)` function is called with `n` as argument,
