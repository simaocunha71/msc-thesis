The given code has a problem. The function starts_one_ends calculates the count of the numbers of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1. But it doesn't consider the numbers that start with 1 and end with any digit except 1 and vice versa.

To fix this problem, we need to modify the function as follows:

```cpp
int starts_one_ends(int n){
    if(n <= 0)
        return 0;
    int count = 0;
    if(n == 1)
        return 1;
    for(int i = 1; i < n; i++){
        int temp = i * 8;
        if(i == 1)
            temp = 2; // 1 and 10 are the only two 2 digit numbers that start and end with 1
        count += temp;
    }
    return count + 2; // add 2 for 1 and n digit numbers
}
```

In this function, we consider the numbers that start with 1 and end with any digit except 1 and vice versa. For n = 1, the count is 1 (1). For n > 1, the count is the sum of the counts of n-1 digit numbers that start with 1 and end with any digit except 1 and vice versa, plus 2 (for 1 and n digit numbers).

Please note that the count of the numbers that start with 1 and end with any digit except 1 is (n-1) * 8, while the count of the numbers that start with any digit except 1 and end with
