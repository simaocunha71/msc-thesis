    int sum=0;
    for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++){
        if(isupper(s[i])){
            sum+=(int)s[i];
        }
    }
    return sum;
}

int main(){
    printf("%d",digitSum("abAB"));
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The function takes a string as input and initializes a variable `sum` to 0. This variable will be used to store the sum of the ASCII values of uppercase characters in the string.

- It then iterates over each character in the string using a for loop.

- Inside the loop, it uses the `isupper` function from the ctype.h library to check if the current character is an uppercase letter. If it is, the ASCII value of the character is added to `sum` using the `+=` operator.

- After all characters have been checked, the function returns `sum`.

- In the `main` function, it calls `digitSum` function with "abAB" string and prints the output.

**Note:** This code assumes that the string contains only alphabets. If the string might contain non-alphabetic characters, you should add additional error checking.

**Note:** The ASCII value of an uppercase character is the same as the ASCII value of its corresponding lowercase character plus 32. So, if you want to find the sum of the ASCII values of uppercase characters only, you can convert each uppercase character to a lowercase character before adding its ASCII value to `sum`.
