Answer:
The given problem can be solved in C++ using the concept of vectors. In the function f, a vector of size n is created and for each element at index i, if i is even, the element is set to the factorial of i, otherwise the element is set to the sum of numbers from 1 to i. The factorial of a number n is obtained by multiplying all the numbers from 1 to n. The sum of numbers from 1 to n can be obtained by the formula n*(n+1)/2. The function f returns the vector result. The main function then prints out the elements of the vector returned by the function f.

Test case:
Input: 5
Output: 1, 2, 6, 24, 15
Explanation:
At index 1, i = 1, so the element is 1 because 1*(1+1)/2 = 1.
At index 2, i = 2, so the element is 2 because 2*(2+1)/2 = 2.
At index 3, i = 3, so the element is 6 because 3*(3-1)*(3-2) = 6.
At index 4, i = 4, so the element is 24 because 4*(4-1)*(4-2)*(4-3) = 24.
At index 5, i = 5, so the element is 15 because 5*(5+1)/2 = 15.
