This program implements the function `f` as described in the problem. It first creates an empty vector `result`. Then it goes through the numbers from 1 to `n`, checking if each number is even or odd. If the number is even, it calculates the factorial of the number and adds it to `result`. If the number is odd, it calculates the sum of the numbers from 1 to the number and adds it to `result`. Finally, it returns `result`.

In the `main` function, it tests `f` with `n=5` and prints the result.

/*
The time complexity of this program is O(n^2) because of the two nested loops. 
The outer loop runs n times and for each iteration, the inner loop runs i times (where i is the current number). 
So the total number of iterations is the sum of the numbers from 1 to n, which is n*(n+1)/2. 
However, this is still O(n^2) because the number of operations in the inner loop is proportional to i, not n. 
So the time complexity is still O(n^2).

The space complexity is O(n) because we are storing the results in a vector of size n.

Note: The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to the number.
