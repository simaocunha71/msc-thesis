A: The code is almost correct, but you need to add a check if the input vector is empty. If it is, you should return the class name with an empty extension. Here is the corrected code:

```cpp
#include<stdio.h>
#include<vector>
#include<string>
using namespace std;

string Strongest_Extension(string class_name,vector<string> extensions){

    int max = -1000000;
    string max_name;
    if(extensions.empty()) return class_name + "."; // return class name with empty extension
    for(auto extension : extensions){
        int cap=0,sm=0;
        for(char c : extension){
            if(isupper(c)) cap++;
            if(islower(c)) sm++;
        }
        if(cap-sm>max){
            max = cap-sm;
            max_name = extension;
        }
    }
    return class_name + "." + max_name;
}
```

This code now correctly handles the case where the input vector is empty.

Also, note that the code assumes that the class name does not contain any uppercase letters, which is a valid assumption for the problem description. If the class name could contain uppercase letters, you would need to add a check to ensure that the class name and extension are compared in the same case (upper or lower).

I hope this helps, and let me know if you have any other questions.


A: Your code seems good, but I would suggest to handle the case if there are multiple extensions with the same strength. Right now, it will return the first one it
