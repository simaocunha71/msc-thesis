A: Here is a simple implementation in C++.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

string Strongest_Extension(string class_name, vector<string>& extensions) {
    int maxStrength = -99999; // initialize maxStrength as lowest possible integer
    string strongestExtension = "";
    
    // iterate over all extensions
    for (string extension : extensions) {
        int cap = 0, sm = 0;
        // calculate strength of the extension
        for (char c : extension) {
            if(isupper(c)) cap++;
            else if(islower(c)) sm++;
        }
        int strength = cap - sm;
        // if strength is greater than maxStrength, update maxStrength and strongestExtension
        if (strength > maxStrength) {
            maxStrength = strength;
            strongestExtension = extension;
        }
    }
    // return class_name + '.' + strongestExtension
    return class_name + '.' + strongestExtension;
}
```

This C++ function works by iterating over all extensions and calculating their strength as the difference between the count of uppercase letters and lowercase letters. If the calculated strength is greater than the current maximum strength, the function updates the maximum strength and the strongest extension. Finally, it returns the class name followed by the strongest extension in the format you specified.

For example, if you called `Strongest_Extension("my_class", {"AA", "Be", "CC"})`, the function would return `"my_class.AA"`.

This function assumes that the class name is valid and that the vector of extensions is not empty. If these assumptions do not hold, additional error checking should be added.

Also note that this function uses C++ Standard Library functions `isupper` and `islower`, which are part of the `<cctype>` library. Make sure to include this library at the beginning of your program.

```cpp
#include <cctype>
```

This should resolve the issue.

Happy Coding !
