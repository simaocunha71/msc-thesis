//Solution:

#include<stdio.h>
#include<vector>
#include<string>
using namespace std;

string Strongest_Extension(string class_name, vector<string> extensions){
    int max_strength = -256;
    string strongest_ext;
    for (string ext : extensions){
        int cap = 0, sm = 0;
        for (char c : ext){
            if (isupper(c)) cap++;
            if (islower(c)) sm++;
        }
        int strength = cap - sm;
        if (strength > max_strength){
            max_strength = strength;
            strongest_ext = ext;
        }
    }
    return class_name+"."+strongest_ext;
}

//Test Code:

#include<iostream>
int main(){
    vector<string> ext = {"AA", "Be", "CC"};
    cout<<Strongest_Extension("my_class", ext)<<endl;
    return 0;
}

//Output:
//my_class.AA

//The uppercase letters in "AA" make the strength 2, which is the highest value encountered.
//Hence, "AA" is chosen.
//The time complexity of this solution is O(N*M), where N is the number of extensions and M is the average length of the extensions.
//The space complexity is O(1), as no extra space is used.

//Note: The given problem statement doesn't provide the number of uppercase and lowercase letters.
//Hence, we assumed that the strength is given by the difference between the number of uppercase letters and lowercase letters in the extension's name.
//If the problem statement is different, the solution should be adapted accordingly.

//Also, we assumed that the input vector of extensions will always contain at least one element.
//If that's not the case, you need to add a check for this.

//This code has been tested and should work as expected.
//Let me know if you need any modifications or further clarification.

//Thanks for understanding.
