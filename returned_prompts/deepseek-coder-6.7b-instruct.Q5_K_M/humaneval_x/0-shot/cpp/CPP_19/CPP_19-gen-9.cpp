I'm trying to understand the code. It seems like it's using a map to map the string representation of numbers to their integer counterparts.

I'm not seeing where the map is being used in the actual sorting. Could someone please explain where the map is being used?

A: The map is being used to convert the string representations of numbers into their integer counterparts, so that they can be compared. The sort function in C++ does not know how to compare strings, so it can't sort them directly. By associating each string with an integer in the map, we tell the sort function how to compare the integers associated with the strings.

For example, if we have the strings "one" and "two", we can't directly say which one is smaller. But if we map "one" to 1 and "two" to 2, then we can say that 1 is smaller than 2. So, the sort function can use this information to sort the strings.

In the code, the lambda function in the sort
