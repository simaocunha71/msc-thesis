The program does not run correctly because the ASCII value of the character 'z' is 122 and 'a' is 97. When you add 5 to 'z' and get 127, you've gone over the ASCII range. You subtract 26 (the size of the alphabet) to wrap around to the start again, but you've gone too far. Instead of subtracting 26, you should subtract 5 to get back to 'z'. Here is the corrected code:

```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<string>
using namespace std;

string encode_shift(string s){
    string out;
    for(char &c : s)
    {
        int w=((int)c+5-(int)'a')%26+(int)'a';
        out+=(char)w;
    }
    return out;
}

string decode_shift(string s){
    string out;
    for(char &c : s)
    {
        int w=((int)c-5-(int)'a')%26+(int)'a';
        out+=(char)w;
    }
    return out;
}

int main() {
    string s = "hello";
    string encoded = encode_shift(s);
    string decoded = decode_shift(encoded);
    cout << "Original: " << s << "\nEncoded: " << encoded << "\nDecoded: " << decoded << "\n";
    return 0;
}
```

This program will correctly encode and decode a string "hello" by shifting each character 5 places in the alphabet.

Please note that this is a very simple substitution cipher and is not secure for encrypting sensitive information.

The original message is "hello", the encoded message is "mjqqt" and the decoded message is "hello".
```

I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.
