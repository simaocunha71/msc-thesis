The given solution is almost correct but there is a small error in the decoding function. The encoding function works correctly but the decoding function subtracts 5 instead of adding 5 to the ASCII value of the character. This difference is why the decoded string is not the original string.

Corrected version of the decoding function:

string decode_shift(string s){
    string out;
    int i;
    for  (i=0;i<s.length();i++)
    {
        int w=((int)s[i]-5-(int)'a'+26)%26+(int)'a';
        out=out+(char)w;
    }
    return out;
}

This corrected version of the decoding function should now correctly decode the encoded string back to its original form.

Note: This solution assumes that all characters in the input string are lowercase alphabet letters and no other characters are present. If there could be uppercase letters or other characters, additional error checking would be needed.
