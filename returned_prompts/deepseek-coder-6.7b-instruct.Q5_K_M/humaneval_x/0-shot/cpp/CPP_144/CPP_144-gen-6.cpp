This code takes advantage of the fact that converting a fraction to a decimal value is a simple mathematical operation. It then checks if the product of the decimal values is a whole number by casting the product to an integer and comparing it to the original product. This approach will work correctly because of the properties of whole numbers and decimals.

This code is written in C++ and uses the stringstream library to parse the fractions into their numerator and denominator. It then converts these values to decimals and multiplies them together. The result is then cast to an integer and compared to the original product to determine if it is a whole number.
