A: This is a simple task to solve with some basic arithmetic. You just have to multiply the numerators and denominators of the fractions. If the product of the numerators is divisible by the product of the denominators, the original fractions are equivalent and the result should be true. If not, the result should be false.

Here is a simple implementation in Python:

def simplify(x, n):
    x_num, x_den = map(int, x.split('/'))
    n_num, n_den = map(int, n.split('/'))
    return x_num * n_den % x_den * n_num == 0

print(simplify("1/5", "5/1"))  # True
print(simplify("1/6", "2/1"))  # False
print(simplify("7/10", "10/2"))  # False

This function works by splitting the fractions into their numerator and denominator parts, converting them to integers, and then using the modulus operator to check if the product of the numerators is divisible by the product of the denominators. The function returns True if the fractions are equivalent, and False otherwise.

Please note that this solution assumes that the input strings are always valid and follow the specified format.

Note that the 'C' version of the code you provided is not correct because it does not return a boolean value. The function should return a boolean value (true or false) not an integer (1 or 0).
