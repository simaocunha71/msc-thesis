The given program takes an array of integers as input. Then it iterates over the array and for each number, if the number is negative, the absolute value of the number is taken and the digits are summed up with negative signs. If the number is positive, the digits are summed up normally. If the sum is greater than 0, count is incremented. Finally count is returned as the result.

The output of the program will be 1, as there is only one number in the array whose sum of digits is greater than 0.

Test case 2:
n.push_back(1);
n.push_back(1);
n.push_back(2);
The output of the program will be 3, as all the numbers in the array have sum of digits greater than 0.

Test case 3:
n.push_back(123);
n.push_back(456);
n.push_back(789);
The output of the program will be 0, as none of the numbers in the array have sum of digits greater than 0.

Test case 4:
n.push_back(-123);
n
