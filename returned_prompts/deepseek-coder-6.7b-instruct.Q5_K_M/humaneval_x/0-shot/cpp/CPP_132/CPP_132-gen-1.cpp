In the given code, we are using a stack data structure to solve the problem. First, we iterate through the string and for each opening bracket, we push it into the stack. When we encounter a closing bracket, we pop an element from the stack. If the stack becomes empty before we encounter a closing bracket, we return false as this means the brackets are not properly nested. If we encounter a closing bracket before the stack becomes empty, we increment a counter. If the counter is greater than 0 at the end of the iteration, we return true as this means there is at least one valid subsequence of brackets that is nested. Otherwise, we return false.

The time complexity of the code is O(n) where n is the length of the string. The space complexity is O(1) as we are not using any extra space that scales with the size of the input.

Note: This solution assumes that the input string only contains square brackets. If there are other characters in the string, the function might not work correctly.
Also, the function does not handle unbalanced brackets, it returns false if there are more closing brackets than opening ones.
