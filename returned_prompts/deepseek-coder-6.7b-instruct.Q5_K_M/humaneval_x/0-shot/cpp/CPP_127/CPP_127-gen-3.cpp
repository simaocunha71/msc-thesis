This problem is about finding the intersection of two given intervals and then checking if the length of that intersection is a prime number. The algorithm for finding the intersection of two intervals is straightforward: the start of the intersection is the maximum of the starts of the two intervals, and the end of the intersection is the minimum of the ends of the two intervals. If the start of the intersection is greater than the end, then the intervals do not intersect. The length of the intersection is the end minus the start plus 1. If the length is less than 2, then it is not a prime number and we return "NO". Otherwise, we check if the length is a prime number by trying to divide it by all numbers up to its square root. If it is divisible by any of these numbers, then it is not a prime number and we return "NO". Otherwise, it is a prime number and we return "YES".
