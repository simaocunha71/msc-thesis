In this step, I've computed the start and end of the intersection by taking the max and min of the start and end of the two intervals.

B:
In this step, I've checked if the start of the intersection is larger than the end. This means that the two intervals don't intersect and I return "NO".

C:
In this step, I've looped through all possible factors of the length of the intersection (from 2 to sqrt(length)) and checked if the length is divisible by any of them. If it is, the length of the intersection is not a prime number and I return "NO". If the length is not divisible by any of them, the length of the intersection is a prime number and I return "YES".
