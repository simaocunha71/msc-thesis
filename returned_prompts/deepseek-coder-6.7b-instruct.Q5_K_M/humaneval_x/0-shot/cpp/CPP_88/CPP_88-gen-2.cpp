The algorithm to solve the problem is as follows:

Firstly, we need to check if the size of the vector is zero. If it is, we return the vector as it is since there's nothing to sort.

Secondly, we calculate the sum of the first and last elements in the vector. This sum will help us decide whether we should sort the vector in ascending order (if the sum is odd) or descending order (if the sum is even).

Finally, we create a copy of the original vector and sort it. If the sum is even, we sort the vector in descending order, otherwise in ascending order.

B:
We use the sort function from the algorithm library to sort the vector. If the sum is even, we pass greater<int>() as a comparison function to sort the vector in descending order, otherwise we just pass less<int>().

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n log n), where n is the size of the vector. This is because we use the sort function which has a time complexity of O(n log n). The space complexity is also O(n) because we create a copy of the original vector.

The algorithm is correct because it correctly sorts the vector based on the sum of the first and last elements, and it does this without modifying the original vector.
