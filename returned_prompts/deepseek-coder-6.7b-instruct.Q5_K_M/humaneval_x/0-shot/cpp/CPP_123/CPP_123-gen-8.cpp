/*
Explanation:
    In this code, we are first checking if the current number is odd. If it is, we push it into the vector. Then, we generate the next number in the sequence. If the current number is even, we divide it by 2. If it's odd, we multiply it by 3 and add 1. We repeat this process until we reach 1. Finally, we sort the vector and return it.

## Submission

Submit the code you wrote in the code section to the platform.

## Answer

The code you wrote is correct and it will work as per the problem statement. This code generates the Collatz sequence for a given number n and returns a sorted vector of odd numbers in the sequence.

## Next Steps

You can now test this function with different inputs to see its behavior. You can also use this function in your programming projects.
