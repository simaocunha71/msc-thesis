This program reads an integer `n` from the standard input and then prints the odd numbers in the Collatz sequence for `n`, sorted in increasing order. The Collatz sequence is computed by the function `get_odd_collatz`.

This program is written in C++ and uses the standard library to handle the vector data structure and the sorting algorithm. The `get_odd_collatz` function generates the Collatz sequence for `n`, checks each term to see if it is odd, and if it is, adds it to the `odds` vector. The `sort` function is used to sort the `odds` vector in increasing order. The `odds` vector is then returned.

The main function reads an integer `n` from the standard input, calls `get_odd_collatz` with `n` as the argument, and then prints the elements of the returned vector.

The time complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the starting number for the Collatz sequence. This is because the program generates the Collatz sequence for `n` and checks each term to see if it is odd. The space complexity is also O(n), where n is the number of odd numbers in the Collatz sequence. This is because the program stores the odd numbers in a vector.

This program should work for any positive integer input. However, it is important to note that the Collatz conjecture is still an open problem in mathematics. Therefore, this program should be used as a theoretical tool for understanding the Col
