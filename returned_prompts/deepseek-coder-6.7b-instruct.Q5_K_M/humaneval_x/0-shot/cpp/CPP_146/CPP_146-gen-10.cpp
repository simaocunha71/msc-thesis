Here, we have a function called specialFilter which takes a vector of integers as input. We initialize a counter variable count to 0. Then we loop through each number in the vector. If the number is greater than 10, we calculate the first digit and the last digit of the number using integer division and modulus operations. If both the first and last digits are odd (when we check if the remainder of dividing by 2 is 1), we increment the count. Finally, we return the count.

The main function simply tests the specialFilter function with a vector of integers.

This code will return 2, which is the number of elements in the vector that are greater than 10 and both first and last digits of a number are odd.

//Test cases

//vector<int> nums = {15, -73, 14, -15};
//Output: 1

//vector<int> nums = {33, -2, -3, 45, 21, 109};
//Output: 2

//vector<int> nums = {9, 111, 2, 44, 10, 1, 1000};
//Output: 3

//vector<int> nums = {-1, -10, 100, 101, 11, 1000, -100};
//Output: 2
