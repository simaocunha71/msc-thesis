The question seems to ask for a function that counts the numbers in a vector that are greater than 10 and have both their first and last digit as odd numbers. The function specialFilter takes a vector of integers as input and returns an integer which is the count of such numbers.

The function iterates through all the elements of the vector. It checks if the absolute value of the current number is greater than 10, and if it is, it gets the first and last digit of the number by dividing and taking modulus with 10 respectively. Then, it checks if the first and last digits are odd (by checking if they are not divisible by 2). If both conditions are met, it increments the count. Finally, it returns the count.

The main function tests the specialFilter function with two vectors. It prints the count of numbers that satisfy the conditions for each vector.

Please note that the first digit of a number can be negative if it is a negative number, so we take the absolute value of the number to correctly get the first digit.

Also, please note that the last digit of a number is the remainder of the number when divided by 10, so we use the modulus operator (%) to get the last digit.

This C++ code should work as expected.
