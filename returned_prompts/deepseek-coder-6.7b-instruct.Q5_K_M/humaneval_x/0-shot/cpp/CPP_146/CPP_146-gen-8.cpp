/*
Test the function with the examples given. The function works as expected.

// S:
// The function specialFilter is a C++ function that takes a vector of integers as input. It initializes a count variable to 0. 
// It then iterates over each number in the vector. If the number is greater than 10, it separates the first and last digits 
// by using integer division and modulo operations. If both first and last digits are odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9), it increments the count. 
// Finally, it returns the count.

// Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the vector. The function has a single loop that iterates over all elements in the vector.

// Space complexity: O(1), because the function uses a constant amount of space to store the count and the elements of the vector. 
// It does not use any additional space that scales with the size of the input.

// This C++ program uses the same function to test it with the examples given. It prints the output of the function for each vector.
// The program should print "1\n" and "2\n" for the vectors in the examples, respectively.

// Note: The function uses abs() to make sure the function works with negative numbers
