The above program is written in C++ and uses the standard library. The program will parse through the string and keep track of the maximum depth of parentheses. It does this by using a counter to keep track of the current depth and a max_counter to keep track of the maximum depth. The levels of nesting are stored in a vector.

This program has three parts:

- Part A initialises the variables and the vector that will store the results.
- Part B goes through each character in the string, incrementing the counter when it encounters an opening parenthesis and decrementing the counter when it encounters a closing parenthesis. It then checks if the counter is greater than max_counter, and if so, updates max_counter.
- Part C returns the vector of results.

The main function simply calls the parse_nested_parens function with the string to be parsed and prints out the results.

Note: This program assumes that the input string is correctly formatted and does not contain any characters other than parentheses and spaces. If this is not the case, additional error checking will need to be added.

Also, this solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because it traverses the string once.

This solution does not handle multiple groups of parentheses in the string. If you need to handle multiple groups, you would need to add additional code to split the string into groups and process each one separately.
