Answer:
This program checks if the given vector is sorted in ascending order. It does this by iterating over the vector and checking if each element is less than the previous one. If it finds one that is not, it returns false, indicating the vector is not sorted. If it goes through the entire vector without finding any such element, it returns true, indicating the vector is sorted.

The time complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the length of the vector. This is because it iterates through the vector once. The space complexity is O(1), because it uses a constant amount of space to store the vector and the loop variable.

This program assumes that the input vector will only contain positive integers, and that there will be no negative numbers or other non-integer values. It also assumes that the input vector will not contain more than one duplicate of the same number.

The function `is_sorted` is a boolean function that returns true if the vector is sorted in ascending order, and false otherwise.

In the `main` function, it creates a vector of integers and then calls the `is_sorted` function with the vector as its argument. The result is printed to the console.

Please note that the `is_sorted` function should be used with caution, as it only checks if the vector is sorted in ascending order. If the vector is sorted in descending order, the function will return true, which may not be what you want.

It's also worth mentioning that this program assumes that the input vector will not contain negative numbers. If there is a chance of negative numbers appearing in the vector, you would need to modify the function to handle that case.

Overall, this program is a simple yet effective way to check if a vector is sorted in ascending order.
