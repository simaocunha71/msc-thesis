A: You need to create a function which takes in a vector of integers and returns a vector of integers with all elements incremented by 1.

Here is an example of how you can do this in C++:

```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
using namespace std;

vector<int> incr_vector(vector<int> v) {
    for (int i=0; i<v.size(); i++) {
        v[i] += 1;
    }
    return v;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3};
    v = incr_vector(v);
    for (int i=0; i<v.size(); i++) {
        cout << v[i] << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In this code, we first include the necessary libraries. The "incr_vector" function iterates over the vector and increments each element by 1. The "main" function then calls this function and prints the resulting vector.

Please note that in C++, it's more idiomatic to use `std::vector` instead of `std::list` for this type of task. The size of the vector is usually known in advance, so a `std::vector` is more efficient than a `std::list`.

Also, it's good practice to use `std::vector` and `std::cout` instead of `printf` and `printf` respectively, as they are more modern and safer.

Finally, you should consider using modern C++ features like auto and range-based for loops to make your code more readable and concise.
