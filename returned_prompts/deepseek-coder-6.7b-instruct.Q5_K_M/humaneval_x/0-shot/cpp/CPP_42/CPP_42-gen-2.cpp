The given code is written in C++. It increases each element of the vector by 1 and returns the updated vector. 

If you're trying to run this in Python, you should modify the code as follows:

```python
def incr_list(l):
    return [x+1 for x in l]

print(incr_list([1, 2, 3]))
print(incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]))
```

This will output:

```
[2, 3, 4]
[6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]
```

which are the results of incrementing each element of the input lists by 1.

Please, let me know if you meant something different.
