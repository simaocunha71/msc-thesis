A: 
Return maximum element in the vector.
>>> max_element({1, 2, 3})
3
>>> max_element({5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10})
123
*/

Your code is correct and will return the maximum element in the vector. It uses a simple loop to traverse the vector and keep track of the maximum value it has seen so far. The maximum value is initialized to negative infinity, so any real number in the vector will be larger than -infinity.

A: You are correct. The code works as expected and it is a good solution for the problem. It only takes a single pass through the vector, so its time complexity is O(n), where n is the size of the vector. This is the best time complexity you can achieve for this problem because you have to look at each element at least once.

In terms of space complexity, the code is also efficient. It only uses a single variable to keep track of the maximum value, so its space complexity is O(1), which means it uses the same amount of space regardless of the size of the vector.

Overall, this is a very efficient solution to the problem.

Just for the sake of completeness, here is the solution in C++:

```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
#include<algorithm>

float max_element(std::vector<float> l){
    if (l.empty()) {
        throw std::invalid_argument("Vector is empty");
    }
    return *std::max_element(l.begin(), l.end
