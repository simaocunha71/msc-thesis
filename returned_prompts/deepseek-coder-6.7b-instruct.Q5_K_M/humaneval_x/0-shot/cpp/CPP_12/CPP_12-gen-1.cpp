  if(strings.empty()) return NULL;

This line of code checks if the vector strings is empty and returns NULL if true.

B:
  string longest = strings[0];
  int maxLen = longest.length();

This block of code initializes the variable longest to the first string in the vector strings and the variable maxLen to the length of this first string.

C:
  for(int i = 1; i < strings.size(); i++){
    if(strings[i].length() > maxLen){
      maxLen = strings[i].length();
      longest = strings[i];
    }
  }

This loop goes through each string in the vector strings. If the length of the string is greater than maxLen, it updates maxLen and longest.

D:
  return longest;

Finally, this line of code returns the longest string.

The time complexity of this code is O(n) because it goes through each string in the vector once. The space complexity is O(1) because it uses a constant amount of space to store the longest string and its length.
