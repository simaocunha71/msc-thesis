Here is a C++ solution for the problem. This solution works by checking each character of the second string against each character of the first string. If a match is found, it creates all possible rotations of the second string and checks if any of these rotations can be found in the first string.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) where n is the length of the second string. This is because for each character in the second string, we are checking if it can be found in the first string, which is a linear operation. The space complexity is O(n) due to the creation of temporary strings in the process of checking rotations.

In the main function, I have called the cycpattern_check function with different pairs of strings. The result is printed as 1 (for true) and 0 (for false).

Please note that the cycpattern_check function is case sensitive. If you want to make it case insensitive, you can convert both strings to lower or upper case before processing.
