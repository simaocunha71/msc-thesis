The given C++ code is actually checking whether the number of prime factors of the given number is 3 or not. If the number of prime factors is 3, the function will return true. Otherwise, it will return false.

To explain the function:
- The for loop runs from 2 to the given number (inclusive). 
- The while loop checks if the number is divisible by the current number 'i'. If it is, then 'i' is a prime factor of the number.
- The number of prime factors is incremented by 1.
- After all the numbers are checked, the function will return true if the number of prime factors is 3, and false otherwise.

In the main function, the user is prompted to enter a number. The function is_multiply_prime is then called with the entered number as argument. If the function returns true, it means that the number is a multiplication of 3 prime numbers, otherwise it is not. The result is then printed.

The code has a time complexity of O(n) as the while loop runs for every number from 2 to n. The space complexity is O(1) as no extra space is used.

The function can be further optimized by checking only up to sqrt(n) because a larger factor of n must be a multiple of a smaller factor that has already been checked. However, in this case, the numbers to check are small so the code will work fine.

Also, the function does not check for composite numbers. It only checks prime numbers. So, for composite numbers, the function will return false
