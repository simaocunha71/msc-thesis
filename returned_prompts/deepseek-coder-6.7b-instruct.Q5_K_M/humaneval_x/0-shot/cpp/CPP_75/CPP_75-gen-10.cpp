The function first creates an array of prime numbers less than 50. Then it loops through the array and checks if the given number can be divided by the current prime number. If yes, it counts how many times the number can be divided. After the loop, it checks if the count is 3 or more, which means the given number can be multiplied by 3 primes. If the count is 3 or more, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.
