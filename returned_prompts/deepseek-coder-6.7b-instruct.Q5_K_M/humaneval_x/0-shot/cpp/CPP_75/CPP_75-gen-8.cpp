The code checks whether a number is a product of exactly three different prime factors. It uses a loop to divide the given number by each potential factor starting from 2. If the number is divisible by the factor, it counts this factor and continues to divide the number by the factor until it is no longer possible. The loop continues to the next potential factor. If the count of different prime factors is exactly 3, the function returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

The function is_multiply_prime(int a) is the main function that returns true if the number 'a' is a product of exactly three different prime factors and false otherwise.

The main function prompts the user to enter a number. It then uses the function is_multiply_prime() to check if the number is a product of exactly three different prime factors and prints the result.

//Test cases
/*
is_multiply_prime(30) should return true
is_multiply_prime(42) should return true
is_multiply_prime(84) should return true
is_multiply_prime(100) should return false
