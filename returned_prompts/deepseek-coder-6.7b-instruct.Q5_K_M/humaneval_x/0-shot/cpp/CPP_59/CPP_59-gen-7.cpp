The code is a simple implementation of the prime factorization algorithm. It starts from 2 and keeps dividing the input number by the same number until it's no longer divisible. Then it increments the number and repeats the process until it finds a prime number that is a factor of the input. This prime number will be the largest prime factor.

The code is written in C++. The question was written in Python, but the code is written in C++ as per the language of the question.

Please note that the code is not the most efficient way to find the largest prime factor of a number. It's just a simple implementation.

Also, the code does not check if the number is a prime number. If the number is a prime number, the function will return the number itself. So, please make sure that the number is not a prime number.

Also, the code does not check if the input number is greater than 1 and is not a prime number. If the input number is not a composite number, the function will return the number itself. So, please make sure that the number is greater than 1 and is not a prime number.

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int num;
    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> num;
    cout << "Largest prime factor of " << num << " is " << largest_prime_factor(num) << endl;
    return 0;
}


The code will prompt the user to enter a number, then it will output the largest prime factor of the entered number.

This code will work
