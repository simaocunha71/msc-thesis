The task is to insert a given delimiter between each pair of consecutive elements in a vector of integers. The solution provided is a C++ function that does this task.

The function `intersperse` takes two parameters: a vector of integers `numbers` and an integer `delimeter`. It creates a new vector `result` and iterates over the `numbers` vector. For each element, it adds the element and the delimiter to the `result` vector. If the element is the last one in the `numbers` vector, it only adds the element to the `result` vector without adding the delimiter. Finally, it returns the `result` vector.

Here is the function in action with an example:

```cpp
int main() {
    vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3};
    int delimeter = 4;
    vector<int> result = intersperse(numbers, delimeter);
    for(int i = 0; i < result.size(); i++){
        printf("%d ", result[i]);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This will output: `1 4 2 4 3`

In this example, the `numbers` vector is `{1, 2, 3}` and the `delimeter` is `4`. The function `intersperse` returns a new vector with the delimeter inserted between each pair of consecutive elements. The `main` function then prints the elements of the resulting vector.
