A: The given C++ code correctly implements the function to filter out the negative numbers from a given list. This is a simple implementation of the filter function in C++.

Here's how it works:

- It defines a function get_positive that takes a vector of floats as its argument.

- Inside this function, it declares a new vector named positive to store the positive numbers.

- Then, it uses a for-each loop to iterate over each number in the input vector.

- Inside the loop, it checks if the current number is greater than 0.

- If the number is greater than 0, it uses the push_back function to add this number to the positive vector.

- Finally, it returns the positive vector.

- In the main function, it creates a vector of floats, calls the get_positive function with this vector as an argument, and stores the result in a new vector named positive.

- Then, it uses another for-each loop to print each number in the positive vector.

This code prints the positive numbers in the input vector, separated by spaces.

This code uses C++11 and later versions, so you need to compile it with a C++11 compatible compiler (g++, clang++, etc.) to use the auto keyword and range-based for loops.

In case you want to use C++98 syntax, you should replace the range-based for loop with a traditional for loop, and use the .size() method to get the size of the vector:

```cpp
for(unsigned int i = 0; i < l.size(); i++) {
    if(l[i] > 0)
