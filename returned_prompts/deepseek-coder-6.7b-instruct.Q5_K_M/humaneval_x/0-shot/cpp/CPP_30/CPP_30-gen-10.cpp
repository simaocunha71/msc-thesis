This program starts by initializing an empty vector named "pos_num". It then loops through each element in the input vector. If the element is greater than 0, it is pushed back into the "pos_num" vector. Finally, the "pos_num" vector is returned.

The main function tests this by initializing a vector of floats named "nums" with some negative and positive numbers. It then calls the function "get_positive" with "nums" as the argument and assigns the returned vector to "pos_nums". Finally, it iterates through the "pos_nums" vector and prints each element.

Note that the function signature in the Q is incorrect. It should be vector<int> get_positive(vector<int> l) since the input is a vector of integers.

In the main function, it's also better to use printf to print the numbers since it's more straightforward. The for loop in the main function can be replaced with the following:

for(int num : pos_nums){
    printf("%f ", num);
}
