A: The function `common()` sorts the input vectors and then uses `set_intersection()` to find the common elements. The result is then sorted and duplicates are removed.

The function `set_intersection()` requires the range of elements to be sorted, so `sort()` is used before it. The result vector `c` is then sorted again with `sort()` to ensure it is sorted.

The `erase()` function with `unique()` is used to remove any duplicates from the vector. The `unique()` function returns an iterator pointing to the new logical end of the range, while `erase()` removes the elements after this point.

In the main function, the `common()` function is called with two vectors as arguments, and the result is printed to the standard output.

The `printf("%d ", i);` line is used to print each element of the result vector, separated by a space.

The `return 0;` line signifies that the program has finished successfully.

This code uses the C++ Standard Library functions `sort()`, `set_intersection()`, `unique()`, and `erase()`. It also uses a vector to store the elements.

The complexity of this algorithm is
