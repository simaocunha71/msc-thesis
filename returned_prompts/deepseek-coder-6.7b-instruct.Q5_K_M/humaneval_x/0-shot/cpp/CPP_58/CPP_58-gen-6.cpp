This program finds the common elements from two vectors by first sorting them. Then it iterates through both vectors simultaneously, comparing each element of the first vector with the corresponding element of the second vector. When the elements match, it adds the common element to a new vector. The new vector is then sorted and duplicate elements are removed.

This program uses the STL algorithm functions sort() and unique() to sort the common elements and remove the duplicate ones, respectively. The sort() function sorts the elements of the vector in ascending order, and the unique() function removes the duplicate elements from the sorted vector.

The time complexity of this program is O(n log n) due to the sorting of the vectors. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the common elements in the new vector.

Note that this code assumes that the input vectors do not contain any duplicate elements. If there are duplicate elements in the vectors, you may need to remove them before finding the common elements.

This program can be modified to handle vectors with duplicate elements by removing the lines that remove duplicate elements from the sorted vector. The
