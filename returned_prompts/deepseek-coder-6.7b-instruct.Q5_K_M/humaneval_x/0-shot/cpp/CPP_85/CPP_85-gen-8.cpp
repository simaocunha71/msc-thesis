A: The problem you've specified seems to be a task from codewars or similar platform. The description states that you need to add the even elements that are at odd indices. 

In this case, you can use the modulus operator to determine if an index is odd or even. If the index is odd (i % 2 == 1), then the element at that index is odd. If the element is even (i % 2 == 0), then it is at an odd index.

Therefore, the algorithm should look like this:

1. Initialize a variable sum to 0. This will store the sum of the even elements at odd indices.
2. Loop over the list, but only consider odd indices (i % 2 == 1).
3. For each element at an odd index, check if it is even (element % 2 == 0).
4. If the element is even, add it to sum.
5. After the loop, return sum.

This solution is implemented in the code you provided. The add function takes a vector of integers and returns the sum of the even elements at odd indices. The main function tests this function with the vector {4, 2, 6, 7}. The result is printed to the console.
