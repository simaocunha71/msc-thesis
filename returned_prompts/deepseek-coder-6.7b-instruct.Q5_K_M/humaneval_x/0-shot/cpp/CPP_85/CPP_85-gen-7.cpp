A: The problem you're describing is a common one in coding interviews, and it's called "Adding Elements at Odd Indices". The solution provided is correct. It adds the even numbers at odd indices.

The for loop iterates over the vector. The condition "i%2 == 0 && lst[i]%2 == 0" checks if the index is even and the number at that index is even. If both conditions are met, the number is added to the sum.

The result is the sum of the even numbers at odd indices. In your example, the numbers at odd indices (2, 6, 7) are all even, so the sum is 2 + 6 + 7 = 15.

So the output of the program is 15.

I hope this explanation helps you understand how the solution works.

Note: In C++, indices start at 0, so indices 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. are all even numbers. The numbers at odd indices are the numbers at even positions in the list, i.e., 2, 6, 7 are at the odd indices (1, 3, 4).

Remember that this solution assumes that the indices in the problem start at 1. If the indices start at 0, you should change the condition to "i%2 == 1 && lst[i]%2 == 1" instead.

I hope this helps you understand how the solution works. Let me know if you have any other questions.
