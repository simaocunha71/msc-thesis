A: The task is to add the even elements that are at odd indices of an array. The indices in this case are 0-based, so the 1st element is at index 0, 2nd element is at index 1, 3rd element is at index 2 and so on. 

In the given example, the numbers at odd indices are 2 (at index 1), 6 (at index 3) and the sum of these numbers is 8.

Therefore, the solution is 8.

In the C++ code, you are iterating through the vector and checking if the index is odd (i%2==1) and the number at that index is even (lst[i]%2==0). If both conditions are true, you add the number to the sum. At the end, you return the sum.

In the main function, you are calling the add function with a vector of integers as an argument and printing the result.

The code is correct and will work as expected.

Here is the correct C++ code:

```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
using namespace std;
int add(vector<int> lst){
    int sum = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < lst.size(); i++){
        if(i%2 == 1 && lst[i]%2 == 0)
            sum += lst[i];
    }
    return sum;
}
int main(){
    vector<int> vec = {4, 2, 6, 7};
    cout << add(vec);
    return 0;
}
```

This code will output: 8

This is because the even numbers at odd indices in
