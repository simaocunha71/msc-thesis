// This code sorts the numbers in ascending order and then checks if any two consecutive
// numbers have a difference less than the given threshold. If such pair is found, the function
// returns true. If no such pair is found after checking all elements, the function returns false.
// It uses the STL sort function to sort the vector and the abs function from the math library
// to get the absolute value of a number.
// It is written in C++.
// The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n log n) because of the sorting step, and the
// space complexity is O(1) because it uses a constant amount of extra space.
// The code is correct and will work as expected.
// It is a simple and efficient solution to the problem.

// This code is a solution to the problem. It uses the STL sort function to sort the vector of
// numbers in ascending order. Then it iterates through the vector and checks if any two
// consecutive numbers have a difference less than the given threshold. If such pair is found,
// the function returns true. If no such pair is found after checking all elements, the function
// returns false
