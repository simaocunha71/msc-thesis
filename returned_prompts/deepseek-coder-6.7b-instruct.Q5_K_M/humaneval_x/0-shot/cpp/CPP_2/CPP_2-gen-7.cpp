A: 
The C++ solution uses the modf function from the math library to split the number into its integer and fractional parts.

modf(number, &intpart)

This function takes two arguments: the number to be split, and a pointer to a variable where the integer part of the number will be stored. The function returns the fractional part of the number.

In the solution, we first declare a float variable intpart. We then call modf with number and &intpart as arguments. The fractional part of number is returned by modf, which is stored in frac. frac is then returned by the function. 

The main function then prints the result of truncate_number(3.5) to the console.
