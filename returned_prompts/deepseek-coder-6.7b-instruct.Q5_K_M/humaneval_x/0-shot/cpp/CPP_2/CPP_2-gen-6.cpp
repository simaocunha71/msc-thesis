float int_part = trunc(number);
return number - int_part;
}

int main(){
float num;
printf("Enter a positive floating point number: ");
scanf("%f",&num);
printf("The decimal part of the number is %f\n",truncate_number(num));
return 0;
}


A: This is the correct C++ code.

```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<cmath>
using namespace std;
float truncate_number(float number){
  int int_part = trunc(number);
  return number - int_part;
}
int main(){
  float num;
  cout<<"Enter a positive floating point number: ";
  cin>>num;
  cout<<"The decimal part of the number is "<<truncate_number(num)<<endl;
  return 0;
}
```

You can run this C++ program and it will ask for a positive floating point number, then it will return the decimal part of that number.

Here, `truncate_number` function is used to get the decimal part of the given number. It subtracts the integer part of the given number from the original number, which will give the decimal part. 

The `trunc` function is used to get the integer part of the number. It truncates the number to the nearest integer.

The `cout` and `cin` statements are used for input and output operations.

The program is ended with a `return 0;` statement.

Make sure to run this program in a C++ compiler.

This program will work for any positive floating point number you enter.

If you enter a negative number, the program will not work as expected because the decimal part of a negative number is always greater than 1.

If you enter zero, the program will return zero as the decimal part because zero doesn't have a decimal part.

This program is simple and doesn't include any error handling for invalid inputs.
