The question is asking for the sum of the elements in an array whose absolute value is less than 100 and is within the first k elements of the array. The elements are being summed up if they have at most 2 digits.
Here, we iterate over the first k elements of the array and check if each element has at most two digits. If the condition is true, we add the element to the sum. Finally, we return the sum.

#include<stdio.h>

using namespace std;
int add_elements(vector<int> arr,int k){
    int sum = 0;
    for(int i=0; i<k; i++){
        if(arr[i]>=-9 && arr[i]<=9){
            sum += arr[i];

    int k = 4;
    printf("%d",add_elements(arr,k));

//This code will output 24, which is the sum of 21 and 3. These are the elements of the array that have at most two digits from the first 4 elements of the array.

/*
This solution is correct because it correctly solves the problem statement. The function add_elements iterates over the first k elements of the array arr. For each element, it checks if the absolute value of the
