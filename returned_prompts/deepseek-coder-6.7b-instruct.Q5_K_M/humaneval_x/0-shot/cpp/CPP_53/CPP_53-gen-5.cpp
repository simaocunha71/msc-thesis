    return x+y;
}

int main(){
    int x,y;
    printf("Enter the first number: ");
    scanf("%d",&x);
    printf("Enter the second number: ");
    scanf("%d",&y);
    printf("Sum of the entered numbers: %d\n",add(x,y));
    return 0;
}

I have tested this code in Code::Blocks and it works fine.
It takes two numbers as input from the user and displays the sum of these numbers by calling the function "add".

A: The code you have is in C language not C++. In C++, the keyword "using namespace std" should be the first line in your program.
Here is the correct C++ version of the code:

```c++
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int add(int x, int y){
    return x+y;
}

int main(){
    int x, y;
    cout<<"Enter the first number: ";
    cin>>x;
    cout<<"Enter the second number: ";
    cin>>y;
    cout<<"Sum of the entered numbers: "<<add(x,y)<<endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In the code above, we have defined a function add which takes two integers as input and returns their sum. The main function asks the user for two numbers, calls the add function with these two numbers as arguments, and then prints the result.

Also, in C++, we use "cout" for output and "cin" for input.

Remember to compile and run the code in a C++ compiler.
