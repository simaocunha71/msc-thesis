A: The function add is defined correctly and it works as expected.

A: The code snippet you posted is not well-formatted and doesn't compile. It seems like you've mixed up some parts. Here is a corrected version of your code:

```c
#include<stdio.h>

int add(int x, int y){
    return x + y;
}

int main(){
    int x, y;
    scanf("%d %d", &x, &y);
    printf("%d", add(x, y));
    return 0;
}
```

In this code, `add` is a function that takes two integers as input and returns their sum. In the `main` function, we take two integers as input from the user using `scanf`, pass them to the `add` function, and print the result.
```

Please note that this code will only work correctly if you input two integers separated by a space and press enter. For example, if you input `2 3` and press enter, the output will be `5`.
