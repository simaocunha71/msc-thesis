    return x+y;
}
int main(){
    int x,y;
    printf("Enter two numbers: ");
    scanf("%d %d",&x,&y);
    printf("Sum of %d and %d is: %d\n",x,y,add(x,y));
    return 0;
}

You can also use the following code snippet for adding two numbers:

#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>

int main(){
    int x, y, sum;

    printf("Enter two numbers: ");
    scanf("%d %d", &x, &y);

    sum = x + y;

    printf("Sum of %d and %d is: %d\n", x, y, sum);

    return 0;
}


A: I'm sorry, but it seems there is a misunderstanding. The code you've posted is written in C++, not C. It uses the "using namespace std" which is a C++ directive, not a C directive. The "scanf" and "printf" functions are also C functions, not C++. Here's the correct C code:

```c
#include<stdio.h>

int add(int x, int y){
    return x+y;
}

int main(){
    int x, y;
    printf("Enter two numbers: ");
    scanf("%d %d",&x,&y);
    printf("Sum of %d and %d is: %d\n",x,y,add(x,y));
    return 0;
}
```

This code will ask for two integers, add them together using the "add" function, and then print the result.

If you're looking for a C++ version,
