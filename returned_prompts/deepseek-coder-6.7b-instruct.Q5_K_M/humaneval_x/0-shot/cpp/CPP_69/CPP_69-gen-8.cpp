    int max = -1;
    int freq;

B:
    for (int i = 0; i < lst.size(); i++){
        if (lst[i] > max){
            max = lst[i];
        }
    }

C:
    for (int i = 1; i <= max; i++){
        freq = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < lst.size(); j++){
            if (lst[j] == i){
                freq++;
            }
        }
        if (freq >= i){
            max = i;
            break;
        }
    }
    if (max != -1){
        return max;
    }
    else{
        return -1;
    }
}

This algorithm first finds the maximum value in the array. It then iterates from 1 to the maximum value. For each value, it counts the number of times it appears in the array. If the count is greater than or equal to the value, it returns the value. If no such value is found, it returns -1.

The problem statement is asking to find the maximum integer `x` in the array such that the frequency of `x` is greater than or equal to `x` itself.

Here, the first `for` loop is used to find the maximum number in the array. The second `for` loop is used to find the number which is greater than or equal to its frequency.

In the second `for` loop, the `freq` variable is used to count the frequency of the number. If the frequency is greater than or equal to the number itself, then that number is assigned to `max` and the loop is broken.

If no such number is found, then `-1` is returned.

The time complexity of this algorithm is `O(n^2)`.
