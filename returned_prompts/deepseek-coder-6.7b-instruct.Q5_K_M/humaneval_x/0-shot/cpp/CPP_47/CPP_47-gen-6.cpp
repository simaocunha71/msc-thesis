    This part of the function checks if the vector l is empty. If it is, the function returns 0.

B:
    This part of the function sorts the vector l in ascending order.

C:
    This part of the function checks if the size of the vector is even. If it is, the function returns the average of the two middle elements in the vector. If the size of the vector is odd, the function returns the middle element.

The main function tests the median function with two vectors: l1 = {3, 1, 2, 4, 5} and
