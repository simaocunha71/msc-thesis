This code defines a function called `count_up_to` that takes an integer `n` and returns a vector of prime numbers less than `n`. The function works by iterating over all integers from 2 to `n`, and for each integer `i`, it checks if `i` has any divisors other than 1 and itself. If `i` does not have any such divisors, it is a prime number and is added to the vector. The function then returns the vector of prime numbers.

The `main` function asks the user for a non-negative integer, calls `count_up_to` with that integer, and then prints the prime numbers less than the input integer.

The time complexity of this code is O(n^2), because for each number from 2 to `n`, it checks if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself, which takes O(sqrt(n)) time. Therefore, the total time complexity of the code is O(n^2 * sqrt(n)).

The space complexity is O(n), because in the worst case, all numbers from 2 to `n` are prime and are stored in the vector.
