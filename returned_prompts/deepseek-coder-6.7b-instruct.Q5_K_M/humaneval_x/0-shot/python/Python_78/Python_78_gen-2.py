The function `hex_key` takes a hexadecimal number as a string and counts the number of hexadecimal digits that are primes. It does this by creating a set of the hexadecimal digits that are primes. It then uses a generator expression to iterate over each digit in the input string and checks if it is in the primes set. The `sum` function is used to count the number of True values (which occur when the digit is in the primes set), which gives the count of primes in the string.

The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because it iterates over each character in the string once. The space complexity is also O(n), because of the set of primes and the generator expression.

Note: The hexadecimal digits 'A' (10), 'B' (11), 'C' (12), 'D' (13), 'E' (14), and 'F' (15) are not considered primes in this context as they are not natural numbers.
