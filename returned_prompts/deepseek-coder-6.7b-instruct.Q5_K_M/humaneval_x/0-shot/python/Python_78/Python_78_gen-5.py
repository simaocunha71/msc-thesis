    return sum(i in prime_hex for i in num)

print(hex_key("AB"))  # 1
print(hex_key("1077E"))  # 2

# The function hex_key works by creating a list of prime hexadecimal digits. 
# Then it counts how many digits in the input string are in this list and returns that count.

# This is a simple solution that works in Python. 
# It uses the built-in sum function in combination with a generator expression to count the number of prime hexadecimal digits.
# The generator expression 'i in prime_hex for i in num' generates True for each digit in num that is a prime hexadecimal digit, and False otherwise. 
# The sum function adds up these Trues to give the count of prime hexadecimal digits.
