'''
In the function hex_key(), we are iterating over each character in the string num. If the character is in the list hex_nums (which contains the hexadecimal digits that are primes), we increase the counter by 1. We then return the total count.
'''

'''
The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the string num. This is because we are iterating over each character in the string once.
'''

'''
The space complexity of this function is O(1), because we are using a fixed amount of space to store the hexadecimal digits that are primes. This does not change with the size of the input string num.
'''

'''
The function passes all the test cases provided in the question.
'''

'''
Overall, this function is a simple and efficient way to solve the problem.
'''

'''
Note: The function assumes that the input string contains only hexadecimal digits and uppercase letters. If this is not the case, the function may not work as expected.
'''

'''
Also note that this function does not handle decimal numbers. If you want to count the prime digits in a decimal number, you would need to convert the number to hexadecimal first.
