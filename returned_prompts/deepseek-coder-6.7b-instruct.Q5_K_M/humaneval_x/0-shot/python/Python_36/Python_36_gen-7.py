#  I'm not sure if this is the correct solution, but the tests are failing and I'm not sure why.
#  Could you please help me to understand why?

#  The function `count_sevens` is supposed to count the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.
#  The function `fizz_buzz` should return the total count of the digit 7 in those numbers.
#  However, the tests are failing and I'm not sure why. Could you please help me to understand why?

#  The problem is that the function `count_sevens` is not counting the numbers correctly. It seems like it's not correctly checking if the numbers are divisible by 11 or 13.
#  I've tried to debug it by printing out the numbers it's checking, and they seem to be correct.
#  Could you please help me to understand why the tests are failing?
