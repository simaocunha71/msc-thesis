```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int:
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:
            count += str(i).count('7')
    return count
```

Explanation:

In this solution, we iterate over all numbers from 0 to n (exclusive). If the current number is divisible by 11 or 13, we convert it to a string and count the number of times '7' appears in it. We add this count to our total. Finally, we return the total count.

This solution uses a loop and string count operation, so its time complexity is O(n).

```python
assert fizz_buzz(50) == 0
assert fizz_buzz(78) == 2
assert fizz_buzz(79) == 3
```

This assert statement checks that our function works correctly for all test cases.

Note: This solution assumes that n is a positive integer. If n can be negative or zero, we would need to adjust the range and the if condition in the loop.

Note: This solution counts '7's in numbers that are divisible by 11 or 13, not in the numbers themselves. If you want to count '7's in the numbers themselves, you would need to change the loop range and if condition to start from 1, and add the count of '7's in each number to the total.
