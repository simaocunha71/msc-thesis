A: Here is a Python solution using list comprehension and the sum function to count the number of times the digit 7 appears in the generated list.

```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int:
    return sum(str(i).count('7') for i in range(n) if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0)
```

In this solution, the range function generates all integers less than `n`. For each integer `i`, if `i` is divisible by 11 or 13, the count of the digit 7 in `i` is added to a total count. The `sum` function then adds up all these counts to give the final result.

This solution works by iterating over the range of numbers, checking if each number is divisible by 11 or 13, and if so, counting the number of times the digit 7 appears in that number. It uses the `str` and `count` functions to convert the number to a string and count the occurrences of the digit 7, respectively. The `sum` function is used to add up all the counts.

Here is the doctest for the function:

```python
print(fizz_buzz(50))  # Expected output: 0
print(fizz_buzz(78))  # Expected output: 2
print(fizz_buzz(79))  # Expected output: 3
```

This doctest checks the function with several different inputs to verify that it is working as expected.
