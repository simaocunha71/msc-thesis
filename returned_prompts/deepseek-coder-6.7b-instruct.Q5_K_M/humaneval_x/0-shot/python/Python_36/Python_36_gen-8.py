A: The function `fizz_buzz` works by looping through all integers less than `n`. It checks whether each number is divisible by either 11 or 13 by checking the remainder when the number is divided by 11 or 13 (`i % 11` and `i % 13` respectively). If a number is divisible by 11 or 13, it converts the number to a string and counts the number of times the digit '7' appears in that string (`str(i).count('7')`). The function then adds this count to a total count which is returned at the end.

The function uses the `doctest` module to test itself. If all the tests pass, it will print "100% passed". If any tests fail, it will print "Failed 1 of 2 tests".

This function could be optimized by checking numbers divisible by 11 and 13 separately, but this would only save a little bit of time in this case.
Also, the complexity of this solution is O(n), which is the best we can achieve for this problem.

Here is a more optimized solution:

```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    count = 0
    for i in range(11, n, 11):
        count += str(i).count('7')
    for i in range(13, n, 13):
        count += str(i).count('7')
    return count
```
This optimized solution checks numbers divisible by 11 and 13 separately and only converts numbers to strings once, which reduces the number of times the string conversion is done.
