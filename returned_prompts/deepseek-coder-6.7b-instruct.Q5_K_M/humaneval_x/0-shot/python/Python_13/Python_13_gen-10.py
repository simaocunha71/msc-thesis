Explanation:

The function `greatest_common_divisor` uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers. This algorithm is based on the principle that the greatest common divisor of two numbers does not change if the larger number is replaced by its difference with the smaller number. 

The function starts by initializing `a` and `b` to the input numbers. Then it enters a loop that continues as long as `b` is not zero. In each iteration of the loop, it updates `a` and `b` to `b` and `a mod b`, respectively. This is the Euclidean algorithm step where it replaces `a` with `b` and `b` with `a mod b`. 

When `b` becomes zero, the function returns `a` as the greatest common divisor.

This function uses the modulo operator `%` to calculate the remainder of the division of `a` by `b`. The remainder is then stored in `b`. The process continues until `b` becomes zero. At this point, `a` is the greatest common divisor of the original inputs.

This function is efficient and can handle large inputs. The time complexity of the function is O(log min(a, b)).



The example usage of this function returns the greatest common divisor of 3 and 5 as 1 and the greatest common divisor of 25 and 15 as 5.
