    negatives = [x for x in lst if x < 0]
    positives = [x for x in lst if x > 0]
    if negatives:
        a = max(negatives)
    else:
        a = None
    if positives:
        b = min(positives)
    else:
        b = None
    return (a, b)

# Test cases
print(largest_smallest_integers([2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7]))  # == (None, 1)
print(largest_smallest_integers([]))  # == (None, None)
print(largest_smallest_integers([0]))  # == (None, None)

# Output:
# (None, 1)
# (None, None)
# (None, None)

# The function works by first filtering the list into two lists, negatives and positives, then it either finds the maximum of the negatives, or sets a to None. It does the same for the positives or sets b to None. The function then returns a tuple of a and b.
