Heron's formula:
The area of a triangle whose sides have lengths a, b, and c is given by:
Area = âˆš[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)]
where s is the semi-perimeter of the triangle given by:
s = (a + b + c) / 2
'''

'''
In this solution, the first thing we do is to check if the three sides can form a valid triangle. 
If they can't, we return -1.

If they can, we calculate the semi-perimeter of the triangle.

Finally, we use Heron's formula to calculate the area of the triangle.
We round the area to 2 decimal places before returning it.
