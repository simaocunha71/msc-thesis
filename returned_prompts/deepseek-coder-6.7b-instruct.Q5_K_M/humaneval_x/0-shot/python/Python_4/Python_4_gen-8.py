from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    return sum(abs(x - mean) for x in numbers) / len(numbers)

print(mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]))

In this code, we first calculate the mean of the numbers. Then, we calculate the absolute difference between each number and the mean, sum these differences, and divide by the number of numbers to get the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD).

We can run the function with the list `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]`, and it will return `1.0`, which is the expected result.

Note: This code does not handle the case where the input list is empty, as the mathematical definition of mean and standard deviation does not define a result for an empty set. You may want to add error handling for this case, depending on your specific needs.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list, because we have to go through each element in the list once to calculate the mean and once to calculate the MAD. The space complexity is O(1), because we only store a constant number of variables, regardless of the size of the input list.

Finally, note that this function uses the built-in `abs` function to calculate the absolute value, and the `sum` function to calculate the sum of a list.


This function can be used in a variety of contexts, such as data analysis, statistics, and machine learning. For example, it can be used to detect outliers in a dataset.

The function is also a good example of how to write a Python function that uses a mathematical formula and a list of numbers to calculate a result. It's a good practice to write such functions for various mathematical and statistical operations.
