def search(lst):
    count = collections.Counter(lst)
    vals = sorted([k for k, v in count.items() if v >= k], reverse=True)
    return vals[0] if vals else -1

print(search([4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]))  # 2
print(search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]))  # 3
print(search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]))  # -1

This solution uses collections.Counter to count the frequency of each number in the list. It then creates a list of keys (numbers) that have a count greater than or equal to the key itself, sorts this list in descending order, and returns the first element (the greatest number that meets the criteria), or -1 if the list is empty.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) because of the sorting operation. The space complexity is O(n) as it creates a Counter object and a list.

This solution assumes that the input list is not empty, as it does not handle that case.

Note: This solution assumes that the input list is not empty. If the list could be empty, you should add a check for this case at the beginning of the function.

Here is the solution with a check for an empty list:

def search(lst):
    if not lst:
        return -1
    count = collections.Counter(lst)
    vals = sorted([k for k, v in count.items() if v >= k], reverse=True)
    return vals[0] if vals else -1

print(search([]))  # -1
print(search([4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]))  # 2
print(search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]))  # 3
print(search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]))  # -1

This version of the solution handles the case where the input list is
