# In this code, we first calculate the frequency of each integer in the list and store them in a dictionary. 
# Then we find the maximum frequency. 
# We iterate over the dictionary and for each key-value pair, if the value is greater than or equal to the key 
# and equals to the maximum frequency, we return the key. If no such key-value pair is found, we return -1.
