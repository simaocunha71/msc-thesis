The function `cycpattern_check` rotates the string `b` by one character and checks if it's a substring of `a`. If it is, the function returns `True`. If no rotation of `b` is a substring of `a`, the function returns `False`.

This solution assumes that `a` and `b` are strings of lowercase letters. It also assumes that the rotation of a string is defined as the string with its first character moved to the end.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) because it uses a loop that runs n times and inside this loop, it checks if `b` is a substring of `a`, which takes O(n) time.

This solution has a space complexity of O(1) because it uses a fixed amount of space to store the strings `a` and `b`, and the variables `i` and `temp`.

This solution is correct because it checks each rotation of `b` to see if it is a substring of `a`. If any rotation of `b` is a substring of `a`, the function returns `True`. If none of the rotations of `b` are substrings of `a`, the function returns `False`.

This solution is efficient because it uses a loop to check each rotation of `b`, which takes O(n) time.
