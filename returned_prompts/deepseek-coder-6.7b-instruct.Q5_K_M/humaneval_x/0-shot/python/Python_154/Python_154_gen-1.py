This function works by rotating the second word (b) by one character and checking if the rotated word is a substring of the first word (a). If it is, the function returns True. If the function has rotated the word through all possible rotations without finding a match, it returns False.

The time complexity of the function is O(n*m) where n is the length of the first word and m is the length of the second word. This is because in the worst case scenario, the function needs to check if the second word is a substring of the first word for every possible rotation of the second word.

The space complexity of the function is O(1) because the function only uses a constant amount of extra space to store the rotated word and does not use any data structures that scale with the input size.

This function assumes that the input words are both lowercase and do not contain any special characters or numbers. If these assumptions are not true, the function will need to be modified to handle these cases.

Also, this function does not handle the case where the second word is longer than the first word. If this is a possibility, the function should be modified to return False if the length of the second word is greater than the length of the first word.

Finally, this function does not handle the case where the second word is an empty string. If this is a possibility, the function should be modified to always return True.

Here is the modified version of the function that handles these cases:

    def cycpattern_check(a , b):
        if len(b) > len(a
