            a, b = b, a
        return [i for i in range(a, b+1) if i % 2 == 0]

    print(generate_integers(2, 8))  # [2, 4, 6, 8]
    print(generate_integers(8, 2))  # [2, 4, 6, 8]

Note:

This solution uses list comprehension to generate the list of even integers in the range from min(a, b) to max(a, b). The condition i % 2 == 0 checks if the integer i is even by using the modulus operator. If the remainder of i divided by 2 is 0, then i is even, and it's included in the list.
