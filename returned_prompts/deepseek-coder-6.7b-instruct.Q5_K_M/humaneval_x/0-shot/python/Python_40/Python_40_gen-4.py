# This is a solution to the problem you provided. It uses a combination of sorting and two-pointer technique to solve the problem.
# The time complexity is O(n^2) where n is the length of the list.
# The space complexity is O(1) as no additional space is used.
# This solution assumes that the input list is not empty. If the input list can be empty, you should add a check for this case.
# This solution also assumes that the input list does not contain any non-integer elements. If this is not the case, you should add a check for this as well.
# This solution also assumes that the input list does not contain any duplicate elements. If this is not the case, you should add a check for this as well.
# This solution assumes that the input list contains at least three elements. If this is not the case, you should add a check for this as well.
# This solution assumes that the input list contains only integers. If this is not the case, you should add a check for this as well.
# This solution assumes that the input list contains integers that are within the range of Python's integer. If this is not the case,
