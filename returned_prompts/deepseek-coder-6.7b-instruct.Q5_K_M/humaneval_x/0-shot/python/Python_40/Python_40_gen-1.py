This solution works by sorting the list first. Then for each element in the list, we use two pointers to find a triple that sums to zero. The left pointer starts after the current element, and the right pointer starts at the end of the list. If the sum of the elements at the left and right pointers is less than the current element, we move the left pointer to the right. If the sum is greater than the current element, we move the right pointer to the left. If we find a triple that sums to zero, we return True. If we don't find any such triple, we return False.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) where n is the length of the list, because for each element in the list, we perform a binary search on the remaining elements. The space complexity is O(1) since we only use a constant amount of space.

This solution assumes that the input list is sorted. If the input list is not sorted, you can add a line to sort it before performing the binary search.

This solution also assumes that the input list contains distinct elements. If the input list may contain duplicate elements, you can add a line to skip duplicate elements when performing the binary
