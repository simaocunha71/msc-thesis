A: The given problem is a variation of the 3-sum problem. You need to find three numbers in a list that add up to zero. The key difference here is that the list can have duplicate numbers.

The approach I've taken is to sort the list first. This allows us to use a two-pointer technique to find the three numbers. The two pointers start at the index next to the current number and end at the last index. If the sum of the current number and the numbers at the two pointers is less than zero, we move the start pointer to the right. If the sum is more than zero, we move the end pointer to the left. If the sum is exactly zero, we return True.

The reason we need to check for duplicates is to avoid counting the same triple multiple times. If the current number is the same as the previous number, we skip this iteration because the previous triple has already been counted.

Finally, if we've checked all the numbers and haven't found a triple that sums to zero, we return False.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) because we use a nested loop to check all pairs of numbers. The space complexity is O(1) because we only use a constant amount of extra space.

So, this solution is efficient and works correctly.
