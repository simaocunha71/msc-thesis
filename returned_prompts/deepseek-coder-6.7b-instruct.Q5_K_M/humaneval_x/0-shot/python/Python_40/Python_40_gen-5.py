"""
Explanation:

The function `triples_sum_to_zero` takes a list of integers as an input. It first sorts the list. Then it uses a three-pointer technique to find three elements in the list that sum to zero.

The function loops over the list, and for each element, it uses two pointers to find the other two elements that sum to the negative of the current element. The left pointer starts one index after the current index, and the right pointer starts at the end of the list. If the sum of the current element, the left element, and the right element is less than zero, the left pointer is incremented. If the sum is greater than zero, the right pointer is decremented. If the sum is zero, the function returns True.

If the function doesn't find three elements that sum to zero, it returns False.
"""

# The time complexity of this function is O(n^2) because it uses a nested loop to find the other two elements. The space complexity is O(1) because it uses a constant amount of space.

# The function works by trying all possible combinations of three elements in the list. If it finds three elements that sum to zero, it returns True. If it doesn't find any such combinations, it returns False.
