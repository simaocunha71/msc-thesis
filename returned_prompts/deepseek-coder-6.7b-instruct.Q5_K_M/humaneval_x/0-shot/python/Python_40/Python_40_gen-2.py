Explanation:
The function triples_sum_to_zero uses the two-pointer technique to find three numbers in the input list that sum to zero. 

First, it sorts the input list. Then it loops through the list with a for loop. For each number, it initializes two pointers, one at the next index and the other at the last index of the list. It calculates the sum of the current number and the two numbers pointed to by the two pointers. 

If the sum is less than zero, it increases the left pointer by one. If the sum is greater than zero, it decreases the right pointer by one. If the sum is exactly zero, it returns True because it has found three numbers that sum to zero. 

If the function completes the loop without finding three numbers that sum to zero, it returns False.

This function runs in O(n^2) time because it loops through the list and for each number, it performs a constant amount of work. The space complexity is O(1) because it uses a constant amount of space.

The function also works correctly for lists with negative numbers because it treats the sum as the sum of three numbers, not two.
