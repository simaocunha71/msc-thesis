Explanation:

The function `triples_sum_to_zero` takes a list of integers as input and checks if there are three numbers in the list that sum to zero.

First, the list is sorted in ascending order. Then, three pointers `i`, `j`, and `k` are used to traverse through the list. `i` and `j` start from the beginning of the list and `k` starts from the end of the list. The sum of the numbers at indices `i`, `j`, and `k` is calculated.

If the sum is less than zero, `j` is incremented by 1. If the sum is greater than zero, `k` is decremented by 1. If the sum is equal to zero, the function returns `True` because three numbers sum to zero.

If the function completes the traversal without finding three numbers that sum to zero, it returns `False`.
