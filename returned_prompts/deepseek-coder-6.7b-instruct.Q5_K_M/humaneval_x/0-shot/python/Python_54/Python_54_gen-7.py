All of these are correct and will work for your test cases. 

The first two solutions are pretty straightforward and will work for any two strings. 

The third solution uses the Counter class from the collections module, which counts the number of occurrences of each character in a string. This is more efficient than the first two solutions for longer strings. 

In all three cases, if the two strings have the same characters, their sorted versions or character counts will be equal.

    return set(s0) == set(s1)

The above code is correct. It uses the set data structure in Python, which automatically removes duplicates and doesn't maintain order. It then checks if the sets of characters in both strings are equal. If they are, it means that the two strings have the same characters (ignoring order and duplicates).

In the doctest.testmod() function, it will run the tests and print out the results. If all of the tests pass, it will print "1 tests passed." If any of the tests fail, it will print "1 tests failed."

It is important to note that the order of characters matters in this solution. So, 'abc' and 'cba' would not be considered the same.

Also, note that this solution is case-sensitive. So, 'a' and 'A' would be considered different characters. If you want to ignore case, you can convert both strings to lower or upper case before checking.

Overall, this solution is a good choice if the order of characters doesn't
