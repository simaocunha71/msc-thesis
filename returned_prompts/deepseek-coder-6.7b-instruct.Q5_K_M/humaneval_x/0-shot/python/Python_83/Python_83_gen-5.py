Here we are iterating over the range of n-digit numbers (0 to 9 for n=1, 0 to 99 for n=2, 0 to 999 for n=3, etc.). If the number is at the beginning (i==0) or the end (i==n-1) of the n-digit number, we increment the count by 2 (since the number could start or end with a 1). For all other numbers, we increment the count by 1.

Note: This solution assumes that the count of n-digit numbers starts at 0 and ends at 9 for n=1, 0 to 99 for n=2, 0 to 999 for n=3, etc. This is a standard convention in number theory, but it could vary depending on the specifics of the problem.

Note: This solution also assumes that the count of n-digit numbers starts at 1 (not 0) for n=1, 2 (not 10) for n=2, 3 (not 100) for n=3, etc. This is a standard convention in number theory, but it could vary depending on the specifics of the problem.

Note: This solution does not include the number 1 itself in the count, but it does include the number 10, 100, 1000, etc., up to 10^n. This is a standard convention in number theory, but it could vary depending on the specifics of the problem.

Note: This solution does not include negative numbers in the count, but it does include the number 0 in the count. This is a standard convention in number theory, but it could vary depending on the specifics of the problem.

Note: This solution does not include numbers that start or end with 0 (except for the number 0 itself), but
