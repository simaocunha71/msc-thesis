Explanation:

The function starts_one_ends(n) calculates the number of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1. 

If n is less than 1, it returns 0. If n is 1, it returns 1 because there is only one 1-digit number that starts or ends with 1.

For n greater than 1, it uses the formula 2 * 10**(n-2) - (n == 2). The formula is derived from the definition of n-digit numbers that start or end with 1. 

The function then returns the calculated result. The function uses the power function 10**(n-2) to calculate the number of n-2 digit numbers, and multiplies it by 2 to account for the two choices (starts or ends)
