    numbers_dict = {'zero': 0, 'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3, 'four': 4, 'five': 5, 'six': 6, 'seven': 7, 'eight': 8, 'nine': 9}
    numbers_list = numbers.split()

This solution works by creating a dictionary that maps each string number to its corresponding integer value. It then splits the input string into a list of strings, sorts the list using the dictionary to determine the order of the strings, and joins the sorted list back into a space-delimited string.

It is important to note that the time complexity of this solution is O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the list. This is because the sorting operation has a time complexity of O(n log n).

The space complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. This is because the sorted list and the input list are both created and stored in memory.

This solution assumes that the input string will always contain valid choices. If the input string might contain invalid choices, then the solution should be modified to handle this case.

This solution also assumes that the input string will always contain unique numbers. If the input string might contain duplicate numbers, then the solution should be modified to handle this case.

This solution uses Python's built-in sort function, which sorts the elements in ascending order. If you want to sort the elements in descending order, you can pass the argument `reverse=True` to the `sorted` function.

This solution uses Python's built-in `split` method to split the input string into a list of strings. This method splits the string at each occurrence of a space character. If you want to split the string at a different character, you can pass the character to the `split` method as an argument.

This solution uses Python's built-in `join
