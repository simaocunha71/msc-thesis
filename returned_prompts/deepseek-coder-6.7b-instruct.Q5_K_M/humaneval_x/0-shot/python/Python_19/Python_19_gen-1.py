num_dict = {"zero": 0, "one": 1, "two": 2, "three": 3, "four": 4, "five": 5, "six": 6, "seven": 7, "eight": 8, "nine": 9}
    rev_dict = {v: k for k, v in num_dict.items()}
    numbers = numbers.split()
    numbers = [num_dict[i] for i in numbers]
    numbers.sort()
    return ' '.join(rev_dict[i] for i in numbers)

print(sort_numbers('three one five'))

This Python code works by firstly creating dictionaries to map the English words to numbers and vice versa. Then it splits the input string into a list of words, converts each word to its corresponding number, sorts the list of numbers, and finally converts the sorted list of numbers back to words to form the output string.

The time complexity of this code is O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the input list. This is because the sort function has a time complexity of O(n log n). The space complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list. This is because we are storing the input words in a list and the numbers in another list.

I hope this helps. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask.


A: Here's a Python solution:

```python
def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    num_dict = {"zero": 0, "one": 1, "two": 2, "three": 3, "four": 4, "five": 5, "six": 6, "seven": 7, "eight": 8, "nine": 9}
    numbers = numbers.split()
    numbers = [num_dict[i] for i in numbers]
    numbers.sort()
    return ' '.join(numbers)

print(sort_numbers('three one five'))
```

Explanation:
We first create a dictionary `num_dict` that maps English words to their corresponding numbers. Then we split the input string `
