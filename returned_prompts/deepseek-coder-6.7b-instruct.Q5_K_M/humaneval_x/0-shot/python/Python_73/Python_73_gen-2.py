This solution works by iterating over the first half of the array and comparing each element with the corresponding element from the end of the array. If they are not equal, we increment our count. This count is the minimum number of changes required to make the array palindromic.

In the first example, we need to change the 5 and the 7 to make the array palindromic. In the second example, we only need to change the 3 to make the array palindromic. In the third example, the array is already palindromic so no changes are needed.
