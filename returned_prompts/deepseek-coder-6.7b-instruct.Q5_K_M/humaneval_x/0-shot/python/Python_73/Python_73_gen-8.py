This solution works by comparing the elements at the beginning and end of the array, moving towards the center, and incrementing a counter for each pair that don't match. This is because each pair of different elements in the array will require one change to make them the same, and the number of changes will be the minimum number of changes needed to make the array palindromic.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array, because it needs to iterate over half of the array once. The space complexity is O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of additional space to store the changes counter.

This solution assumes that the input array is not empty and contains at least one element. If the input array could be empty, the function should be modified to handle this case.

Also note that this solution assumes that the elements in the array are integers and that the "change" operation means changing one element to any other integer. If the problem statement had a different interpretation of these terms, the solution would need to be adjusted accordingly.

Finally, this solution is case sensitive, meaning that it treats the integers 1 and 2 as different integers. If this is not the desired behavior, the solution should be adjusted accordingly.
