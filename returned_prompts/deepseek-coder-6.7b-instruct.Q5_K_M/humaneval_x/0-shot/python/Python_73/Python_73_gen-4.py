# This Python program uses a two-pointer approach to solve the problem.
# The pointer l is set to the start of the array and the pointer r is set to the end of the array.
# The program then enters a while loop, which continues until l is greater than or equal to r.
# Inside the loop, the program checks if the elements at the lth and rth positions are the same.
# If they are not, then one element needs to be changed to make the array palindromic, so count is incremented by 1.
# Regardless of whether the elements were the same or not, l is incremented by 1 and r is decremented by 1 to move the pointers towards the center of the array.
# Finally, the program returns the count, which represents the minimum number of changes needed to make the array palindromic.
# The time complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the length of the array.
# The space complexity of this program is O(1), because no additional space is used.
# This program should be able to handle arrays of any length, as long as they are not empty.
# If the array is empty, the function will return 0, which is the correct result.
# If the array has one element, the function will return 0, which is the correct result.
# If the array has two elements and they are the same, the function will return 0, which is the correct result.
# If the array has two elements and they are different, the function will return
