In the function, we loop through each character in the string. If the character is alphabetic, we calculate the ASCII value of 'A' or 'a' (depending on whether the character is uppercase or lowercase), subtract it from the ASCII value of the character, add 2 to it (for shifting down by two places), multiply by 2 (as required) and then find the modulus 26 (to wrap around the alphabet). We then add the ASCII value of 'A' or 'a' back to the result to convert it back to a character. If the character is not alphabetic, we just add it to the result as is.

The function returns the encrypted string.

Please note that this function only works with English alphabet characters. Any other characters in the input string are added to the result as is, without any encryption.

Also note that in Python, string indices start at 0, not 1.

This function assumes that the input string is in English and does not contain any special characters or numbers. If the input string contains special characters or numbers, they will be added to the result as is, without any encryption.

This function also assumes that the input string is in English and does not contain any uppercase letters. If the input string contains uppercase letters, they will be encrypted as lowercase letters.
