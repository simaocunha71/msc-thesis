In this solution, we iterate through each character in the input string. If the character is an alphabet, we calculate the ASCII value of the character and then add 2 (to shift down by two places) and multiply by 2. We then take the modulus of this result with 26 (the number of alphabets) to ensure that the result stays within the range of alphabets. We then convert the result back to the corresponding ASCII value by subtracting the ASCII offset and adding ASCII offset again. If the character is not an alphabet, we leave it as it is. We return the encrypted string.

We test the function with different inputs to ensure it works correctly.

Note: The rotation is performed in a cyclic manner (i.e., 'z' rotates to 'b' and 'Z' rotates to 'Y'). Also, non-alphabetic characters are left unchanged.

Also, keep in mind that Python uses zero-based indexing.

Note: This solution assumes that the input string only contains ASCII characters. If the input string can contain Unicode characters, you may
