In the given code, we are shifting the letters by 4 places (2*2). If the shifted character exceeds 'z', we wrap around to the start of the alphabet.

We are also taking care of cases where the string contains non-alphabetic characters. These characters are left as they are, and are appended to the encrypted string as is.

Please note that the function is case-sensitive. If you want it to be case-insensitive, you can convert the input string to lowercase before processing it.

Also, please note that the function only shifts letters and leaves non-alphabetic characters as is. If you want to shift digits or special characters as well, you'll need to adjust the code accordingly.
