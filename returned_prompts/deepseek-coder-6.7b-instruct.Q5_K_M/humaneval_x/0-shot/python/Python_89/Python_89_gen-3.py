In this code, we are defining the function encrypt that takes a string s as input. For each character in the string, if the character is alphabetic, we calculate the ASCII value of the character, add the shift (which is 2 * 2 = 4), and then get the new character by converting the ASCII value back to a character. If the new character exceeds the ASCII value of 'z', we subtract 26 from it to wrap around to the start of the alphabet. Non-alphabetic characters are added to the encrypted string unchanged. The function returns the encrypted string.

The shift value of 4 is chosen because it satisfies the condition of rotating the alphabet down by two places and then multiplying by two places. The shift value can be adjusted to change the amount of rotation.

Note that the function is case-insensitive, meaning it treats uppercase and lowercase letters the same.

Additionally, the function does not handle non-alphabetic characters or digits. If you need to handle these cases, you would need to add additional code to handle them.

Finally, this function uses the ord() and chr() functions to convert characters to and from their ASCII values. These functions are used because the ASCII values of the characters are used
