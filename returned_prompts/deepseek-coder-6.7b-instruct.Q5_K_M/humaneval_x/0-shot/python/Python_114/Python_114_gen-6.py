    current_sum = min_sum = nums[0]
    for num in nums[1:]:
        current_sum = min(num, current_sum + num)
        min_sum = min(min_sum, current_sum)

# 1. The function first initializes current_sum and min_sum to the first number in the list.
# 2. Then, it iterates over the list, skipping the first number.
# 3. For each number, it calculates the minimum between the current number and the sum of the current number and current_sum. This is used to ensure that the current_sum never goes negative.
# 4. It then checks if the current_sum is less than the current minimum sum, and updates the minimum sum if it is.
# 5. Finally, it returns the minimum sum.

# 6. The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the list.
# 7. The space complexity is O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the variables.

# 8. This function is a dynamic programming solution, as it uses previously computed information to compute the current minimum sum.

# 9. It's a good example of a subarray problem, where a naive approach would be to try all possible subarrays, which would have a time complexity of O(n^2). This function uses a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem in O(n) time.

# 10. It's also a good example of a problem where a greedy approach wouldn't work, because the minimum sum can be negative, and greedy algorithms make decisions based on the current best option, not the global best option.

# 11. This function is useful in a variety of situations, such as in algorithms for scheduling, resource allocation, and network routing.

# 12. It's also a good example of a problem that can be solved with a simple one-pass algorithm, where the solution is computed in a single pass over the input data.

# 13. It's a good example of a problem that can be solved with a linear time complexity, because it only requires a single pass over the input data.
