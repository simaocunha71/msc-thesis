In the code above, we use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. When we encounter a closing bracket, we pop the last element from the stack. If the stack is empty at the end, it means that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket and the function returns True. If there is an element left in the stack, it means there is a missing closing bracket and the function returns False.

Please note that this function assumes that the input string only contains "(" and ")". If other characters are included in the string, the function may not work as expected.

Also, it's important to note that this function uses the "first-in-last-out" (FILO) behavior of the stack data structure to solve the problem. The last opening bracket we encounter is the first one to be matched with the closing bracket, so we need to process the string from left to right.

If you want to check if all brackets are properly balanced and in the right order, you would need a different approach.
