# The function works by using a stack to keep track of the brackets. It iterates through the string of brackets.
# If it encounters an opening bracket, it pushes it onto the stack. If it encounters a closing bracket,
# it checks whether the stack is empty or the last bracket in the stack is not an opening bracket.
# If either of these conditions are true, it returns False, as there's no corresponding opening bracket for the closing bracket.
# If the stack is not empty and the last bracket in the stack is an opening bracket, it pops it from the stack.
# After iterating through all the brackets, if the stack is empty, it returns True, as every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.
# If the stack is not empty, it returns False, as there are unmatched opening brackets.

# The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of brackets in the string.
# This is because it makes a single pass through the string. The space complexity is also O(n), as in the worst case,
# all the brackets could be opening brackets and the stack would contain all of them.
# In the best case, where the string is correctly bracketed, the space complexity is O(1), as the stack would be empty.

# This function is useful for validating the bracketing in a string of parentheses, braces, or brackets.
# It can be used in syntax checking, code formatting, and in many other areas where you need to ensure that brackets are correctly matched.
# It's a classic example of how a stack can be used to solve a problem related to bracketing.
