In this function, we first define the list of planets. We then check if either of the input planets are in the list, if not we return an empty tuple. If they are, we find the indices of the input planets in the list, and take all planets between these indices, inclusive. We return this list as a tuple.

This solution assumes that the input planets are always valid, and that the order of the planets in the solar system is always as stated. If this is not the case, we would need to modify the solution to handle potential errors.

In Python, the index function returns the first occurrence of an element in a list. The min and max functions return the smallest and largest elements in a collection. These functions can take multiple arguments, and they return the smallest or largest of the arguments.

We use the list slicing syntax to get all elements from the start index up to but not including the end index. The start index is inclusive, and the end index is exclusive.

We convert the list to a tuple before returning it, because the problem statement specifies that the function should return a tuple.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of planets in the solar system. This is because we use
