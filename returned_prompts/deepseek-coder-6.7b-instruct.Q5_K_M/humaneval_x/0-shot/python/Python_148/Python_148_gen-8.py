This code creates a list of the planets from closest to farthest from the Sun. It then checks the index of the two given planets. It returns all planets between these two indexes (inclusive) as a tuple. If either of the given planets are not in the list of planets, it returns an empty tuple.

It also handles the case where the index of planet1 is greater than the index of planet2 (i.e., the planets are in the reverse order). In this case, it swaps the two indexes to ensure that the planets are returned in the correct order.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of planets. This is because it needs to find the index of each planet in the list of planets. The space complexity is also O(n), as it creates a list of the planets.

Finally, this function assumes that the list of planets is not modified elsewhere in the code. If this is not the case, it may be necessary to make a copy of the list of planets before finding the indices.
