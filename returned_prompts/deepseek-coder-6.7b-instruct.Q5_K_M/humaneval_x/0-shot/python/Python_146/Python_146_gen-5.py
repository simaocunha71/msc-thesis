I'm not sure if the question is correct or not, but the logic is sound. We just need to iterate over the array and for each number, we get the first and last digit and check if they are odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9). If yes, we increase the count.

The test cases are also correct, they test the function with different inputs to verify that it works as expected.
