Explanation:

In the first test case, 15 is the only number in the array that satisfies the conditions.
In the second test case, 33 and 109 are the numbers in the array that satisfy the conditions.
In the third test case, all the numbers in the array satisfy the conditions.
In the fourth test case, there are no numbers in the array that satisfy the conditions.
In the fifth test case, all the numbers in the array satisfy the conditions.
