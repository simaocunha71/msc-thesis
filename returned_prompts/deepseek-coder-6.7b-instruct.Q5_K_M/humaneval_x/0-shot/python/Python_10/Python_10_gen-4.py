This program uses the `doctest` module to perform unit testing. This module searches for pieces of text that look like interactive Python sessions, and then executes those sessions and verifies if they work exactly as shown.

The `make_palindrome` function uses a helper function `longest_palindrome_postfix` to find the longest postfix of the input string that is a palindrome.

In the end, the function returns a string that is a palindrome and begins with the input string. It does this by appending to the end of the input string the reverse of the prefix of the input string that comes before the palindromic postfix.

The `is_palindrome` function is used to check if the given string is a palindrome.

If you run the program with the `doctest.testmod()` function, it will automatically test the docstrings of the functions. If all tests are passed, it will print "All tests passed." If not, it will print the first failed test.

This program is case sensitive and doesn't handle punctuation or whitespace. It's also not optimized for long strings. It's a simple solution that should work for small inputs.

This algorithm could be optimized for larger inputs by using a more advanced string matching algorithm, such as the Knuth–Morris–Pratt (KMP) algorithm or the Rabin-Karp algorithm.

Note: The `doctest` module is included in the standard Python library, so you don't need to install anything extra to use it.
