# This code works by first splitting the string into sentences by using '.' as the delimiter.
# It then strips any leading or trailing white spaces from each sentence.
# After that, it splits each sentence into a list of words.
# Finally, it iterates through each list of words (which represents a sentence) and checks if the first word is "I".
# If it is, it increments the counter. The function then returns the counter, which represents the number of sentences starting with "I".
