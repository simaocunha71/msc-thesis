# Test Cases:

print(is_bored("Hello world")) # 0
print(is_bored("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather")) # 1
print(is_bored("I am bored. It's raining outside. I hate it when it's raining")) # 2
print(is_bored("Why are you always angry? I think I'm getting old")) # 1
print(is_bored("I feel happy. I am learning programming. I have a great day")) # 3

# In the test case "I feel happy. I am learning programming. I have a great day", the function is_bored is supposed to return 3, but it is returning 2. The reason is that the split method is splitting the string at 'I' and counting it as two sentences. The correct count should be 3. Here is the corrected code:

def is_bored(S):
    sentences = S.split('.') + S.split('?') + S.split('A') + S.split('I')
    count = 0
    for sentence in sentences:
        if sentence.strip().startswith('I'):
            count += 1
    return count

# Test Cases:

print(is_bored("Hello world")) # 0
print(is_bored("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather")) # 1
print(is_bored("I am bored. It's raining outside. I hate it when it's raining")) # 2
print(is_bored("Why are you always angry? I think I'm getting old")) # 1
print(is_bored("I feel happy. I am learning programming. I have a great day")) # 3
