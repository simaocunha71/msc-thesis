Explanation:

The given function `monotonic(l: list)` checks whether the given list `l` is monotonically increasing or decreasing. The function returns `True` if the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing and `False` otherwise.

If the length of the list is less than 2, it returns `True` as a list of length 0 or 1 is considered to be monotonically increasing or decreasing.

If the first element of the list is less than the second element, it assumes that the list is monotonically increasing. It then checks if the remaining elements in the list are larger than the previous ones. If they are not, it returns `False`.

If the first element of the list is greater than the second element, it assumes that the list is monotonically decreasing. It then checks if the remaining elements in the list are smaller than the previous ones. If they are not, it returns `False`.

If the first two elements in the list are equal, it checks if the remaining elements are equal to the first element. If they are not, it returns `False`.

If the function has checked all elements in the list and hasn't returned `False`, it returns `True`.
