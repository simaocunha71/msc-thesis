Explanation:

We define two helper functions, factorial and summation. The factorial function recursively calculates the factorial of a given number n, while the summation function calculates the sum of the integers from 1 to n.

In the main function, we use a list comprehension to generate the list. For each index i in the range from 1 to n (inclusive), we use a conditional statement to check if i is even. If it is, we calculate the factorial of i using the factorial function; otherwise, we calculate the sum of the integers from 1 to i using the summation function.

Finally, we return the generated list.

This program should return the correct output for any valid input n.

Note: This solution assumes that n is a positive integer. If n can be zero or negative, additional error checking should be added.
