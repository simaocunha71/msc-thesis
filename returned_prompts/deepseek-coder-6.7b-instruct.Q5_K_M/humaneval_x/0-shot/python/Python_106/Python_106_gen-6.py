This solution defines two helper functions: fact to calculate the factorial of a number and sum_to_n to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n. The main function f constructs the desired list by using a list comprehension, where for each i from 1 to n it checks if i is even, in which case it uses fact(i), otherwise it uses sum_to_n(i).
The solution uses recursive definition of the factorial function.
