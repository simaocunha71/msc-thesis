This solution is based on Python programming language. Here, I have defined two helper functions, "factorial" and "sum_numbers", to calculate the factorial and the sum of numbers from 1 to i respectively. Then, in the main function f, I use list comprehension to generate the desired list. The "factorial" function is called when the index i is even, and the "sum_numbers" function is called when the index i is odd.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) because we have a loop that runs n times. The space complexity is also O(n) because we are storing the result in a list of size n.
