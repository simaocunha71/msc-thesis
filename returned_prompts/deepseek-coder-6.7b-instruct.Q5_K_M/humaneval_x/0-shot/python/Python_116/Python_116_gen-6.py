The function `sort_array` sorts the input array `arr` based on the number of ones in the binary representation of its elements. The Python built-in `sorted` function is used to sort the array, with `key=count_ones` specifying that the sorting should be based on the count of ones in the binary representation. The `bin` function is used to convert the numbers to binary, and the `count` method is used to count the number of ones.

The function `count_ones` is a helper function that returns the number of ones in the binary representation of a given number. The function `sort_array` returns the sorted array.

The time complexity of this function is O(n log n), where n is the length of the input array. This is because the `sorted` function uses a sorting algorithm that has a time complexity of O(n log n). The space complexity is O(n), as a new array is created to store the sorted elements.

This solution handles both positive and negative numbers in the array, as the `bin` function correctly handles negative numbers. However, it does not handle non-integer inputs, as the `bin` function only works with integers.

The function `sort_array` should work correctly for all non-negative integer inputs, and it should return a sorted array in ascending order based on the number of ones in their binary representation, and then based on their decimal value for numbers with the same number of ones.
