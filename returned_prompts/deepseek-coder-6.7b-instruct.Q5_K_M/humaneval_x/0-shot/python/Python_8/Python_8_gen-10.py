The code provided is correct and does the task as specified. 

The function `sum_product` iterates over each number in the provided list, adding it to `sum_numbers` and multiplying it with `product_numbers`. Once all numbers have been processed, it returns a tuple containing the sum and product of all numbers.

If the list is empty, `sum_numbers` will remain 0 and `product_numbers` will remain 1, both of which are the correct results according to the problem statement.

If the list contains the numbers [1, 2, 3, 4], `sum_numbers` will be 10 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4) and `product_numbers` will be 24 (1 * 2 * 3 * 4). Both are the correct results according to the problem statement.

So, the provided code is correct.
