"""
This solution will work for the given problem as it takes each number in the list and adds it to the sum variable, and multiplies it with the product variable. The result is then returned as a tuple.
If the list is empty, the variables sum and product remain 0 and 1 respectively, as specified in the problem statement.
"""

"""
This solution has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the number of elements in the list. This is because it makes a single pass over the list.
"""

"""
This solution has a space complexity of O(1) as it only uses a fixed number of variables. The size of the list itself does not affect the space complexity of the solution.
"""

"""
This solution is correct as it correctly calculates the sum and product of all the numbers in the list.
"""

"""
This solution is efficient as it does not require any unnecessary computation. The time and space complexity are linear, which is the best possible time complexity for this problem.
"""

"""
This solution is also readable and easy to understand. It follows the standard Python conventions and uses clear variable names.
"""

"""
This solution is also testable as it includes a docstring with examples that can be used to test the function.
"""

"""
This solution is also maintainable as it is simple and easy to understand.
"""

"""
This solution is also reusable as it can be used for any list of integers.
"""

"""
This solution is also flexible as it can be easily modified to work with other types of numbers, not just integers.
"""

"""
This solution is also scalable as it can handle lists of any size.
"""

"""
This solution is also adaptable as it can be easily adapted to different situations or requirements.
