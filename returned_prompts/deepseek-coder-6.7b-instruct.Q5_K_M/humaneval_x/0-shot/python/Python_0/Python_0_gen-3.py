def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    numbers.sort()
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        if numbers[i+1] - numbers[i] < threshold:
            return True
    return False

print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))
print(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))


In this solution, we first sort the list of numbers. Then we iterate over the list and check if the difference between the current number and the next number is less than the threshold. If it is, we return True because we've found two numbers that are closer than the threshold. If we've iterated over the entire list without finding two numbers that are closer than the threshold, we return False.

Note that if the list is empty or has less than two elements, the function will return False as there are no pairs to compare.
