This solution sorts the list of numbers and then iterates over the sorted list checking if the difference between the current number and the previous number is less than the threshold. If it is, the function returns True, indicating that a pair of numbers in the list are closer than the threshold. If no such pair is found after checking all numbers, the function returns False.
The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sort operation, where n is the length of the list of numbers. The space complexity is O(1) as it only uses a constant amount of additional space.

# 6. Write a Python function named `get_unique_elements` that takes a list of elements and returns another list with unique elements.
