In this solution, we first sort the input list of numbers. Then we iterate through the sorted list and check the difference between each consecutive pair of numbers. If any difference is less than the given threshold, we return True immediately. If we reach the end of the list without finding a pair of numbers that are closer than the threshold, we return False.

This solution works by checking each pair of numbers in increasing order, which means it returns as soon as it finds a pair of numbers that are closer than the given threshold. It has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, and a space complexity of O(n) because we're creating a sorted copy of the input list.

Note: The function assumes that the input list of numbers is not empty. If that's not the case, you should add a check at the beginning of the function to handle that case.

Note: The function uses the built-in sort function, which sorts the elements in ascending order. If you want to sort the elements in descending order, you can pass the argument `reverse=True` to the sort function.

Note: The function assumes that the input list of numbers contains only float values. If that's not the case, you should add a check at the beginning of the function to handle that case.

Note: The function assumes that the input threshold is a positive float value. If that's not the case, you should add a check at the beginning of the function to handle that case.
