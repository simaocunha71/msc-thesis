The function find_zero tries to find a root of a polynomial using the Bisection Method. It starts by defining two initial guesses (x1 and x2) where one of them is negative and one is positive. The function then enters a loop where it calculates the value of the polynomial at x1 and x2, calculates the value of the polynomial at the midpoint of x1 and x2, and then checks if the value of the polynomial at the midpoint is zero or positive or negative. Depending on the result, the function updates x1 or x2 and continues the loop. The loop continues until the value of the polynomial at the midpoint is very close to zero.

Here is the Python code for the function find_zero:

```python
def find_zero(xs: list):
    # Initial guesses
    x1 = -1
    x2 = 1
    # Loop until the value of the polynomial at the midpoint is very close to zero
    while abs(poly(xs, (x1 + x2) / 2)) > 1e-6:
        # If the value of the polynomial at x1 is positive, update x1, else update x2
        if poly(xs, x1) > 0:
            x1 = (x1 + x2) / 2
        else:
            x2 = (x1 + x2) / 2
    # Return the midpoint of x1 and x2 as the root of the polynomial
    return (x1 + x2) / 2
```

This code assumes that the polynomial has at least one root in the interval [-1, 1]. If the polynomial has roots outside this interval, the function will not find them.

Also, the function poly is used in the find_zero function, so you need to define it before you can use find_zero.

The accuracy of the find_zero function can be controlled by changing the value of the threshold 1e-6 in the while loop. A smaller value will make the function more accurate but also more computationally intensive.
