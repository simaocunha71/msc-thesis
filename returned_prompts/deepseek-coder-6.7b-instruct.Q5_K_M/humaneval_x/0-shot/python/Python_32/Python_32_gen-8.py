Sure, here is the implementation of the function `find_zero`. This function uses the bisection method to find the roots of the polynomial.

```python
def find_zero(xs: list):
    assert len(xs) % 2 == 0, "Number of coefficients must be even"
    a, b = -1000, 1000
    while a < b:
        c = (a + b) / 2
        if poly(xs, c) < 0:
            a = c
        else:
            b = c
        if abs(poly(xs, c)) < 1e-6:
            return c
    return "No root found"
```

This function works by starting with an interval `[a, b]` where `poly(xs, a)` and `poly(xs, b)` have different signs. It then repeatedly bisects this interval and adjusts the interval so that `poly(xs, c)` has the same sign as `poly(xs, a)` for some `c` in the interval. This process continues until `poly(xs, c)` is close to zero or the interval becomes too small.

Please note that the accuracy of the result depends on the initial interval `[a, b]` and the precision `1e-6`. If these values are not suitable for your problem, you may need to adjust them. Also, the function assumes that the polynomial has at least one root in the interval `[a, b]`. If this is not the case, the function may not find the root or may get stuck in an infinite loop.
