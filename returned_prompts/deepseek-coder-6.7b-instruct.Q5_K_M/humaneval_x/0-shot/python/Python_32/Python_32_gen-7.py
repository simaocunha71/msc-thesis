Sure, I can do that.

Here is a Python code snippet that implements a binary search algorithm to find the root of a polynomial. It uses the secant method to find the root.

```python
def find_zero(xs: list, epsilon=0.0001):
    """
    xs are coefficients of a polynomial.
    find_zero find x such that poly(x) = 0.
    find_zero returns only only zero point, even if there are many.
    Moreover, find_zero only takes list xs having even number of coefficients
    and largest non zero coefficient as it guarantees
    a solution.
    """
    assert len(xs) % 2 == 0, "Number of coefficients should be even"
    assert xs[-1] != 0, "Last coefficient should not be zero"

    def poly(x):
        return sum(coeff * x**i for i, coeff in enumerate(xs))

    def secant_method(x0, x1):
        while abs(x1 - x0) > epsilon:
            x0, x1 = x1, x1 - (poly(x1) * (x1 - x0)) / (poly(x1) - poly(x0))
        return x1

    # Start with initial guesses of 0 and 1
    return secant_method(0, 1)
```

The secant method works by approximating the root of a function as the x-intercept of the line between the function and its tangent at the initial guess. The initial guesses are chosen to ensure convergence.

Please note that the secant method is not guaranteed to converge for all polynomials, especially those with multiple roots.

Also, the accuracy of the solution depends on the initial guesses and the precision of the epsilon value.

This code assumes that the polynomial has a root in the interval [0, 1]. If the polynomial has a root outside of this interval, you may need to adjust the initial guesses.

Also, the secant method is sensitive to the initial guesses, so it may not work well for all polynomials. In practice, you might need to use a different method or a library that supports root-finding.
