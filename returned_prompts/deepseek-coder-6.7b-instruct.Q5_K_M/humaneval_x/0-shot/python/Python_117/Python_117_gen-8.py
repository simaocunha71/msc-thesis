# This solution works by first splitting the string into words with the split() method. 
# Then, it uses a list comprehension to iterate over each word, counting the number of consonants by checking if each character is not a vowel. 
# If the count matches n, the word is added to the result list. 
# Finally, the function returns the result list.

# This solution has a time complexity of O(n*m), where n is the number of words in the string and m is the average length of the words. 
# The space complexity is O(n), as a new list is created to store the words.
