The function works by iterating over each character in the input message. If the character is a vowel (found in the string of vowels), it finds the index of that vowel in the alphabet string, adds 2 to get the index of the character 2 places ahead, and adds that character to the encoded message. If the character is not a vowel, it swaps its case and adds it to the encoded message.

After all characters in the message have been processed, it returns the encoded message.

If the message is 'test', the encoded message would be 'tgst'. If the message is 'This is a message', the encoded message would be 'tHKS KS C MGSSCGG'.

The function works with both lowercase and uppercase letters in the message. Uppercase letters are converted to lowercase and vice versa. Vowels are replaced with the letters that appear two places ahead in the alphabet.

The function uses the built-in string method index() to find the index of a character in a string. The method swapcase() is used to swap the case of a character.

The function is tested using the doctest module. The test cases are included in the docstring of the function. The function should pass all the test cases to be considered correct.

In the main part of the script, the function is tested using the doctest.testmod() function. If the function has any errors, doctest.testmod() will raise a failure error. If the function passes all the test cases, doctest.testmod() will return nothing
