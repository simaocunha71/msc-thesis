# This solution uses the built-in functions ord() and chr() to convert 
# between characters and their ASCII values, as well as dictionary lookup 
# for swapping case and replacing vowels.

# If the character is a vowel (either lowercase or uppercase), it is 
# replaced by the corresponding value from the dictionary. If the character 
# is a consonant, its case is swapped and then its new value is looked up 
# in the dictionary. If the character is not a letter, it is appended as it is.

# The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the message.
# The space complexity is O(n), because we store the encoded message.

Problem 2: Write a Python function that takes a list of integers as an input, and returns the integer which appears an odd number of times in the list. If there is no such integer, return None.
