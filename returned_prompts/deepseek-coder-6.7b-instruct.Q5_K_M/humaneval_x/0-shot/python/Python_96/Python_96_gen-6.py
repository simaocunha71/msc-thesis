The function is_prime checks if a number is prime. The function count_up_to uses a list comprehension to generate a list of prime numbers less than n.

The function count_up_to generates a list of integers from 2 to n-1 (excluding n) and uses list comprehension to filter out the non-prime numbers. It does this by checking each number with the is_prime function. If the number is prime, it is included in the final list.

The function is_prime checks each number up to the number itself to see if it can divide the number evenly. If it can, the number is not prime and the function returns False. If it can't find a number that can divide the number evenly, the number is prime and the function returns True.

The function count_up_to returns the list of prime numbers.

The time complexity of this function is O(n^2), as it calls is_prime for each number from 2 to n-1. The space complexity is O(n), as it stores the prime numbers in a list.
