# The function works by first checking if the array is empty. If it is, it returns the array as it is.
# If the array is not empty, it checks if the sum of the first and last elements of the array is even.
# If the sum is even, it sorts the array in descending order and returns it. If the sum is odd, it sorts the array in ascending order and returns it.
# The sorted() function returns a new sorted list from the elements of the given iterable. The sorted() function does not sort the elements of the iterable in-place.
# The sorted() function returns a new sorted list of elements in ascending order by default. We can modify this behavior by providing a key function to the sorted() function.
# The reverse=True argument in the sorted() function is used to sort the array in descending order.
# The sum() function returns the sum of all elements in the array.
# The % operator is used to get the remainder of the division of the sum of the first and last elements of the array by 2. If the remainder is 0, the sum is even. If the remainder is 1, the sum is odd.
# The return statement is used to return the sorted array from the function.
# The function is tested with different arrays to ensure it works as expected. The expected outputs are provided in the docstring of the function.
