# Time Complexity: O(nlogn) due to sorting
# Space Complexity: O(n) for new array

# The problem is about sorting an array based on a condition. The condition is if the sum of the first and last element is even, the array needs to be sorted in descending order. If the sum is odd, the array should be sorted in ascending order. The sorted function in python is used to sort the array. The time complexity is O(nlogn) as it uses Timsort which is a hybrid sorting algorithm derived from merge sort and insertion sort. The space complexity is O(n) as a new array is created to store the sorted elements.
