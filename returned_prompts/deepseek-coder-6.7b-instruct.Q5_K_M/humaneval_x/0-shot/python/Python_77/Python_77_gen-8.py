This function works by rounding the cube root of the given number to the nearest integer. This will be the smallest integer such that the cube of that integer is not less than the given number, and the cube of that integer is the absolute value of the given number. If the cube of the rounded cube root is equal to the absolute value of the given number, then the given number is a cube of some integer, and the function returns True. Otherwise, the function returns False.

Note that this function assumes that the input is always valid, which means that it does not handle cases where the input is not a number. If you need to handle such cases, you should add error checking code to the function.

Also, this function uses the built-in round function to round the cube root to the nearest integer. This will work correctly for positive numbers, but not for negative numbers. If you need to handle negative numbers, you should use the math.floor function instead of round, because the cube root of a negative number is a complex number. However, in this case, the given function works correctly for negative numbers too.
