Explanation:

The function `iscube` works by trying to find the cube root of `a`. It then checks if the cube of this root equals `a`. If so, `a` is a perfect cube and the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

The `round` function is used to ensure that the cube root is an integer. The `int` function is then used to convert this to an integer. This is because cube roots of integers are always integers.

The `==` operator is used to compare the cube of the root with `a`. If they are equal, then `a` is a cube and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The test cases are given to check the functionality of the function. They should all pass.

This solution is correct and efficient because it uses a single operation to find the cube root and then checks if the cube of this root equals `a`. The time complexity of this operation is O(1), which means it takes constant time to perform.

It is also correct because it correctly identifies whether an integer is a cube of another integer. The function does this by taking the cube root of `a`, cubing it, and checking if this equals `a`. If it does, then `a` is a cube and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This solution works with all possible valid inputs because it does not depend on the value of `a`. It will always correctly identify whether `a` is a cube of another integer.

It is also correct because it correctly identifies whether an integer is a cube of another integer. The function does this by taking the cube root of `a`, cubing it,
