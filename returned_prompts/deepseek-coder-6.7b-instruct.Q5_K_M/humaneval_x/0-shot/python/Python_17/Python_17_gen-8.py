# The function works by splitting the input string into a list of notes.
# Then it iterates over each note and appends the number of beats it lasts to the list beats.
# Finally, it returns the list of beats.


# This function works by assuming that the input string is correctly formatted and that all characters in the string are valid notes.
# If this is not the case, the function will not work correctly.
# Therefore, it's important to validate the input before calling this function.
# For example, you could add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure that all characters in the string are one of 'o', 'o|', and '.|'.
# If not, you could return an error message or handle the error in some other way that is appropriate for your program.


# This function works by assuming that each note in the string is separated by a space.
# If this is not the case, the function will not work correctly.
# Therefore, it's important to ensure that the input string is correctly formatted before calling this function.
# For example, you could add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure that there are no adjacent spaces in the string.
# If not, you could remove the spaces or handle the error in some other way that is appropriate for your program.


# The function works correctly for the given examples and the problem description.
# However, it might not work correctly for other inputs.
# Therefore, it's important to test the function with a variety of inputs to ensure that it
