# Answer: [4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4]

This solution works by splitting the input string into a list of notes, then iterating over that list. If a note is 'o', it appends 4 to the beats list. If it's 'o|', it appends 2. If it's '.|', it appends 1. Finally, it returns the beats list.

Note: This solution assumes that the input string is well-formed and does not contain any invalid characters. If it could contain invalid characters, you would need to add error checking code to handle those cases.

Note: This solution could be made more concise by using a dictionary to map the notes to their durations, but it was written this way to adhere to the problem statement's formatting.

Note: This solution could be made more efficient by not creating a new list for each note, but instead creating the list in one pass over the input string. However, this would make the solution more complex and harder to understand.
