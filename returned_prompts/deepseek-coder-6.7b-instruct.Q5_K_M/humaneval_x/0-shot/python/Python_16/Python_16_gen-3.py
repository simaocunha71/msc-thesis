```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    return len(set(string.lower()))
```

This function works by converting the input string to lowercase and then converting it to a set. A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements, so this effectively removes all duplicate characters from the string. The length of the set is then returned, which is the number of distinct characters in the string.

In the case of 'xyzXYZ', there are three unique characters: 'x', 'y', and 'z'. So the function returns 3.

In the case of 'Jerry', there are four unique characters: 'j', 'e', 'r', and 'y'. So the function returns 4.

This function assumes that the input string only contains alphabetic characters. If the input string contains non-alphabetic characters, the function may not work correctly.

Note: This function considers uppercase and lowercase letters as the same character. If you want to count uppercase and lowercase letters as different characters, you can remove the `.lower()` method.
