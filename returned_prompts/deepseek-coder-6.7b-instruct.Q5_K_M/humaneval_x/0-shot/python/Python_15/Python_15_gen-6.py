```python
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    return " ".join(str(i) for i in range(n+1))
```

This function uses the `range` function to generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to n (inclusive), converts each number to a string using a generator expression, and then joins these strings together with spaces in between.
