# This is a simple problem that can be solved by using the built-in function range() to generate a sequence of numbers, 
# then converting each number to a string and joining them together with spaces in between.

# This code will print out the string: '0 1 2 3 4 5' when called with the argument 5.
# If called with the argument 0, it will print out the string: '0'.
# For any other input, it will return a string with the numbers from 0 to that number inclusive, separated by spaces.

# The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the input number. This is because it needs to generate a sequence of n+1 numbers.
# The space complexity is also O(n) because it needs to store a string of n+1 numbers.
