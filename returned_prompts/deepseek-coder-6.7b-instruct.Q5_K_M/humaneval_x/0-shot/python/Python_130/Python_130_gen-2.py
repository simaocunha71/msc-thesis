This solution defines a function `tri` that generates the Tribonacci sequence up to the `n`th term. It first handles the base cases (n=0,1,2) separately. For all other cases, it initializes a list `t` with the base terms, and then iterates from 3 to `n` (inclusive). For each `i`, it checks if `i` is even. If it is, it adds `i // 2 + 1` to `t`. If `i` is odd, it adds `t[i-1] + t[i-2] + t[i+1]` to `t`. Finally, it returns `t`.

This solution uses a for loop to generate the sequence, which makes it time-consuming for large values of `n` because it has to compute each term in the sequence.

Please note that the Tribonacci sequence starts with 0,3,2. And the problem statement is a bit ambiguous in defining the sequence for odd numbers. In the example, the
