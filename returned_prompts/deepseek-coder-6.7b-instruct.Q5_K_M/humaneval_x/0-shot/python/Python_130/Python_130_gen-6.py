# This problem was solved by using a for loop and if else conditions to determine
# the Tribonacci sequence based on the given conditions. The loop runs from 2 to n
# and the conditions check if the previous number in the sequence is even or odd,
# which affects the calculation of the current number in the sequence. The sequence
# is stored in a list and returned at the end.
