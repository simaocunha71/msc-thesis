    def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
        strongest = extensions[0]
        max_strength = min(name.count(c) for c in 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ') - max(name.count(c) for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz')
        for extension in extensions:
            strength = min(extension.count(c) for c in 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ') - max(extension.count(c) for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz')
            if strength > max_strength:
                max_strength = strength
                strongest = extension
        return f'{class_name}.{strongest}'


    print(Strongest_Extension('Slices', ['SErviNGSliCes', 'Cheese', 'StuFfed']))
    print(Strongest_Extension('my_class', ['AA', 'Be', 'CC']))

This code uses the built-in count() function to count the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in the extension name. The strength is then calculated as the difference between the number of uppercase letters and lowercase letters. If the strength of the current extension is greater than the maximum strength found so far, the extension is updated and the maximum strength is updated. Finally, the function returns the class name followed by the strongest extension name in the format 'ClassName.StrongestExtensionName'.
