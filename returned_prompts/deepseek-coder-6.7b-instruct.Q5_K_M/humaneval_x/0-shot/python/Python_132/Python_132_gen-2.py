Explanation:
The function works by iterating through the string. If it encounters an opening bracket, it pushes it into a stack. If it encounters a closing bracket, it pops the last bracket from the stack. If it encounters a closing bracket and the stack is empty, it means there is no matching opening bracket, so it returns False. Finally, it checks if the stack is empty after going through the string. If it's not, that means there are unpaired opening brackets, so it returns False. If it is empty, it means there are no unpaired brackets, so it returns True.

This function works for all cases because it checks for valid subsequences of brackets, not just the whole string. It also works by keeping track of the opening brackets it encounters and the closing brackets it encounters, so it can determine if there is a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket is nested.
