The function works by maintaining a stack of open brackets. When it encounters an open bracket, it pushes it onto the stack. When it encounters a close bracket, it checks if the stack is not empty, if so it pops the top element from the stack. If the stack is empty, it means there is no matching opening bracket for this closing bracket, so it returns False. If the stack is empty after traversing the string, it means all brackets were correctly nested, so it returns True.

This solution assumes that the input string is only made of square brackets. If there can be other characters in the string, the function needs to be modified accordingly.

This solution also assumes that the input string is well-formed, meaning it has a correct number of opening and closing brackets. If the string can be malformed, the function needs to be modified to handle those cases.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string, and the space complexity is O(n) in the worst case when all brackets are open.

The solution is not optimal because it requires traversing the entire string and using additional space to store the open brackets. However, it is a straightforward solution that works for the given problem.

If performance is a concern, a more optimized solution would involve a single pass through the string without using additional space, but it would require more complex code.
