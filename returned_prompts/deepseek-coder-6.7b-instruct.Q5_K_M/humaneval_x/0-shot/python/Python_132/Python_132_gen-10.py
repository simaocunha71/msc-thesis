Explanation:

The function is_nested iterates through the string, adding each '[' to the stack. 
If it encounters a ']', it checks if there is a matching '[' on the top of the stack. 
If there is, it removes the '[' from the stack. If it doesn't find a matching '[' for a ']', 
it immediately returns False. If it goes through the entire string without finding a ']' without 
a matching '[', it returns True only if the stack is empty. This means every '[' has a corresponding ']', 
so the string is correctly nested. Otherwise, there is a '[' that isn't closed, so it's not correctly nested.

This solution uses a stack data structure to solve the problem. Stacks are a type of data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last item added to the stack is the first one to be removed. This makes it ideal for this problem, as it allows us to check for nested brackets in a very efficient way.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because we are iterating through the string once. The space complexity is also O(n), in the worst case scenario where we have to store all the brackets in the stack. This happens when the string is not correctly nested.

The function is_nested is not a perfect solution for
