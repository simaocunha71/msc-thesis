Explanation:

This solution uses a stack data structure to keep track of the brackets in the string. It iterates over the string and for each bracket it encounters, it pushes it onto the stack if it's an opening bracket and pops it off the stack if it's a closing bracket. If the stack is empty when we encounter a closing bracket, that means there is no matching opening bracket for this closing bracket, so we return False. At the end of the string, if the stack is not empty, that means there are unclosed brackets left, so we return True.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) where n is the length of the string, and the space complexity is also O(n) because in the worst case scenario we could end up pushing all the brackets onto the stack.

The function works by iterating through the string. If it encounters an opening bracket, it adds it to the stack. If it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty or the last item on the stack is not an opening bracket. If either of these conditions are true, it returns False. If the stack is not empty at the end of the string, it means there are unmatched opening brackets, so it returns True.
