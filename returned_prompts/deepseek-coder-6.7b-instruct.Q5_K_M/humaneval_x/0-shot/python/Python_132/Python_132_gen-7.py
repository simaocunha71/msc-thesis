# Explanation:
# In the first test case, '[[]]' is a valid subsequence with a nested bracket at the second position.
# In the second test case, no valid subsequence of brackets contains a nested bracket.
# In the third test case, no valid subsequence of brackets contains a nested bracket.
# In the fourth test case, no valid subsequence of brackets contains a nested bracket.
# In the fifth test case, '[[][]]' is a valid subsequence with a nested bracket at the second position.
# In the sixth test case, '[[]][[' is a valid subsequence with a nested bracket at the second position.

# Note: This solution assumes that the input string is well-formed, i.e., it contains only square brackets.
# If the input string can contain unbalanced brackets, then the solution should be modified accordingly.

This problem can be solved by using a stack data structure. The idea is to push each opening bracket into the stack and whenever a closing bracket is encountered, check if the top of the stack contains an opening bracket. If it does, then we have found a valid subsequence of brackets. 

Finally, if the stack is empty and there is at least one nested bracket in the string, then return True. Otherwise, return False.
