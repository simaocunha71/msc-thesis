Note:
The eval() function in python can be very dangerous because it can execute any arbitrary code.
This function is used here in a controlled environment, and the operand lists are carefully controlled 
to only contain integers and the operators are restricted to the ones specified in the problem.
Therefore, it's safe to use eval() here.
