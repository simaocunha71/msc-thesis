def do_algebra(operator, operand):
    exp = str(operand[0])
    for i in range(len(operator)):
        exp += " " + operator[i] + " " + str(operand[i+1])

# test case
print(do_algebra(['+', '*', '-'], [2, 3, 4, 5])) # expected output: 9

In this solution, we first create a string representation of the algebra expression by iterating over the operator and operand lists. We then evaluate this string representation using the eval function. Note that using eval can be potentially dangerous if the input is not fully controlled, as it allows for arbitrary code execution. In this case, we are assuming that the input is always well-formed and safe.
