def eat(number, need, remaining):
    if need > remaining:
        return [number + remaining, 0]
    else:
        return [number + need, remaining - need]

print(eat(5, 6, 10))  # -> [11, 4]
print(eat(4, 8, 9))  # -> [12, 1]
print(eat(1, 10, 10))  # -> [11, 0]
print(eat(2, 11, 5))  # -> [7, 0]

The solution first checks if the need is greater than the remaining carrots. If it is, it returns the total number of eaten carrots as the sum of the initial number of eaten carrots and the remaining carrots, and the number of carrots left as 0. If the need is less than or equal to the remaining carrots, it returns the total number of eaten carrots as the sum of the initial number of eaten carrots and the need, and the number of carrots left as the difference between the remaining carrots and the need.
