print(eat(5, 6, 10))  # [11, 4]
print(eat(4, 8, 9))  # [12, 1]
print(eat(1, 10, 10))  # [11, 0]
print(eat(2, 11, 5))  # [7, 0]

# In this solution, I first check if there are enough remaining carrots to satisfy the need.
# If there are, I return the total number of eaten carrots and the number of left carrots after eating.
# If not, I return the total number of eaten carrots and 0 as the number of left carrots after eating.
