"""
In this function, we are given the number of carrots already eaten, the need of carrots, and the remaining number of carrots in stock. If the remaining number of carrots is greater than or equal to the need, we eat the need amount, otherwise we eat all the remaining carrots and the remaining number of carrots is set to 0. The total number of eaten carrots is the sum of the number of carrots eaten and the remaining carrots in stock.
