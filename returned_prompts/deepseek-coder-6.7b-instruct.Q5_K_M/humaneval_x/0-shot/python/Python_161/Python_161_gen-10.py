The solution uses the built-in Python functions isalpha(), swapcase() and [::-1] to solve the problem. The function first checks if the string contains only letters with isalpha() function. If it does, swapcase() function is used to reverse the case of the string. If it does not contain letters, [::-1] is used to reverse the string.

The solution takes into consideration all possible cases, including when the string contains numbers, special characters and letters in mixed case.

The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string, because we have to iterate over the string once to check if it contains letters. The space complexity is also O(n) because we create a new string with the same characters as the input string.

Note: The built-in Python functions swapcase() and [::-1] are used to reverse the case and the string respectively. The isalpha() function is used to check if the string contains only letters. If it does, the function returns the string with the case reversed; otherwise, it returns the string reversed.
