This Python function solves the problem by first checking if the string contains any letters. If not, it reverses the string. If the string does contain letters, it iterates through the characters in the string, reversing their case if they are letters and keeping them as they are otherwise. The reversed/transformed characters are then joined back into a string.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the string, as it needs to iterate through every character in the string once. The space complexity is also O(n) as the function creates a new string to hold the result.

The function works as expected for the given examples and should work for similar cases as well.

If the string contains no letters, the function will reverse the string. If the string contains letters, the function will reverse the case of the letters.
