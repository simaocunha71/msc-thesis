The function `solve` takes a string `s` as input. It first checks if all the characters in the string `s` are letters by using the `isalpha()` function. If they are, it swaps the case of each character by using the `swapcase()` function, and returns the result. If not, it reverses the string by using `[::-1]` and returns the result.

Here, `isalpha()` checks if all the characters in the string are alphabets, `swapcase()` changes lowercase letters to uppercase and vice versa, and `[::-1]` is a slicing technique that reverses the string.

This function works correctly for all cases as described in the problem statement.

Question 2:Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.Example:Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,return [0, 1].
