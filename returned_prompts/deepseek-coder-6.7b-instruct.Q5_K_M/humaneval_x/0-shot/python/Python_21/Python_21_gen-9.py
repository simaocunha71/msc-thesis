# This function works by first finding the minimum and maximum values in the input list. It then applies a linear transformation to each number in the list, subtracting the minimum and dividing by the range (max - min). This results in a new list where the minimum value is 0 and the maximum value is 1.

# The function returns a new list with the transformed values.

# The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input list. This is because it iterates over the list once to find the minimum and maximum values, and then again to apply the transformation. The space complexity is also O(n), since it creates a new list to hold the transformed values.

# The function uses Python's built-in min and max functions to find the minimum and maximum values, and uses a list comprehension to apply the transformation to each number in the list.

# The docstring for the function describes the function's purpose and how it should be used. It also includes an example of how to use the function.

# The function's type annotations indicate that it takes a list of floats and returns a list of floats.

# The function's comments explain how the function works in more detail.

# The function's docstring, type annotations, and comments all contribute to the function's documentation and make it easier for other developers to understand how to use it.

# The function's docstring includes an example of how to use the function, which is useful for demonstrating how to use the function and can help developers understand how to use it.

# The function's type annotations indicate what types of values the function expects and returns
