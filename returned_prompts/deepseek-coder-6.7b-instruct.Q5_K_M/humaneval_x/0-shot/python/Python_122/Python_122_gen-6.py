# This code works by iterating through the first k elements of the array and checking if each element is at most two digits long (i.e., less than or equal to 99). If the element meets this condition, it is added to the sum. The function then returns the sum.

# When running this code with the given example, it will output 24, which is the sum of the first four elements (21 and 3) of the array that are at most two digits long.

# The time complexity of this solution is O(k), where k is the number of elements to consider. The space complexity is O(1), as it only uses a single variable to keep track of the sum.

# It is important to note that this problem assumes that the input array only contains positive integers, as it does not specify how to handle negative numbers or non-integer values.
