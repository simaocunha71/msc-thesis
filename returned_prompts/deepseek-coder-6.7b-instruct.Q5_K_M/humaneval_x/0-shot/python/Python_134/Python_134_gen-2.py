This function works by checking if the last character of the input string is an alphabetical character and if the character before it is a space. If both conditions are true, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

In Python, the negative indexing is used to access the elements from the end of the list. So, txt[-1] gives the last element and txt[-2] gives the second last element. The function isalpha() checks whether the string consists of alphabetic characters only.

The condition txt[-2] == ' ' is added to ensure that the last character is not a part of a word. If it's a part of a word, the function should return False.

If the string is empty, the function should return False as well.

In the given examples, the last character of the string is a letter and it is not a part of a word, so the function should return True.

The function is case sensitive, meaning it will treat lower case and upper case letters as different.

I hope this helps to understand the function.

Note: The problem statement is a bit ambiguous. It seems that the last character should be a space, not a letter, to return True. So, in the examples, the word "apple" is followed by a space, so the function returns True. If you want the function to return True only if the last character is a letter and not a part of a word, you should remove the condition txt[-2] == ' '.

Let me know if you need help with anything else.
