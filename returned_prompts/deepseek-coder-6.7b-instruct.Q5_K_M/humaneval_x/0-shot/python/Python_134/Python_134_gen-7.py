# It checks if the last character is an alphabetical character and if it's not a part of a word,
# which is determined by checking if the character before it is a space.
# If the string is empty, it returns False.
# This solution assumes that words are separated by spaces and that there are no other special characters.
# It also assumes that the string does not contain any other whitespace characters.

# This solution works by checking the last character of the string, and if it is not a letter, it checks the character before it.
# If the character before the last one is a space, it means that the last character is not part of a word and it returns True.
# If the character before the last one is not a space, it means that the last character is part of a word and it returns False.
# If the string is empty, it returns False.

# This solution has a time complexity of O(1) and a space complexity of O(1), as it only needs to check a fixed number of characters in the string.
# It should work for all inputs as long as the string does not contain any other whitespace characters.
# If the string contains other whitespace characters, the solution may not work correctly.

# The solution assumes that words are separated by spaces and that there are no other special characters.
# If these assumptions are not correct, the solution may not work correctly.
