This solution works by checking if the last character of the string is an alphabetical letter and if it is not a part of a word. It does this by using the isalpha() method to check if the last character is a letter and by finding the last space in the string and comparing the index of the last space to the index of the last character. If they are different, it means the last character is not a part of a word.

The function also handles the case where the string is empty by returning False. It also handles the case where there is only one word in the string by checking if the first character is a letter and if the last character is not a space.

Finally, it handles the case where there are multiple words in the string and the last word is a single letter by checking if the last character is a letter and if the character before the last space is not the same as the last character.

I hope this helps clarify the solution. Let me know if you have any questions.
