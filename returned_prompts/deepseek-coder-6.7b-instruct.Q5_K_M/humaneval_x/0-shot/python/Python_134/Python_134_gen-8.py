    if txt == "":
        return False
    if txt[-1].isalpha() and txt[-2] == " ":
        return True
    else:
        return False

print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pie")) # False
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e")) # True
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e  ")) # False
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("")) # False

This solution works by checking if the last character is a letter and if the character before it is a space. This indicates that it is not a part of a word. If these conditions are met, the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

Another simpler way to solve this problem is by using the `split()` function to get a list of words, and then check if the last character of the last word is a letter. Here is the code:

```python
def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):
    words = txt.split()
    if words:
        return words[-1][-1].isalpha()
    else:
        return False
```

This solution works by splitting the input string into words, and then checking if the last character of the last word is a letter. If it is, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

In both solutions, we first handle the edge case where the input string is empty by returning False.

Both solutions have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string.

This solution is correct and efficient.

In summary, the solution for this problem is simple and effective. It uses the `isalpha()` function to check if the last character is a letter, and the `split()` function to split the input string into words.
