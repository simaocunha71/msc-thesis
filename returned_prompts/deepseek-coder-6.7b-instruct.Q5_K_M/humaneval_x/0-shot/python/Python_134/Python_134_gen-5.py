This function works by checking if the last character of the input string is an alphabetical character (using the `isalpha()` method), and if the character before it is a space (`txt[-2] == ' '`). If both conditions are met, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Note that the function assumes that there is at least one character in the string.

The function also handles the case where the string ends with a space by checking if the second to last character is a space before deciding whether the last character is a letter or not. This handles the case where the string ends with a space, such as "apple pi e ".

The function will return `False` for an empty string as there is no character to check.

The function is case sensitive, meaning it treats lower case and upper case letters as different characters. If you want the function to ignore case, you can modify the function to convert the string to lower case or upper case before checking if the last character is a letter.
