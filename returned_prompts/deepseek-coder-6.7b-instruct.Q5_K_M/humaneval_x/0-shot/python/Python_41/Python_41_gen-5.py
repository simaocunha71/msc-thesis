The function `car_race_collision` takes in a single integer `n`, which represents the number of cars on either side of the road. The function creates two lists, `left_cars` and `right_cars`, representing the cars moving in opposite directions. Then, it iterates through the lists, comparing corresponding elements. If the elements are equal, it increments the `collisions` counter. Finally, it returns the `collisions` count.
