The function car_race_collision counts the number of collisions between cars moving in opposite directions. The cars are represented by integers, where i represents the position of the ith car and i < j represents that the ith car is to the left of the jth car. The function counts each pair of cars that are moving towards each other (i < j).

The time complexity of this function is O(n^2) because there are n*(n-1)/2 pairs of cars to check. The space complexity is O(1) because the function only uses a constant amount of space to store the count of collisions.

This function assumes that the input is a positive integer. If the input could be negative or not an integer, additional error checking would be needed.

# In the first example, there are 3 pairs of cars that will collide: (0, 1), (0, 2), and (1, 2).
# In the second example, there are 6 pairs of cars that will collide: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), and (2, 3).
