The function `histogram` first creates an empty dictionary `letter_counts`. Then it splits the input string into words (letters in this case) and counts the occurrences of each letter. The `max_count` is determined by finding the maximum value in `letter_counts`. The function finally returns a dictionary that contains only the letters and their counts that match the `max_count`. If `letter_counts` is empty (i.e., the input string is empty), `max_count` is 0 and the returned dictionary will be empty.

The use of `max` function with `values()` method to get the maximum count and `items()` method to get the key-value pairs of `letter_counts` dictionary is a common idiom in Python. It is equivalent to iterating over `letter_counts` items and comparing the counts.

The `split` method splits the input string into words (letters in this case). It separates the string into words based on spaces. If no argument is provided, it splits on whitespace characters (tabs, newlines, spaces).

The `if` condition with the `for` loop is a common idiom in Python. It checks whether a key is in a dictionary and performs an action if it is not.
