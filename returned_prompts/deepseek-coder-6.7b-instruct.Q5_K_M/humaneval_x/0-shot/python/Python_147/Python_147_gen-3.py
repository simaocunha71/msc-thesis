Question 3: Minimum Number of Operations to Convert TimeGiven two strings representing the current time and the final time, calculate the minimum number of operations needed to convert the current time to the final time. An operation can either be an increment of one minute, an increment of one hour, or an increment of one second.Note: You may assume the inputs are well-formed and always valid.
