This solution works by first calculating the values of a, then for each possible triple of indices i, j, k, it checks if the sum of a[i], a[j], and a[k] is a multiple of 3. If it is, it increments the counter. The final result is the total count of such triples.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^3), which is because there are three nested loops over n elements each.

The space complexity is O(n), because the array a of length n is used to store the computed values.

Note: This solution is not very efficient for large values of n, as it has a high time complexity. It could be optimized by precomputing the values of a and storing them in a lookup table, or by using dynamic programming to avoid recomputing the values of a.

Another optimization can be done by using mathematical properties of the given formula of a[i] (i*i - i + 1). The sum of three numbers is a multiple of 3 if and only if at least two of them are. So we can count the number of values of a that are multiples of 3, and then use combinations to get the number of valid triples.

This would be a more efficient solution, with a time complexity of O(n).

Here is a possible implementation of this optimized solution:
