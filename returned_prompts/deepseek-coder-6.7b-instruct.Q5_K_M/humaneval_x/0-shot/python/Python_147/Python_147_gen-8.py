    return count

print(get_max_triples(5))

# Output: 1

Explanation: 
The array 'a' is [1, 3, 7, 13, 21]. The only valid triple is (1, 7, 13) because 1 + 7 + 13 = 22, which is not a multiple of 3. Therefore, the output is 1.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^3) because of the three nested loops. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the array 'a'.

Please note that the solution might not be efficient for large values of 'n'. The time complexity of this solution is O(n^3) which is quite high. You might need to consider a more efficient approach for larger inputs.

Problem 2:Given an array of integers, write a function that returns the number of pairs of indices (i, j) such that the absolute difference between the elements at positions i and j is at least k. For example, if the array is [1, 5, 3, 7] and k is 3, the function should return 2 because there are two pairs of indices (0, 2) and (1, 3) where the absolute difference between the elements is at least 3.
