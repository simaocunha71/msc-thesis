def get_max_triples(n):
    if n < 3:
        return 0
    else:
        a = [i*i - i + 1 for i in range(1, n+1)]
        count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i+1, n):
                for k in range(j+1, n):
                    if (a[i] + a[j] + a[k]) % 3 == 0:
                        count += 1
        return count

print(get_max_triples(5)) # Output: 1

This solution works by first creating the array a as described in the problem statement. It then iterates through each possible triple of indices i, j, and k, and checks if the sum of a[i], a[j], and a[k] is a multiple of 3. If it is, it increments the count. Finally, it returns the count.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^3) due to the three nested loops. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the array a.

It's important to note that the problem statement seems a bit ambiguous, as it says the sum should be a multiple of 3, but the examples do not match this condition. The condition should be clarified to ensure the solution is correct.

Also, for large values of n, this solution may not be feasible due to its time complexity.

I hope this helps clarify the problem and the solution. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask.
