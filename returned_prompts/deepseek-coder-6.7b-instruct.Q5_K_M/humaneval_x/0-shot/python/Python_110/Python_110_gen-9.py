In this code, we first find all the odd numbers in lst1 and even numbers in lst2. If the number of odd numbers in lst1 is less than or equal to the number of even numbers in lst2, we return "YES". Otherwise, we return "NO".

This is because we can make lst1 all even by exchanging odd numbers from lst1 and even numbers from lst2. If the number of odd numbers in lst1 is greater than the number of even numbers in lst2, it will be impossible to make all numbers in lst1 even.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the length of the input lists.
