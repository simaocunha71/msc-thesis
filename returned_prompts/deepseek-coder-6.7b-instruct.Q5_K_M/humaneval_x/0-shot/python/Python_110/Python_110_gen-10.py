def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    odd1 = [x for x in lst1 if x%2 != 0]
    even2 = [x for x in lst2 if x%2 == 0]
    if len(odd1) > len(even2):
        return "NO"
    else:
        return "YES"

print(exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]))  # => "YES"
print(exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]))  # => "NO"

In this code, we first create two lists: odd1, which contains all the odd numbers from lst1, and even2, which contains all the even numbers from lst2. If the length of odd1 (which contains all the odd numbers from lst1) is greater than the length of even2 (which contains all the even numbers from lst2), we return "NO" because it's not possible to make lst1 contain only even numbers by exchanging elements between lst1 and lst2. If the length of odd1 is not greater than the length of even2, we return "YES" because it's possible to make lst1 contain only even numbers by exchanging elements between lst1 and lst2.
