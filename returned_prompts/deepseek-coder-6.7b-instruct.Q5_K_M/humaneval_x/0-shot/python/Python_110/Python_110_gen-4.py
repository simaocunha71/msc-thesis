def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    odd_in_lst1 = sum(x % 2 != 0 for x in lst1)
    even_in_lst2 = sum(x % 2 == 0 for x in lst2)
    return "YES" if odd_in_lst1 <= even_in_lst2 else "NO"

print(exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]))  # "YES"
print(exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]))  # "NO"

In this solution, we first count the number of odd numbers in lst1 and even numbers in lst2. If there are more odd numbers in lst1 than even numbers in lst2, it means we can exchange the odd numbers from lst1 with even numbers from lst2 to make all numbers in lst1 even. Thus we return "YES". Otherwise, we return "NO".

This solution works by counting the number of odd and even numbers in each list, and then comparing these counts. The count of odd numbers in lst1 and even numbers in lst2 are compared to see if it's possible to make all numbers in lst1 even by exchanging numbers between lst1 and lst2.
