Explanation:

The function works by first creating a list of odd numbers in lst1 and a list of even numbers in lst2. Then it checks if the number of odd numbers in lst1 is less than or equal to the number of even numbers in lst2. If it is, then it means we can exchange numbers between lst1 and lst2 to make all numbers in lst1 even. If it is not, then it means we cannot make all numbers in lst1 even.

In the first example, we have 2 odd numbers in lst1 ([1, 3]) and 2 even numbers in lst2 ([1, 3]), so we can make all numbers in lst1 even by exchanging 1 from lst2 to lst1 and 3 from lst1 to lst2.

In the second example, we have 2 odd numbers in lst1 ([1, 3]) and no even numbers in lst2 ([1, 5, 3, 4]), so we cannot make all numbers in lst1 even.
