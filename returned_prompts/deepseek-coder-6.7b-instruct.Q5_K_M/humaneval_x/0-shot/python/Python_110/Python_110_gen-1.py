    odd_lst1 = [num for num in lst1 if num % 2 != 0]
    even_lst2 = [num for num in lst2 if num % 2 == 0]

    if len(odd_lst1) <= len(even_lst2):
        return "YES"
    else:
        return "NO"


# Test the function
print(exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]))  # => "YES"
print(exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]))  # => "NO"


# The function works by first creating a list of odd numbers in lst1 and a list of even numbers in lst2.
# Then it checks if the number of odd numbers in lst1 is less than or equal to the number of even numbers in lst2.
# If it is, it means it's possible to exchange elements to make all numbers in lst1 to be even, so it returns "YES".
# Otherwise, it's not possible, so it returns "NO".
