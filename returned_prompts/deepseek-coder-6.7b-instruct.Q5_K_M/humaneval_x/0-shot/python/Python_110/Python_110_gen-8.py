def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    odd_lst1 = [x for x in lst1 if x % 2 != 0]
    even_lst2 = [x for x in lst2 if x % 2 == 0]
    if len(odd_lst1) > len(even_lst2):
        return "NO"
    else:
        return "YES"

print(exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]))  # => "YES"
print(exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]))  # => "NO"

In this code, I first created two lists - one for the odd numbers in lst1 and one for the even numbers in lst2.
Then I just compared the lengths of these lists.
If there are more odd numbers in lst1 than even numbers in lst2, it's not possible to convert all the odd numbers in lst1 to even, so I return "NO".
Otherwise, it's possible, so I return "YES".
