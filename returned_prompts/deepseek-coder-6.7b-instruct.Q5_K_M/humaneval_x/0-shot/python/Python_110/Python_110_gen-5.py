Explanation:

The function exchange takes two lists, lst1 and lst2. It first creates a list odd1 that contains all the odd numbers from lst1. Then it creates a list even2 that contains all the even numbers from lst2.
If the number of odd numbers in lst1 is greater than the number of even numbers in lst2, it returns "NO". This means that it is not possible to exchange numbers from lst1 and lst2 to make all numbers in lst1 even.
Otherwise, it returns "YES". This means that it is possible to exchange numbers from lst1 and lst2 to make all numbers in lst1 even.

This solution works by first creating two lists: odd_in_lst
