def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    return len(string)


print(strlen(''))
print(strlen('abc'))


# In python, the len() function is used to find the length of a string.
# The function returns the number of characters in the string.
# So, I have just reused this function.

# The type hinting in function signature is just for better understanding of what the function is expected to do. It is not mandatory and can be omitted.
