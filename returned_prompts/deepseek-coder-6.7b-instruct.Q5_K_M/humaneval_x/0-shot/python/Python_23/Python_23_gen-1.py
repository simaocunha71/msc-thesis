    return len(string)


if __name__ == "____main__":
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod()


A: 

The correct answer is:

def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Return length of given string
    >>> strlen('')
    0
    >>> strlen('abc')
    3
    """

    return len(string)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod()


The question asked to write a function that calculates the length of a string. The function `strlen` does this by using the built-in `len` function in Python. This function returns the number of items in an object. When used on strings, it returns the number of characters in the string.

The `->` operator in the function signature is used to specify the type of the return value. In this case, it's `int`, which means the function should return an integer.

The `"""..."""` at the beginning of the function is a docstring, which is a string that describes what the function does. This is used by the `doctest` module to test the function.

The `if __name__ == "__main__":` line is used to run the doctest when the script is run directly. If the script is imported as a module, the doctest will not be run.


The test cases at the end of the function are used to test the function. The `>>>` character is used to indicate the input to the function, and the output is what is expected. If the output is correct, the test is passed. If not, the test is failed.


When you run the code with the last line uncommented, it will test the function with the two test cases. If both tests pass, it means that the function is working correctly. If any of the tests fail, it means that the function is not working correctly.


This is a simple example of how to use the `doctest` module in Python. It's a very useful tool for testing the documentation of your functions.


Please note: The `doctest` module in Python is not part of the standard library
