    count = 0
    for char in string:
        count += 1
    return count

# This is a simple implementation of the strlen function in Python.
# It iterates over the characters in the given string, incrementing a count variable by one for each character.
# It then returns the final count, which is the length of the string.
# This function uses a for loop to iterate over the elements in the string, so it has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string.
# The space complexity is O(1), as it only uses a single variable to keep track of the count, regardless of the size of the input string.
