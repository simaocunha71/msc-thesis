Explanation:

The function `even_odd_palindrome(n)` takes a positive integer n and returns a tuple that has the number of even and odd integer palindromes that fall within the range(1, n), inclusive.

The helper function `is_palindrome(num)` checks whether a given number is a palindrome by converting it to a string and comparing it with its reverse.

The function then counts the number of even and odd palindromes within the range by iterating over the numbers in the range (1, n+1) and checking if each number is a palindrome and whether it is even or odd using the modulo operator.

Finally, the function returns a tuple with the counts of even and odd palindromes.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the input number, since we are iterating over the range(1, n+1) once. The space complexity is O(1), as we are only using a fixed amount of space to store the counts of even and odd palindromes.


Note: This solution assumes that by "odd palindrome", you mean palindromes that are odd numbers, not the odd numbers in the palindrome. If you mean the latter, the problem is not well defined as there are infinite odd numbers which are palindromes.
