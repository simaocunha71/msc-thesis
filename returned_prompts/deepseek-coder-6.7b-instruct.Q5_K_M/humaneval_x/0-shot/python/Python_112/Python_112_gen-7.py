def reverse_delete(s,c):
    for ch in c:
        s = s.replace(ch, '')
    return (s[::-1], s == s[::-1])

# Test cases
print(reverse_delete("abcde", "ae"))  # should return ('bcd', False)
print(reverse_delete("abcdef", "b"))  # should return ('acdef', False)
print(reverse_delete("abcdedcba", "ab"))  # should return ('cdedc', True)

# The function `reverse_delete` works by first replacing all instances of characters in `c` in `s` with nothing, effectively deleting those characters.
# It then returns a tuple with the reversed string `s` and a boolean indicating whether `s` is a palindrome.
# A string is considered a palindrome if it reads the same forwards and backwards, so `s == s[::-1]` checks this condition.
