In this code, we are just slicing the list from the second element onwards and returning it as the derivative. This is because in a polynomial, the derivative of a term 'ax^n' is 'n*ax^(n-1)', so the coefficient of the derivative is 'n*a'. Thus, the list of coefficients of the derivative is the same length as the original list but starting at index 1 (the second element).

The function `derivative` returns a tuple of two lists. The first list is the coefficients of the derivative, and the second list is the powers of x for each term in the derivative.

Please note that this code assumes that the input list is always a valid polynomial. If the input list may not always be a valid polynomial, you should add error checking to the function to handle invalid inputs.
