# The function is returning the coefficients of the derivative polynomial and the original list of coefficients (which is not a derivative). I am assuming the original list is in a format where the first element is the constant term, the second is the coefficient of x, the third is the coefficient of x^2 and so on. If the format is different, the function needs to be adjusted accordingly.
