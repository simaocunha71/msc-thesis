    return [numbers[i] for i in sorted([i for i in arr if 1 <= i <= 9])[::-1]]

print(by_length([2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3]))  # ["Eight", "Five", "Four", "Three", "Two", "Two", "One", "One"]

This solution first creates a dictionary for the numbers between 1 and 9 inclusive. It then uses list comprehension to sort the array, excluding the numbers outside the range, reverse it, and replace each number with its corresponding word.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, and the space complexity is O(n) for storing the result.

In the worst case scenario, the array is sorted and reversed in-place, so the space complexity is O(1) if not considering the output.

In the best case scenario, the array is already sorted, so the time complexity is O(n), and the space complexity is O(n) for storing the result.

In the average case scenario, the array is sorted, but it's not sorted in-place, so the space complexity is O(n).
