    In this function, we iterate over each element of the list x. For each element,
    we convert it to a string, and then iterate over each digit of the string. If 
    any digit is even (i.e., if the remainder when dividing by 2 is 0), we discard 
    the number from the list. If no even digits are found, the number is kept.

    This solution has a time complexity of O(n*m) where n is the number of elements 
    in the list x and m is the average number of digits in the numbers in x. 
    This is because we are iterating over each element in x and then over each digit 
    in each element. The space complexity is O(n) because we are storing the 
    elements in a new list.
