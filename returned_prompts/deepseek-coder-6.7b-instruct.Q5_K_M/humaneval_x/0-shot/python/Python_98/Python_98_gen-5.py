    for i in range(0, len(s), 2):
        if s[i] in vowels:

print(count_upper('aBCdEf'))  # returns 1
print(count_upper('abcdefg'))  # returns 0
print(count_upper('dBBE'))  # returns 0
print(count_upper('bAEcD'))  # returns 1
print(count_upper('ABCDE'))  # returns 2

Explanation:

The function count_upper takes a string s as input. It initializes a count variable to 0. It then iterates over the string at even indices (0, 2, 4, etc.) and checks if each character is an uppercase vowel. If it is, it increments the count. Finally, it returns the count.

The function is tested with a string 'aBCdEf' where 1 uppercase vowel 'E' at even index '4' is found. The string 'abcdefg' contains no uppercase vowels and the string 'dBBE' contains one uppercase vowel 'B' at even index '2'. The string 'bAEcD' contains one uppercase vowel 'E' at even index '4'. The string 'ABCDE' contains two uppercase vowels 'A' and 'E' at even indices '0' and '4'.

Exercise 2: String manipulationWrite a Python function that takes two strings s1 and s2 as input and returns a new string which is the result of merging s1 and s2 by taking one character from s1 and one from s2 alternatively until the strings end. If one string is longer than the other, append the remaining characters of the longer string to the end of the result.For example:merge_strings('abc', '1234') returns 'a1b2c4'merge_strings('abcd', '123') returns 'a1b2c3d'merge_strings('1234', 'abc') returns '1a2
