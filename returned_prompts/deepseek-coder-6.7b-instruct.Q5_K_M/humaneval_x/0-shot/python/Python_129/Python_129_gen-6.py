    ## First of all we need to flatten the grid into a 1D list and sort it
    flattened_grid = sorted([item for sublist in grid for item in sublist])
    ## Initialize a list to store the path
    path = []
    ## Initialize the minimum path as the flattened grid
    min_path = flattened_grid[:k]

        ## Check the path for each possible path
        temp_path = flattened_grid[:k] + flattened_grid[i - (k - 1) : i + 1]
        ## If the path is smaller than the current minimum path, update it
        if temp_path < min_path:

print(minPath([[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]], 3))
print(minPath([[5,9,3], [4,1,6], [7,8,2]], 1))

## The time complexity of the solution is O(N^2 log N) where N is the size of the grid, as it involves sorting the flattened grid and the checking of each possible path. The space complexity is O(N) as it stores the flattened grid and the path.

Problem 2: Minimum Number of Swaps to Arrange a Binary Grid (15 min)A binary grid is an N x N grid whose elements are either 0 or 1. A group of cells is said to be connected if there is a path from any cell to any other cell in the group by moving only right or down. Two groups are said to be connected if there is a path from any cell in the first group to any cell in the second group.Given a binary grid, return the minimum number of swaps required to make the grid become connected.Note: You can swap any two cells (i, j) and (k, l) if and only
