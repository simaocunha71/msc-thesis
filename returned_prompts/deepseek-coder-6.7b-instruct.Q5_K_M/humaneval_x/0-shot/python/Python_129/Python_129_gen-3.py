Explanation:

This is a depth-first search (DFS) problem where you are trying to find the minimum path in the grid. 

The `dfs` function is used to traverse the grid in all four directions (up, down, left, right) from a given cell (x, y) and keep track of the path. If the length of the path equals to k, return the path. If not, recursively call dfs on all neighboring cells.

The `minPath` function iterates over all cells in the grid and calls dfs for each cell. The minimum path found so far is updated if a shorter path is found.

The time complexity of this solution is O(N^2 * k *
