This problem can be solved using dynamic programming with some modifications. We can create a 4D array dp[i][j][k][l] to store the minimum path value for each cell on the grid. The dimensions of this array are:

i and j: coordinates of the current cell.
k: the length of the current path.
l: the number of cells on the path.

We initialize dp[i][j][0][0] with the value of the current cell and iterate over k and l from 1 to k. For each k and l, we iterate over all valid neighbors of the current cell and update dp[iâ€™][jâ€™][k][l] if it's smaller than the current value.

Finally, we return the minimum value of dp[i][j][k][l] for all cells (i, j) on the grid and all k and l.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^4) and the space complexity is O(n^4).

Here is a Python code snippet that implements the above solution:

```python
import sys

def minPath(grid, k):
    n = len(grid)
    dp = [[[[sys.maxsize for _ in range(k+1)] for _ in range(n*n+1)] for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
    dx = [-1, 0, 1, 0]
    dy = [0, 1, 0, -1]

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            dp[i][j][0][0] = grid[i][j]

    for l in range(1, n*n+1):
        for kk in range(1, min(l+1, k+1)):
            for i in range(n):
                for j in range(n):
                    for z in range(4):
                        x, y = i+dx[z], j+dy[z]
                        if x>=0 and x<n and y>=0 and y<n:
                            dp[i][j][l][kk] = min(dp[i][j][l][kk], dp
