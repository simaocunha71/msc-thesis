This problem can be solved by using Dijkstra's algorithm with a heap data structure to find the minimum path in a grid. 

1. First, initialize the grid size N, the priority queue (heap), and the visited set.
2. Then, initialize the starting point (x, y) and the direction list (up, down, left, right).
3. Push the starting point and its value into the heap.
4. While the heap is not empty and we haven't visited k cells, pop the cell with the smallest value from the heap.
5. If the popped cell is not in the visited set, add it to the visited set and append its value to the result list.
6. Then, for each direction, calculate the new cell and its value, and if it's valid and not in the visited set, push it into the heap.
7. Return the result list.

Here is the Python code:

```python
import heapq

def minPath(grid, k):
    N = len(grid)
    pq, visited, res = [(grid[0][0], 0, 0)], set((0, 0)), []
    dirs = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
    while pq and len(res) < k:
        val, x, y = heapq.heappop(pq)
        if (x, y) not in visited:
            visited.add((x, y))
            res.append(val)
            for dx, dy in dirs:
                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                if 0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N and (nx, ny) not in visited:
                    heapq.heappush(pq, (grid[nx][ny], nx, ny))
    return res
```

This code uses a heap to always pop the smallest cell first, and a set to record visited cells. It also uses a direction list to iterate over all possible directions.

For example, given the input grid = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]] and
