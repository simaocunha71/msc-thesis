This problem is a classical path finding problem with a twist. It can be solved using a Dijkstra's algorithm with a priority queue and a bit of modification.

The idea is to start from each cell and find the shortest path to all other cells. Then, we can keep track of the smallest path so far and update it whenever we find a shorter path.

At each step, we need to keep track of the k smallest paths. We can use a priority queue to achieve this. The priority queue will be sorted based on the sum of the values on the path and the position of the current cell. The priority queue will also be sorted based on the path length.

The time complexity of this solution is O(k * N^2 * log(N^2)) and the space complexity is O(N^2 * k).

Here is the Python solution:

```python
import heapq

def minPath(grid, k):
    n = len(grid)
    directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
    heap = [(grid[0][0], 0, 0, [grid[0][0]])]
    visited = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]
    visited[0][0] = 1
    while heap:
        sum_path, x, y, path = heapq.heappop(heap)
        if len(path) == k:
            return path
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and not visited[nx][ny]:
                visited[nx][ny] = 1
                new_sum_path = sum_path + grid[nx][ny]
                new_path = path + [grid[nx][ny]]
                heapq.heappush(heap, (new_sum_path, nx, ny, sorted(new_path)))
    return []
```

Please note that the path is sorted at each step to ensure that the path is lexicographically smallest.

This solution assumes that the grid is a 2D list of integers and k
