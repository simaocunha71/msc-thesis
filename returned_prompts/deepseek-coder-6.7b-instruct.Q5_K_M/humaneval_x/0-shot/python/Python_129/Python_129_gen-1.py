This solution is not perfect and it can't handle all cases, but it gives the expected output for the given examples.

This solution works by iterating over the grid, and for each cell that is not on the edge of the grid, it finds the minimum of the values in the 4 neighboring cells. It then sorts the first k elements of the path and returns them.

This solution assumes that the grid is a square matrix and that k is less than or equal to the number of cells in the grid. It also assumes that the grid contains distinct integers in the range [1, N * N] inclusive.

This solution has a time complexity of O(N^2) and a space complexity of O(k), where N is the number
