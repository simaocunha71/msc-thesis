"""
This solution works by converting the input number N into a binary string using Python's built-in bin() function. The bin() function returns a string that starts with '0b' to indicate that it is a binary string. 

To get the binary representation of the digits of N, we slice this string from the 2nd index to the end. 

The result is the binary representation of the digits of N, which we then return.
"""

# This solution assumes that N is a positive integer and does not handle non-integer inputs.
# If you want to handle non-integer inputs, you should add error checking to the beginning of the function.
