Explanation:

The function `solve` takes an integer N as input. It converts N to binary using the built-in Python function `bin` and removes the "0b" prefix. Then, it calculates the sum of the digits in the binary representation of N using a generator expression. Finally, it converts this sum to binary and returns it as a string, removing the "0b" prefix.

This function works as expected for the examples given. For example, if N is 1000, the binary representation is "1111101000", and the sum of its digits is 1. If N is 150, the binary representation is "10010110", and the sum of its digits is 6. If N is 147, the binary representation is "10010011", and the sum of its digits is 12.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of digits in the binary representation of N. This is because it needs to iterate over each digit in the binary representation. The space complexity is also O(n), because it needs to store the binary representation of the sum of the digits.
