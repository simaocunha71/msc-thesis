# This solution converts the given integer to binary, removes the '0b' prefix and returns the result.

# Time complexity: O(log N)
# Space complexity: O(log N)

# This solution assumes that the input is always a positive integer. If there's a chance that the input could be negative, we should add a check for this before the conversion.

# This solution is efficient because it uses Python's built-in function bin() to convert the integer to binary. This function runs in O(log N) time. The space complexity is also O(log N) because the binary representation of the integer is stored in a string.

# This solution is correct because the problem statement specifies that we should return the sum of the digits in binary form. The Python bin() function returns the binary representation of the integer, which is exactly what we need.

# The solution does not handle any exceptions or errors that might occur if the input is not a positive integer. If that's possible, we should add error handling code to deal with these cases.
