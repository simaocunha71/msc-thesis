    '''
    This function calculates the sum of the squares of the odd integers in the list.
    It iterates through the list and checks if each number is a positive integer and odd.
    If it is, it squares the number, multiplies it by 2, and adds it to the sum.
    If the list is empty or there are no such numbers, it returns 0.
