# The function `double_the_difference` works by iterating over each item in the list,
# checking if it's an integer, if it's positive and if it's odd. If these conditions are met,
# it squares the item (using the expression `i * i`) and adds it to the sum.
# If the list is empty, the function returns 0 as expected.
