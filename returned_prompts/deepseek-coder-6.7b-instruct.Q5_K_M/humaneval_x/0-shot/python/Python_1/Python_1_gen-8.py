This solution uses a stack to keep track of the nesting depth. When the stack is empty, it means we have found a balanced group.

Both solutions return the same output. The first one uses a counter and a single pass through the string, while the second one uses a stack and two passes through the string. The second solution is more efficient because it doesn't need to slice the string for each balanced group.

The time complexity of both solutions is O(n), where n is the length of the string. The space complexity is also O(n), because in the worst case (when all parentheses are balanced) the stack or count array can contain n/2 elements.
