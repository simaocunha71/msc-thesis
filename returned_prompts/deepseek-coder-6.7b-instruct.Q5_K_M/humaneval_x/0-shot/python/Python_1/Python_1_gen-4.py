Here is a python solution using a stack to keep track of the groups.

```python
def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    stack = []
    result = []
    temp = ''
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            if temp:
                stack.append(temp)
                temp = ''
            stack.append(char)
        elif char == ')':
            stack.append(char)
            if len(stack) % 2 == 0:
                while stack[-1] != '(':
                    temp = stack.pop() + temp
                temp = stack.pop() + temp
                result.append(temp)
                temp = ''
        else:
            temp += char
    return result
```

In this function, we use a stack to keep track of the parentheses. We go through each character in the string. If it's an open parenthesis, we push it onto the stack. If it's a close parenthesis, we pop all elements from the stack until we see the corresponding open parenthesis, and we add this group to the result. We also remove the open and close parentheses from the stack. We ignore any spaces in the string.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. The space complexity is also O(n), because in the worst case scenario, we might end up storing all the characters in the string in the stack.

This function assumes that the input string is well-formed, meaning that it contains balanced parentheses. If the string might not be well-formed, you should add error checking to handle those cases.

Please note that this function does not handle nested parentheses. If you need to handle nested parentheses, you will need a different approach.
