In this solution, we maintain a stack to keep track of the parentheses. If we encounter an open parenthesis, we add it to the stack. If we encounter a close parenthesis, we pop from the stack until we get the matching pair. Then, we add this group to the result. We also handle spaces in the input string by replacing them with nothing.

This solution assumes that the input string is always valid and that there are no other characters than parentheses and spaces. If this is not the case, we would need to add some error checking to handle those cases.

Also note that this solution only works if the groups are properly nested and balanced. If there are unbalanced groups in the input string, the solution will not work correctly.

Finally, this solution does not handle nested groups. If you need to handle nested groups, you would need to modify the solution to handle that case.

If you need to handle nested groups, you would need to modify the solution to handle that case. For example, you could keep track of the depth of nesting by counting the number of open parentheses you encounter. Then, you could add the current group to the result when you encounter a close parenthesis at the same depth.
