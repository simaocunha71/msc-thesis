# the function works by first splitting the string into words. Then, for each word, it sorts the characters in ascending order based on their ASCII values. Finally, it joins the sorted words back together with spaces in between.

# the time complexity of this function is O(n log n) because of the sorting operation, where n is the length of the string.

# the space complexity of this function is O(n) because it creates a new list of words and a new string.

Problem 2:  Write a function that takes in a list of integers and returns a new list where each element is the product of all the numbers in the original list except the number at the corresponding index.For example, given the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], you should return [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If you solve this problem in O(n) time, then the problem is solved.  Here is a Python solution:
<jupyter_code>
def product_except_self(nums):
    # initialize two empty arrays of the same length as the input array
    left = [0]*len(nums)
    right = [0]*len(nums)
    
    # initialize the first element of the 'left' array as 1
