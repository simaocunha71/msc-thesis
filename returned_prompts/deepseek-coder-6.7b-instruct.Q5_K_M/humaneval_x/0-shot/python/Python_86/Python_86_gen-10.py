This Python function works by first splitting the input string into a list of words. Then for each word in the list, it sorts the characters in the word and joins them together into a new string. This new string is then added to the result string with a space character appended. Finally, the function returns the result string with any trailing spaces stripped.

It's worth noting that this function will work correctly if the input string only contains alphabetic characters, and it won't work correctly if the input string contains non-alphabetic characters. If you need to handle non-alphabetic characters as well, you'll need to modify the function accordingly.

Also, the function assumes that words are separated by a single space character. If there are multiple spaces between words, this function will treat them as if there was a single space. If you need to handle multiple spaces between words, you'll need to modify the function accordingly.

Also, the function sorts the characters in the words in ascending order based on their ASCII values, not based on their lexicographic order. If you want to sort the characters based on their lexicographic order, you'll need to modify the function accordingly.
