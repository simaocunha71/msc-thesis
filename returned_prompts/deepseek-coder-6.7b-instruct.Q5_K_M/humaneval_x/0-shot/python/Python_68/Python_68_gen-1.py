Explanation:The function `pluck` traverses the array `arr` to find the smallest even number (`min_even`). The smallest even number is initialized as `[float('inf'), -1]`. If an even number is found and it is smaller than the current `min_even`, `min_even` is updated with the new number and its index. Finally, if `min_even`'s index is not -1 (which means an even number is found), `min_even` is returned. Otherwise, an empty list is returned.  Testing the function:
<jupyter_code>
print(pluck([4,2,3]))  # Output: [2, 1]
print(pluck([1,2,3]))  # Output: [2, 1]
print(pluck([]))  # Output: []
print(pluck([5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]))  # Output: [0, 1]
<jupyter_output>
[2, 1]
[2, 1]
[]
[0, 1]
<jupyter_text>
All outputs are as expected.  Time Complexity:The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the array `arr`. This is because we traverse the array once to find the smallest even number.  Space Complexity:The space complexity of this function is O(1), which means the space used by the function does not grow with the size of the input. We only use a constant amount of space to store the smallest even number and its index.
