In this solution, we first use a list comprehension to create a list of tuples, each containing the index and value of each even number in the input array. Then, we use the min function to find the tuple with the smallest value and smallest index. If no even number is found, the default value [] is returned.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array.
