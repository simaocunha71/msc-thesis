This is a simple solution that uses a for loop to iterate over the characters in the string. It counts the vowels by checking if the lowercase version of the current character is in the string 'aeiou'. If it is, it increments the count. Finally, it checks if the last character of the string is 'y' and if so, it increments the count. It then returns the count.
