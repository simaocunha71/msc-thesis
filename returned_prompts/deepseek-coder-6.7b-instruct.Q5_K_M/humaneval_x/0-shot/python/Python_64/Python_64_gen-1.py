"""
The function vowels_count works by initializing a counter to 0 and iterating through the string. 
If the character is a vowel (either lowercase or uppercase), the counter is incremented.
If the character is 'y' and it is at the end of the string, the counter is incremented.
Finally, the counter is returned as the number of vowels in the string.

"""
Test cases:
1. "abcde" -> 2
2. "ACEDY" -> 3
3. "" -> 0
4. "Y" -> 1
5. "aeiouy" -> 3
6. "YaEoui" -> 3
7. "CaCaCAcA" -> 4
"""

"""
The function is expected to pass all the test cases.
"""

"""
Note:
The function does not handle strings with special characters or numbers.
If you want to handle such cases, you need to adjust the function accordingly.
