def vowels_count(s):
    count = 0
    vowels = "aeiou"

    for letter in s:
        if letter.lower() in vowels:
            count += 1

    if s[-1] == "y":
        count += 1

    return count

print(vowels_count("abcde"))
print(vowels_count("ACEDY"))

# Output:
# 2
# 3

# Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string.
# Space Complexity: O(1), as we are using a fixed amount of space to store the vowels and count.
