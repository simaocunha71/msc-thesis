# The code above checks whether the character is a vowel and increments the count. 
# If the character is 'y' and it is the last character of the string, it also increments the count.
# It then returns the count.

# The time complexity of the code is O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because it iterates through each character in the string once.
# The space complexity is O(1), because it uses a fixed amount of space to store the vowels and the count.
# It doesn't depend on the size of the input string.
