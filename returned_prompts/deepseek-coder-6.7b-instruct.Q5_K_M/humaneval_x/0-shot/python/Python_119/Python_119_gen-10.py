Explanation:

    This solution is based on the fact that the number of open parentheses in the
    concatenated string must be equal to the number of open parentheses in the
    original strings. If the number of open parentheses is not equal, it is not possible
    to make a good string. If the number of open parentheses is equal, then the
    number of close parentheses must be equal as well. If the number of close
    parentheses in one string is more than the number of open parentheses, it is
    not possible to make a good string. Otherwise, it is possible to make a good
    string.

    In the examples:
    - The first example: '()(', ')' is possible to concatenate to make a good string.
    - The second example: ')', ')' is not possible to concatenate to make a good string.

    This solution works by counting the number of open parentheses in each string and
    checking if the total count of open parentheses is equal in both strings. If it is,
    and the total count of close parentheses is equal as well, it means that the strings
    can be concatenated to form a good string. If the total count of close parentheses
    is more than the count of open parentheses in one string, it means that the strings
    cannot be concaten
