This program first initializes two counters, even_count and odd_count, to zero. It then converts the absolute value of the input number to a string and iterates over each character (digit) in the string. If the digit is even (i.e., its remainder when divided by 2 is zero), it increments even_count; otherwise, it increments odd_count. Finally, it returns a tuple with the counts of even and odd digits.

The time complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the number of digits in the input number. This is because it needs to iterate over each digit in the number. The space complexity is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the counters and the input number.

This program also works correctly for negative numbers, treating the absolute value of the number as the input.

The function even_odd_count can be tested with various inputs to ensure it works as expected.

Please note that this function assumes that the input is an integer. If a non-integer is passed in, it will not work as expected.

Also, this program does not handle floating point numbers. If a floating point number is passed in, it will not work as expected.
