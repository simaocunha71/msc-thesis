        # Flatten the grid and count the number of 1s
        wells = sum(grid, [])
        wells_count = wells.count(1)
        # Calculate the total capacity of the buckets
        total_capacity = capacity * len(wells)
        # Return the ratio of the total capacity to the number of wells
        # This will be the number of times you need to lower the buckets
        return math.ceil(total_capacity / wells_count)

The solution works by first flattening the grid to a 1D list of wells. Then, it counts the number of 1s in this list to get the total number of wells. It then calculates the total capacity of the buckets by multiplying the capacity of each bucket by the total number of wells. Finally, it returns the ceiling of the total capacity divided by the number of wells. This is the number of times you need to lower the buckets.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the total number of cells in the grid. This is because it iterates over the grid once to count the number of wells and once to calculate the total capacity. The space complexity is O(m), where m is the total number of cells in the grid, due to the space required to store the flattened grid.

This solution assumes that the grid is a list of lists where each inner list represents a row in the grid. The capacity is the capacity of each bucket.
