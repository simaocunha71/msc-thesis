This problem can be solved by sorting the wells in decreasing order and iterating through them. The bucket count is initialized to the total number of wells, and the index of wells is initialized to 0. The while loop continues until the bucket count reaches 0, and for each well, if the bucket can hold more water than the remaining wells, the bucket is filled with water from the well and the index is incremented. If the bucket cannot hold more
