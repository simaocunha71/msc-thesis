    This program works by iterating over each row in the grid. It then calculates the total water in that row by summing the numbers in the row. 
    It then divides this total by the bucket capacity and rounds up to the nearest whole number, because you can't have a fraction of a bucket. 
    This gives the number of buckets needed for that row. 
    It adds this number to a running total, which keeps track of the total number of buckets needed for all rows. 
    Finally, it returns this total.

"""
Here, m is the number of rows in the grid and n is the number of columns in the grid. 
The time complexity is O(m*n) because we are iterating over each cell in the grid once. 
The space complexity is O(1) because we are not using any additional space that scales with the input size.
