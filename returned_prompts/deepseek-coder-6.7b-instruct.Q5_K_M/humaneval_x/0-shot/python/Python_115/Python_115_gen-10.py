    # Firstly, we need to find the total number of wells in the grid.
    # Then, we sort the wells in descending order.
    # After that, we calculate how many times we need to lower the buckets by subtracting the next well 
    # from the current one and dividing the result by the bucket capacity.
    # Finally, we sum up all the times we need to lower the buckets and return the result.

    total_wells = sum(row.count(1) for row in grid)
    wells = sorted([row.count(1) for row in grid], reverse=True)
    return sum(math.ceil((wells[i] - wells[i + 1]) / capacity) for i in range(len(wells) - 1))


# Tests:
print(max_fill([[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]], 1)) # 6
print(max_fill([[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]], 2)) # 5
print(max_fill([[0,0,0], [0,0,0]], 5)) # 0

# Complexity: O(n*m) time, where n and m are the dimensions of the grid.
# This is because we go through each element of the grid once.
# O(n) space, where n is the total number of wells in the grid, 
# to store the number of wells in each row.

# Note: This solution assumes that the bucket can be filled with water from a well if the 
# well's water level is equal to or greater than the bucket's water level. 
# If the bucket can only be filled with water if the well's water level is greater than the bucket's water level, 
# then this solution would not work and we would need to find the minimum water level that can be achieved 
# by filling the bucket from each well.
