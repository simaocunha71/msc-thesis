The solution is to sort the grid in descending order and then count the number of 1s in each row. The number of times the bucket needs to be emptied is then the ceiling of the count divided by the bucket capacity. The math.ceil function is used to round up to the nearest integer, because you can't partially empty the bucket.

The time complexity of this solution is O(m*n*log(m*n)) where m and n are the dimensions of the grid, because we need to sort the grid. The space complexity is O(m*n) because we need to store the grid in memory.
