```python
def special_factorial(n):
    if n < 2:
        return 1
    else:
        fact = 1
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            fact *= i
        return fact * special_factorial(n-1)
```

This Python program uses a recursive function to calculate the special factorial of an input integer. It starts with the input number and multiplies it by the factorial of the number minus 1, all the way down to 1.

For example, if `special_factorial(4)` is called, the function calculates `4 * special_factorial(3)`, which equals `4 * 6 * special_factorial(2)`, which equals `4 * 6 * 2 * special_factorial(1)`, which equals `4 * 6 * 2 * 1`, which equals `288`.

This process continues until it has multiplied the input number by 1, at which point it returns 1 and the recursive calls end.

The time complexity of this function is O(n) due to the factorial calculation. The space complexity is also O(n) due to the stack space required for the recursive calls.

This function could be optimized by using memoization to store the factorial results and avoid recalculating them. However, in Python, recursion with large input may cause a recursion error.

Alternatively, a non-recursive solution can be implemented using a loop and a running product variable, which would have a space complexity of O(1). However, the time complexity would still be O(n).

In Python, the maximum recursion depth is 1000. If you try to calculate the special factorial of a number larger than 1000, you will reach the maximum recursion depth error.

The problem is a typical example of a problem that can be solved with recursion, but with a high recursion depth.

The problem can be solved with a loop and a running product variable, or with memoization, but the recursive solution is the most elegant and straightforward.

It's also worth noting that this problem can also be solved with dynamic programming, which is a more advanced technique.
