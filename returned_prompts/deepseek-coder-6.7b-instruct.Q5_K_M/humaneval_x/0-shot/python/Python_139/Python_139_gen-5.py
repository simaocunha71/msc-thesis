print(special_factorial(4))  # It should return 288


# Another way to solve it:

def special_factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        fact = 1
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            fact *= i
        return fact * special_factorial(n - 1)

print(special_factorial(4))  # It should return 288

# In this code, the function special_factorial uses a loop to calculate the factorial of a number. Afterwards, it calls itself with the argument decreased by 1, until it reaches 0 or 1, which are the base cases for the recursion.

# When calling the function with 4, it returns 288, which is the correct answer.

# This code is a solution for the problem described in the docstring.


# The time complexity of this solution is O(n), because the function calls itself n times, where n is the input number.

# The space complexity is also O(n) due to the recursive call stack. The maximum depth of this call stack is n, which is the number of recursive calls. This is the case because each recursive call reduces the problem size by 1.

# The code is correct and will work as expected for all positive integer inputs.

# It does not handle negative inputs, as per the problem statement.

# It does not handle non-integer inputs, as per the problem statement.

# It does not handle the case where n is 0 or 1, as per the problem statement.

# It handles the base case where n is 0 or 1 by returning 1.

# It handles the recursive case where n is greater than 1 by calculating the factorial of n and then calling itself with the argument n-1.

# It returns the special factorial of the input number.
