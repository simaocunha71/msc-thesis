        if n == 0 or n == 1:
            return 1
        else:
            return n * factorial(n-1)

            return 1
        else:
            return factorial(n) * special_factorial(n-1)

    print(special_factorial(4))

Output:

    288

Explanation:

The special_factorial function calculates the special factorial of a number by recursively calling the factorial function and multiplying the result of each call with the special factorial of the number one less than the current number. This process is repeated until it reaches the base case of 1. The factorial function calculates the regular factorial of a number by recursively multiplying the number by the factorial of the number one less than the current number. This process is repeated until it reaches the base case of 1.

The special_factorial function is then used to calculate and print the special factorial of 4. The result is 288.
