In this code, we first define a helper function "factorial" to calculate the factorial of a number. Then, in the "special_factorial" function, we calculate the special factorial by multiplying the factorial of each number from n to 1. We use a for loop to achieve this, and the range function is set to start from n and end at 1 (inclusive), decrementing by 1 at each step.

This function uses recursion to calculate the factorial of each number, and then multiplies these factorials together in the order specified by the problem statement. The result is returned at the end.

The time complexity of this function is O(n) because we use a loop that runs n times. The space complexity is also O(n) because we use a recursive stack to calculate the factorial of each number.

The function will return the correct result for the example given in the problem statement, and it can be modified to handle other inputs as well.
