    print(special_factorial(4))

In this code, we first define a helper function to calculate the factorial of a number. This function uses recursion to calculate the factorial of a number. Then, we define the main function special_factorial that uses a loop to calculate the special factorial of a number. It multiplies the factorial of each number from the input number down to 1. The result is returned as the output.

The code will print the result of special_factorial(4) which is 288.

This solution uses the concept of recursion and loops in Python. Recursion is used to calculate the factorial of a number and loops are used to calculate the special factorial of a number.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) because it uses a loop that runs n times. The space complexity is O(1) because it uses a constant amount of space to store the variables.

Note: This solution assumes that the input number is a positive integer. If the input number is not a positive integer, the function will return an error.

Also, the function factorial is not optimized for large values of n. It can be optimized by using a list to store the previously calculated factorials.

This code should work in any Python environment that supports recursion and loops.
