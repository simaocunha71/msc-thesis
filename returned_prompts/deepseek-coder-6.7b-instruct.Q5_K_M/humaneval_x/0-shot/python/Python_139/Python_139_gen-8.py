This code will calculate the special factorial of a given number. If the given number is 0, the result will be 1 (since 0 factorial is defined as 1). For other numbers, the code calculates the factorial by multiplying the number with all the numbers less than it. The result is returned.

I hope this helps,

Good luck with your studies.
