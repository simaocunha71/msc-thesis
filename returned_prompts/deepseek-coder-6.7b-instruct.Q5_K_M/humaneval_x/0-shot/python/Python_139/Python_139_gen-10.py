The function special_factorial(n) is defined to calculate the Brazilian factorial of an integer n. It uses a for loop to calculate the factorial of each number from 1 to n, then recursively calls itself with n-1 until n is 0, in which case it returns 1. The result is the product of n factorial and the special factorial of n-1.

This function will return the correct result for the given example, but it can be inefficient for large inputs because of the recursive calls. It has a time complexity of O(n).

The function will not run correctly for negative inputs because the factorial of a negative number is undefined.

Test the function with other values to verify its correctness.
