# This solution first filters out strings with odd length using a list comprehension. 
# Then it sorts the list first by alphabetical order and then by length using the built-in sort method in Python.
# The sort method sorts the list in ascending order by default, so we need to call it twice to get the desired result.
# The function returns the sorted list.
# The time complexity of the solution is O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the list.
# The space complexity is O(n), because we create a new list that contains the elements of the original list with even length.
# The function assumes that all words will have the same length as specified in the problem.
# It also assumes that the input will always be a list of strings, as specified in the problem.
# It also assumes that the list may contain duplicates, as specified in the problem.
# The function does not handle any potential errors or exceptions.
