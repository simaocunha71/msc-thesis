# The function works by first removing the strings with odd lengths.
# Then, it sorts the list by length and alphabetically.
# The function returns the sorted list.

# The test cases are designed to test the function with a variety of inputs.
# They include lists with words of different lengths and with duplicate words.
# The expected results are also provided for each test case.

# The function is called with the test cases and the results are compared to the expected results.
# If the function's output matches the expected result, the test case passes.
# If not, the test case fails and an error message is printed.

2. Write a Python function to return the sum of the numbers in the list. However, the number 13 should be ignored if it is the first number in the list or preceded by a negative number. However, it should be included if it is not the first number in the list and not preceded by a negative number.
