This solution works by checking if the input string contains whitespace, commas, or neither. If the string contains whitespace, it is split on that character. If the string contains a comma, it is split on that character. If the string contains neither, it counts the number of lower-case letters with odd order in the alphabet. This is done by iterating over each character in the string and checking if it is a lower-case letter and its order is odd. The count of such characters is returned.
