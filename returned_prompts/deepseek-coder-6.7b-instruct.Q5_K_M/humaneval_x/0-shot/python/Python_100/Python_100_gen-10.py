# Output: [3, 5, 7]

# This code works by creating an empty list called levels. It then enters a loop that will run n times.
# In each iteration of the loop, it adds the current number of stones to the list, and then increments the number of stones by 2.
# If the current number of stones is even, it adds 2 to it. If it's odd, it adds 3, since the problem statement specifies that the next odd number should be added.
# Finally, it returns the list of stones at each level.

# It's important to note that this code could be made more efficient by eliminating the need to check if the current number of stones is even or odd in every iteration of the loop.
# Instead, we can just increment the number of stones by 2 in each iteration, regardless of whether it's odd or even. Then, we can simply check if the current level is odd or even to decide whether the next odd or even number should be added.
# This would make the code more efficient by eliminating the need for the if-else statement.

# However, the original code is more straightforward and easier to understand for beginners, so it's the version I've chosen.

# I hope this explanation helps you understand the code. Let me know if you have any other questions.

# Note: This code assumes that the input to the function is always a positive integer. If this is not the case, you may want to add some error checking to ensure that the input is valid.
