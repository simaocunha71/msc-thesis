    return [f"the number of odd elements {count_odd_numbers(s)}n the str{count_odd_numbers(s)}ng {count_odd_numbers(s)} of the {count_odd_numbers(s)}nput." for s in lst]


print(odd_count(['1234567']))
print(odd_count(['3',"11111111"]))

Output:
["the number of odd elements 4n the str4ng 4 of the 4nput."]
["the number of odd elements 1n the str1ng 1 of the 1nput.", "the number of odd elements 8n the str8ng 8 of the 8nput."]

Explanation:

This function first defines a helper function count_odd_numbers that takes a string and counts the number of odd digits in it. Then it uses a list comprehension to create the desired output list.
