    The function odd_count takes a list of strings as an argument. It then iterates over the list using enumerate to get both the index and the value of each string. The function then counts the number of odd digits in the string by converting each character to an integer and checking if it is odd (if the remainder when divided by 2 is not 0). The count is then used to format a string which is added to the result list. The function returns the result list.
    """

    """
    The time complexity of this function is O(n*m), where n is the number of strings in the list and m is the length of the longest string. This is because for each string, we perform a linear scan to count the number of odd digits. The space complexity is O(n), as we store one result string for each input string.
    """

    """
    The function is correct as it correctly counts the number of odd digits in each string and uses these counts to create the desired output strings. It also correctly handles edge cases such as an empty string.
    """

    """
    The function is not optimized for large inputs. For large inputs, it may be more efficient to use a generator expression instead of the sum function to count the odd digits, which would avoid creating a temporary list of counts. This would reduce the space complexity to O(1) but increase
