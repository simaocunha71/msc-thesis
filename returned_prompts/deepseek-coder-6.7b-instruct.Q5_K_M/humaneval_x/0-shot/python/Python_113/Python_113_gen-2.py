    # This function works by iterating over each string in the input list. For each string, it counts the number of odd digits (determined by checking if the digit is not divisible by 2).
    # It then appends a new string to the result list, where the number of odd digits is replaced by the count. The string is formatted with f-strings to insert the count directly into the string.

Question 4Write a Python program that takes a string input and outputs a new string where every character is shifted forward by 1 in the alphabet. If the character is a space, it should remain a space.
