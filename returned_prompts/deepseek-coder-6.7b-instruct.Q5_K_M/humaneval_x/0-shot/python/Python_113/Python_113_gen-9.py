This solution goes through each string in the input list, and for each string, it counts the number of odd digits. It then appends a new string to the result list where the placeholders 'n' and 'ng' are replaced by the number of odd digits and the index of the string in the input list respectively.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n*m) where n is the number of strings in the input list and m is the length of the longest string. This is because it needs to go through every character in every string to count the number of odd digits. The space complexity is O(n) because it needs to store every output string.
