The collatz function calculates the Collatz sequence starting from the given number n, and the get_odd_collatz function filters out the odd numbers from the collatz sequence and returns them in sorted order.

Note that the collatz function uses recursion to generate the sequence, and the get_odd_collatz function uses list comprehension to filter the odd numbers from the sequence.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of terms in the Collatz sequence. This is because the collatz function is called recursively once for each term in the sequence, and the get_odd_collatz function scans through the sequence once to find the odd numbers. The space complexity is also O(n), because the collatz function may need to store all terms in the sequence if n is large.

The solution assumes that the input is a positive integer. If the input is not a positive integer, the solution may not behave as expected or may raise an exception.

In summary, this solution is a straightforward implementation of the Collatz conjecture, and it should work correctly for most inputs.
