```python
import hashlib

def string_to_md5(text):
    if text == "":
        return None
    else:
        return hashlib.md5(text.encode()).hexdigest()
```

This function takes a string as input and returns its md5 hash equivalent string. It uses the hashlib module to create an md5 hash object, which is then converted to a hexadecimal string. If the input string is empty, the function returns None.

The hashlib.md5() function is used to create a new hash object. The string.encode() method is used to convert the input string into bytes. The hexdigest() method is then used to return the hexadecimal representation of the hash.

It's important to note that md5 is not considered secure for cryptographic use, as it's vulnerable to collision attacks. For secure cryptographic use, consider using a stronger hash function like SHA-256.

Also, it's good practice to never store passwords as plaintext. Always store them as hashes.

Thanks for your question.
