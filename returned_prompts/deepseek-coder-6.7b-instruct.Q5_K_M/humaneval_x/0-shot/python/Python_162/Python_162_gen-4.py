```python
import hashlib

def string_to_md5(text):
    if text == '':
        return None
    else:
        return hashlib.md5(text.encode()).hexdigest()
```

This function first checks if the input string is empty. If it is, it returns `None`. If it's not, it computes the MD5 hash of the string and returns it in hexadecimal format.

The `hashlib.md5()` function is used to create a new MD5 hash object. The `text.encode()` is used to convert the string to bytes before it is hashed. The `.hexdigest()` function is then used to convert the hash from bytes to a hexadecimal string.


The MD5 hash is a 128-bit hash value that is commonly used in the security and cryptography world. It is a cryptographic hash function that produces a 128-bit (16-byte) hash value.


**Note:** It's not recommended to use MD5 for cryptographic purposes because it is not considered secure. Instead, you should use a hash function like SHA-256, which is considered secure for cryptographic purposes.


**Note:** The code provided here is a basic example and may not cover all edge cases. For example, it doesn't handle exceptions, so if you pass in a non-string argument, it will raise a TypeError. You should add error handling to make your function more robust.


**Note:** MD5 is not suitable for storing passwords because it's easy to compute the hash of a password. If someone gains access to your database of hashed passwords, they can use a rainbow table to quickly guess the original passwords.


**Note:** MD5 is also not suitable for cryptographic purposes because it's not secure. It's recommended to use a stronger hash function like SHA-256 or SHA-3.
