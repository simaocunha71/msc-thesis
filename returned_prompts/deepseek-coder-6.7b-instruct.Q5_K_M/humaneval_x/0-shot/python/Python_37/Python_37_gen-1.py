    even_indicies = [i for i in range(0, len(l), 2)]
    even_values = sorted([l[i] for i in even_indicies])

    result = list(l)
    for i, v in zip(even_indicies, even_values):
        result[i] = v

    return result


# Test cases
print(sort_even([1, 2, 3]))  # Expected: [1, 2, 3]
print(sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4]))  # Expected: [3, 6, 5, 4]
print(sort_even([7, 9, 1, 2, 8, 4, 6, 3]))  # Expected: [1, 9, 3, 2, 8, 4, 6, 7]


This solution works by first creating a list of the even indices in l. Then, it creates a sorted list of the values at these even indices. It then creates a copy of l, replaces the values at the even indices with the sorted values, and returns this copy.

Question 2Given an integer array nums, return the number of longest increasing subsequences. Notice that the sequence must be strictly increasing.Example 1:Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]Output: 4Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], so the output is 4.Example 2:Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]Output: 4Example 3:Input: nums = [7,7,7,7]Output: 1 Constraints:1 <= nums.length <= 2500-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4 Follow up: Could you solve this in O(n^2) time complexity and O(n) space complexity?
