```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    even_values = sorted([l[i] for i in range(0, len(l), 2)])
    result = l[:]
    for i, value in enumerate(even_values):
        result[2 * i] = value
    return result
```

Testing this function with the provided examples:

```python
print(sort_even([1, 2, 3]))  # Expected: [1, 2, 3]
print(sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4]))  # Expected: [3, 6, 5, 4]
```

The output of the testing is as expected.

This function works by first creating a sorted list of the even-indexed elements of l. It then creates a copy of l to be the result, and replaces every even-indexed element of the copy with the next element from the sorted list of even-indexed elements.

This solution is not in-place, i.e., it uses additional O(n) space to store the sorted list of even-indexed elements. If you want an in-place solution, you would need to modify the function to replace the elements in l directly, which would be more complex.

The time complexity of this function is O(n log n), which comes from the sorting operation. The space complexity is O(n), which comes from the space required to store the sorted list of even-indexed elements and the copy of l.
