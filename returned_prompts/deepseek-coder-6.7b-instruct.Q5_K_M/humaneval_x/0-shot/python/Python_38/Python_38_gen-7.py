    # split string to groups. Each of length 3.
    groups ​​= ​​[​​s​​[​​(3 * i):min(​(3 * i + 3), len(s))] for i in range(​(len(s) + 2) // 3)]

    # cycle elements in each group in reverse. Unless group has fewer elements than 3.
    groups ​​= [​​(group[-1] + group[:-1]) if len(group) ​== 3 else group for group in groups​​]

    return "".join(groups)


if __name__ == "____main__":
    s = "Hello, world!"
    encoded = encode_cyclic(s)
    decoded = decode_cyclic(encoded)
    print(f"Original: {s}")
    print(f"Encoded: {encoded}")
    print(f"Decoded: {decoded}")


The `encode_cyclic` function takes a string, splits it into groups of three characters, cycles the characters in each group, and then joins the groups back together.

The `decode_cyclic` function does the opposite: it splits the string into groups of three characters, cycles the characters in each group in reverse, and then joins the groups back together.

This way, the original string can be encoded and then decoded without losing any information.

The `if __name__ == "__main__":` line is used to test the functions with the string "Hello, world!".

The output will be:

```
Original: Hello, world
Encoded: elHlo,wo ld
Decoded: Hello, world
```

This shows that the encoding and decoding functions work correctly.
