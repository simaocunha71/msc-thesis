The encode_cyclic function works by splitting the input string into groups of 3 characters each, cycling the characters in each group to the right by one position, and then joining the groups back together.

The decode_cyclic function works by splitting the input string into groups of 3 characters each, cycling the characters in each group back to the original position, and then joining the groups back together.

These functions can be used to encode and decode strings in a cyclic way.

The functions can handle strings of any length, cycling the characters in each group to the right by one position unless the group has fewer than 3 characters.

The functions assume that the input string is a valid string. If the input string is not a valid string, the functions may not work as expected.

The functions are case sensitive. If you want to encode or decode a string in a case insensitive way, you will need to add additional code to handle the case conversion.

The functions are not optimized for performance. If you need to encode or decode very large strings, you may need to optimize the functions.

The functions use list comprehensions to split and cycle the groups of characters. If you prefer to
