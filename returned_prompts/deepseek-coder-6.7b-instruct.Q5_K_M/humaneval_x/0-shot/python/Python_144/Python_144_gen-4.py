Explanation:

The function simplify takes in two strings x and n, which are the fractions to be simplified. It converts these strings to integers, x_num and x_den for the numerator and denominator of fraction x, and n_num and n_den for the numerator and denominator of fraction n. The function then returns True if the product of x_num and n_den is divisible by the product of x_den and n_num, and False otherwise. This is a mathematical property of fractions that says two fractions are equivalent if their numerators are equivalent and their denominators are equivalent.

This is the key to simplifying the fractions. If the numerators are equivalent and the denominators are equivalent, then the fractions are equivalent and can be simplified.

The % operator returns the remainder of the division, which in this case checks if the fractions are equivalent. If the remainder is 0, then the fractions are equivalent and can be simplified, so the function returns True. Otherwise, the fractions cannot be simplified, so the function returns False.

# Answer:

def simplify(x, n):
    x_num, x_den = map(int, x.split('/'))
    n_num, n_den = map(int, n.split('/'))
    return (x_num * n_den) % (x_den * n_num) == 0

print(simplify("1/5", "5/1")) # True
print(simplify("1/6", "2/1")) # False
print(simplify("7/10", "10/2")) # False
