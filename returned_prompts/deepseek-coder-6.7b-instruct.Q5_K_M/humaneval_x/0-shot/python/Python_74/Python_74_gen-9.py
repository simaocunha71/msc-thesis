This function works by first calculating the total number of characters in each list using the sum() function combined with a generator expression. It then checks if the total character count of lst1 is less than, greater than, or equal to the total character count of lst2. Based on the comparison, it returns either lst1, lst2, or a message indicating that both lists have the same total character count.

The time complexity of this function is O(n) because it has to iterate through each string in the lists once. The space complexity is also O(n) because of the space used by the generator expressions.

It's important to note that this function assumes that the input lists only contain strings. If the lists could contain non-string items, the function would need to be modified to handle that case.
