I have made some changes in your code. In your original code, you were iterating over a list of vowels, which is unnecessary and inefficient. Instead, you can convert the vowels into a string and then check if each character in the input text is not in that string. This will be more efficient because it only needs to iterate over the input text once and the check for membership in the string is O(1), whereas if you were checking each vowel individually it would be O(n).
Also, I've changed the doctest string to escape the newline character with a backslash. In Python, the backslash \ is an escape character, so you need to escape it with another backslash to get a newline character.

A: Your code is almost correct. It
