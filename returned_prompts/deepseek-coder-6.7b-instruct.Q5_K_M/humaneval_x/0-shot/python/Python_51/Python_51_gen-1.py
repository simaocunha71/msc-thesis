<p>If you run this code in a python environment, it will automatically test the function with the examples given in the docstring. If there are no output, then all tests were passed.</p>

<h3>What this code does:</h3>

<p>This code defines a function called remove_vowels. It takes a string as input and returns a new string where all the vowels are removed. This is done using a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the input string. If the character is not a vowel (checked using the lowercase version of the character), it is included in the new string.</p>

<p>The function uses the join method to combine all the characters in the list into a single string.</p>

<p>Finally, the code includes a main block that uses doctest to automatically check the function against the examples given in the docstring.</p>

<h3>How to use this code:</h3>

<p>You can use this code in your own Python programs by defining a function with the same signature and body. Here's how you might do that:</p>

<pre><code>def remove_vowels(text):
    """
    remove_vowels is a function that takes string and returns string without vowels.
    """
    return ''.join([letter for letter in text if letter.lower() not in 'aeiou'])</code></pre>

<p>Then you can call this function with a string as its argument:</p>

<pre><code>print(remove_vowels("Hello, world!"))  # prints "Hll, wrld!"</code></pre>

<p>This will remove all the vowels from the string "Hello, world!" and print the result.</p>
