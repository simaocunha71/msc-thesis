The function works by first finding the start and end of the intersection of the two intervals. If the start is greater than the end, there is no intersection and the function returns "NO". If there is an intersection, the length of the intersection is calculated by subtracting the start from the end and adding 1. The function then checks if this length is a prime number by iterating from 2 to the square root of the length and checking if the length is divisible by any of these numbers. If it is, the function returns "NO", otherwise it returns "YES".

This function works for any two intervals, as long as they are given as pairs of integers where the start is less than or equal to the end.

The time complexity of this function is O(sqrt(n)), where n is the length of the intersection of the two intervals, as it checks up to the square root of the length to see if it is a prime number. The space complexity is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the start, end, and length
