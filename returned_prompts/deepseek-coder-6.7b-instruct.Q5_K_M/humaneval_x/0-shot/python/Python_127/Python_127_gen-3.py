Explanation:

In the function intersection, the start of the intersection is the maximum start of the two intervals, and the end of the intersection is the minimum end of the two intervals. If the start of the intersection is greater than its end, there is no intersection. If the length of the intersection is less than 2, it cannot be a prime number, so return "NO". Then we check if the length of the intersection is a prime number by trying to divide it by all integers from 2 to its square root. If it can be divided without remainder, it is not a prime number, so return "NO". If it can't be divided by any of these integers, it is a prime number, so return "YES".

This function works for all possible inputs because it always computes the start and end of the intersection, and checks if the length of the intersection is a prime number, which is always possible.

It is important to note that the function assumes that the start of the interval is less
