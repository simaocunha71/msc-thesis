Explanation:

This function works by first sorting the lengths of the sides of the triangle. This ensures that the longest side is always the last element in the sorted list. This is because we are looking for a right angle, which is a 90 degree angle, which occurs when the square of the longest side is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. We can then simply return the result of this comparison.

This function assumes that the input will always be three positive numbers. If this is not the case, we would need to add some error checking to handle invalid inputs.

Note: This function uses the Pythagorean theorem to check if a triangle is right-angled. The theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

This function returns True if the input sides form a right-angled triangle, and False otherwise.
