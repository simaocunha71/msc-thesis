# The function works by iterating over the list and checking if any element is greater than or equal to the threshold. If it finds such an element, it immediately returns False, indicating that not all numbers are below the threshold. If it goes through the entire list without finding such an element, it returns True, indicating that all numbers are below the threshold.

# The function works by using Python's built-in all() function, which returns True if all elements in an iterable are true. The iterable here is a generator that checks each element in the list to see if it is less than the threshold. If all elements are less than the threshold, all() will return True, indicating that all numbers are below the threshold. If any element is not less than the threshold, all() will return False, indicating that not all numbers are below the threshold.

Exercise 3: Counting and Summing Elements (1 point)Write a function named `count_and_sum` that takes a list of integers as an argument and returns a tuple with two elements. The first element of the tuple should be the number of positive integers in the list and the second element should be the sum of the positive integers
