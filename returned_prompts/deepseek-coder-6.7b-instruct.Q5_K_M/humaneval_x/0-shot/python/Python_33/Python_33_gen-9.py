This function works by first creating a sorted list of elements at indices divisible by 3. Then it creates a new list, where if an index is divisible by 3, it replaces the element with the next element from the sorted list (`pop(0)` removes the first element of the list and returns it). If the index is not divisible by 3, it keeps the original element.

It's important to note that this function modifies the sorted list, which could be undesirable if we need to reuse it. In such a case, you should make a copy of the sorted list before using it.

Also, this function assumes that the list has at least one element. If the list can be empty, you should add a check for that before trying to access elements.

The time complexity of this function is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the length of the list.

The space complexity is O(n), because it creates two lists of the same size as the input list.
