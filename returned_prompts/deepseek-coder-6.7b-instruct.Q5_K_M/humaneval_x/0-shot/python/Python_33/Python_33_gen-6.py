```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    div_three = sorted([l[i] for i in range(len(l)) if i % 3 == 0])
    result = [l[i] if i % 3 != 0 else div_three.pop(0) for i in range(len(l))]
    return result
```

In this solution, I first create a list of elements at indices that are divisible by 3, sorted. Then, I use a list comprehension to create the result. If the index is not divisible by 3, I just take the element from l, otherwise I take the first element from div_three and remove it from div_three.

I chose to use list comprehension because it is a more pythonic way of solving the problem and it's also more efficient.

I'm also using the fact that pop(0) is an O(n) operation. But since the number of elements popped is smaller than n, this solution is still efficient.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, and the space complexity is O(n) for the result list.

Note that the given question states that the elements at indices divisible by three should be sorted, but it doesn't specify what should happen if there are more elements at indices divisible by three than there are elements in the list. In the provided solution, I assumed that all elements at indices divisible by three should be sorted, but if you want to sort only a subset of the elements, you'll need to modify the solution accordingly.

Also note that this solution assumes that the indices in the question start at 0, which is the usual convention in Python. If the indices start at 1, you'll need to adjust the solution accordingly.

Finally, this solution doesn't handle cases where the input list is empty, so you'll need to add error checking for that if you want to use it in a production environment.
