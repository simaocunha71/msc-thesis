    # First we identify the indices that are divisible by 3
    indices = [i for i in range(len(l)) if (i+1) % 3 == 0]

    # Then we sort the elements at these indices
    sorted_elements = sorted(l[i] for i in indices)

    # Finally, we replace the elements at these indices in the original list by the sorted elements
    for i, e in zip(indices, sorted_elements):
        l[i] = e

    return l
