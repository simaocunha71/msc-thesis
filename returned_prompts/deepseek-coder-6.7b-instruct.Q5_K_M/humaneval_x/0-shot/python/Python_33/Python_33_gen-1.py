```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    sorted_third = sorted(l[i] for i in range(len(l)) if i % 3 == 0)
    result = l.copy()
    result[i] = sorted_third[i//3] if i % 3 == 0 else l[i] for i in range(len(l))
    return result
```

This program works by first creating a sorted list of the elements at indices divisible by 3, then creating a new list where the elements at indices divisible by 3 are replaced with the corresponding elements from the sorted list. The elements at non-divisible-by-3 indices are left unchanged. 

The issue with the previous solution is that it tries to assign a value to a variable before it is defined.

Corrected code:

```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    sorted_third = sorted(l[i] for i in range(len(l)) if i % 3 == 0)
    result = [sorted_third[i//3] if i % 3 == 0 else l[i] for i in range(len(l))]
    return result
```

This solution uses a list comprehension to create the result list. The expression `sorted_third[i//3] if i % 3 == 0 else l[i]` generates the element for each index `i` in the original list `l`. If `i` is divisible by 3, it generates the corresponding element from the sorted list `sorted_third`; otherwise, it generates the element from `l`. The result is a new list where the elements at indices divisible by 3 are sorted, and the elements at non-divisible-by-3 indices are left unchanged.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n), where n is the length of the input list `l`. This is due to the sorting operation on the list of elements at indices divisible by 3. The space complexity is O(n), as a new list is created to store the result.

Here is how you can test the function:

```python
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: [1, 2,
