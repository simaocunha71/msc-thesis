This code works by first sorting every third element in the list. Then, it goes through every third element in the list and replaces it with the next smallest element from the sorted list of every third element.

If you run this code with the list [5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2], it will first sort the elements at indices 0, 3, and 6 to get [5, 3, 2]. Then it will replace the elements at indices 0, 3, and 6 with 5, 3, and 2, respectively, resulting in the list [5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2].

The function `sort_third` is also tested with the examples provided in the docstring.
