Explanation:

This function works by iterating over each element in the input list. If the element is negative, it first rounds it down to the nearest integer (which effectively converts it to the upper integer), and then squares it. If the element is non-negative, it first rounds it up to the nearest integer, and then squares it. The sums of these squared numbers are then summed and returned.

This ensures that each number in the list is rounded to the upper integer before being squared, as per the problem statement.

Note that the int() function used in this solution is used to convert the numbers to integers, and the ** operator is used to square the numbers.

Also note that the negative sign is removed before squaring negative numbers to ensure they are rounded to the upper integer, as per the problem statement.

Finally, the sum() function is used to sum up the squared numbers, and the result is returned.
