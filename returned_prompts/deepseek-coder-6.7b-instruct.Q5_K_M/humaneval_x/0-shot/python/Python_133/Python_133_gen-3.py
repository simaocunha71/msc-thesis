# In the question, it's stated that "round each element in the list to the upper int(Ceiling) first".
# However, when the input is a negative number, rounding to the upper integer should be done using
# the floor division (-) operator and not the built-in round function. The built-in round function
# rounds to the nearest even number, so it would not give the correct output in this case.
# Therefore, I used int(-x) to get the floor division result which gives the correct output.

# The solution works by iterating over each element in the list, rounding it to the upper integer
# using int(-x), and then squaring that result before summing those squares. The sum of these squares
# is then returned.

# This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the list, because it needs
# to iterate over each element in the list once.

# This solution has a space complexity of O(1), because it only uses a single variable to store the
# sum, and does not use any additional data structures that scale with the size of the input list.

# The test cases provided in the question are all correct and will pass if the function is implemented correctly.
# The function should work correctly for any list of numbers.
