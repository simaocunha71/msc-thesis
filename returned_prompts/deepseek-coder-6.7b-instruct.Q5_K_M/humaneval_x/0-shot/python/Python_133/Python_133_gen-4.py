Explanation:
This problem can be solved by using list comprehension with the built-in Python function `sum()`. 

In the list comprehension, for each number in the given list, we first round it to the upper int(Ceiling) using the built-in `int()` function. The `abs()` function is used to take care of negative numbers. Then we square the rounded number using the `**` operator.

Finally, we pass this list of squared numbers to the `sum()` function to get the sum of all the squared numbers in the list.

Note that we use `abs()` to convert negative numbers to positive numbers and `0.5` to round up to the nearest integer.

This solution works because the `int()` function rounds numbers to the nearest integer, but we add `0.5` before rounding to ensure that we round up when the number is exactly halfway between two integers.

This way, we can handle numbers with decimal parts, and we also handle negative numbers correctly.

This function works for any list of numbers, regardless of their size. It has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.
