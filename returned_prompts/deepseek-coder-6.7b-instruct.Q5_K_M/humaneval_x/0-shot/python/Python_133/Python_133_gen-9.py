    return sum(int(abs(num) + 0.5) ** 2 for num in lst)


# Test cases
print(sum_squares([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: 14
print(sum_squares([1, 4, 9]))  # Output: 98
print(sum_squares([1, 3, 5, 7]))  # Output: 84

# The solution works by using a generator expression to iterate over each number in the list. The abs() function is used to make the number positive if it is negative, and the 0.5 is added to round the number to the nearest integer. Finally, the squared result is added to the sum, which is returned at the end.

# The rounding is done by adding 0.5 before taking the floor of the number, which effectively rounds to the nearest integer.

# It's important to note that this solution assumes that the input list will only contain numbers, and that the numbers will be floating point numbers.

# The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input list, because we are iterating over each number in the list once. The space complexity is O(1), because we are using a constant amount of space to store the sum and the generator expression.

# The solution is based on the idea that the square of the absolute value of a number is the same as the square of the number, regardless of whether the number is positive or negative.


# This solution is correct and efficient, and it uses Python's built-in functions and syntax to make it concise and readable.
