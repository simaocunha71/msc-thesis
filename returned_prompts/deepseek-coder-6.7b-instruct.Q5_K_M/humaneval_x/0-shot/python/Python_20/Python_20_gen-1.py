Here is a Python solution using a simple approach:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    assert len(numbers) >= 2, "List must have at least two numbers"
    numbers.sort()  # sort the list in ascending order
    smallest_difference = float('inf')  # initialize smallest difference to infinity
    closest_elements = (0, 0)  # initialize closest elements to (0, 0)

    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        difference = numbers[i+1] - numbers[i]  # calculate the difference
        if difference < smallest_difference:  # if difference is smaller than the smallest difference
            smallest_difference = difference  # update smallest difference
            closest_elements = (numbers[i], numbers[i+1])  # update closest elements

    return closest_elements
```

This solution sorts the input list in ascending order. It then iterates over the list and calculates the difference between each pair of numbers. If the difference is smaller than the smallest difference found so far, it updates the smallest difference and the closest elements. Finally, it returns the closest elements.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the length of the input list. The space complexity is O(1) as it only uses a constant amount of space.

Please note that if there are multiple pairs of numbers with the same smallest difference, this solution will return the first pair it finds.

This solution assumes that the input list contains distinct numbers. If the list can contain duplicate numbers, you would need to modify the solution to handle that case.
