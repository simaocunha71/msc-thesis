This function works by first checking if the length of the string is less than 2. If it is, it immediately returns False because the length of the string has to be at least 2 to be prime. Then it checks if the length of the string is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of the length (inclusive). If it is divisible, it returns False because the length is not prime. If it doesn't find a divisor, it returns True because the length is prime.

The square root of the length is used as the upper limit because a larger factor of the number would be a multiple of smaller factor that has already been checked.

The time complexity of this function is O(sqrt(n)) because it iterates from 2 to the square root of the length of the string. The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the length of the string and the loop counter.
