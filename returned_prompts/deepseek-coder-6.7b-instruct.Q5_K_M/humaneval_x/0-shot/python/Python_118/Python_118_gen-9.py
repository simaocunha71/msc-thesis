# The function goes through the word from the right (excluding the first and last characters) 
# and checks if the current character is a vowel (is in the 'vowels' string) and 
# if the previous and the next characters are not vowels. If such a character is found, 
# it is returned. If no such character is found after checking all characters, 
# an empty string is returned.
