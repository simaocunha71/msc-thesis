    for i in range(len(word) - 2, 0, -1):
        if word[i] in vowels and word[i-1] not in vowels and word[i+1] not in vowels:

print(get_closest_vowel("yogurt")) # ==> "u"
print(get_closest_vowel("FULL")) # ==> "U"
print(get_closest_vowel("quick")) # ==> ""
print(get_closest_vowel("ab")) # ==> ""

# Note: This solution iterates over the string from right to left (except the first and last characters),
# checking at each position if the character is a vowel and the two characters to its left and right are not vowels.
# If it finds such a character, it returns it. If it doesn't find any, it returns an empty string.
