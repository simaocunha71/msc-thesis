# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(1)

# Explanation:
# The function traverses the string from the end (right side) and checks each character if it is a vowel and the 
# characters on its left and right are not vowels. If it finds such a vowel, it returns it. If it doesn't find any, it 
# returns an empty string.
