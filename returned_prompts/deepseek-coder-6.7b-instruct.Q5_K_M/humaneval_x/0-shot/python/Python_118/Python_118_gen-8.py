    word = word[::-1]
    for i in range(1, len(word) - 1):
        if word[i] in vowels and word[i-1] not in vowels and word[i+1] not in vowels:
            return word[i]

print(get_closest_vowel("yogurt"))  # ==> "u"
print(get_closest_vowel("FULL"))  # ==> "U"
print(get_closest_vowel("quick"))  # ==> ""
print(get_closest_vowel("ab"))  # ==> ""

# Solution
# The function 'get_closest_vowel' is reversing the given word and scanning from right to left. 
# It is checking whether each character is a vowel and whether its previous and next characters are not vowels. 
# If it finds such a character, it returns it. If it doesn't find any, it returns an empty string.
