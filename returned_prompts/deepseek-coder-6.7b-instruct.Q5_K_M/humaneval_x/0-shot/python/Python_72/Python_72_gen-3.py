print(will_it_fly([1, 2], 5)) # False

In this solution, we first check if the list q is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse (q[::-1]). If it's a palindrome, we then check if the sum of its elements is less than or equal to w. If both conditions are met, the function will return True, otherwise it will return False.

This solution is simple, clear, and efficient. It uses Python's list slicing to reverse the list, and the sum function to calculate the sum of the elements in the list.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) because it has to iterate over the list q to check if it's a palindrome and to calculate its sum. The space complexity is also O(n) because it uses a new list to store the reversed list.

This solution should work for all inputs provided in the problem statement. However, it assumes that the input list q contains only integers and that the maximum possible weight w is also an integer. If these assumptions are not true, the function may not work as expected.

If you want to check if the list is a palindrome regardless of its elements' types, you could modify the function to convert the elements of q to strings and then compare the list to its reverse.
    def will_it_fly(q,w):
        if str(q) == str(q)[::-1] and sum(q) <= w:
            return True
        else:
            return False
This solution would work with lists that contain non-integer elements.
