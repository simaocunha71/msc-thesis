    def will_it_fly(q, w):
        if q[::-1] == q and sum(q) <= w:
            return True
        else:
            return False

# Test cases:

print(will_it_fly([1, 2], 5)) # ➞ False
print(will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1)) # ➞ False
print(will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9)) # ➞ True
print(will_it_fly([3], 5)) # ➞ True

The function works by first checking if the list is a palindrome (q[::-1] == q). If it is, it then checks if the sum of the elements in the list is less than or equal to the maximum weight w. If both conditions are met, the function returns True, otherwise it returns False.

Note: The function assumes that the weights are non-negative integers. If this is not the case, you would need to modify the function to handle this additional case.

I hope this helps, and let me know if you have any other questions.
