This Python function works by first checking if the given list is palindromic. It does this by comparing the list to its reverse. If they're the same, it's a palindrome, and the object will not fly. If they're not the same, it's not a palindrome, and the object may fly.

Next, the function checks if the sum of the elements in the list is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight. If it is, the object will fly. If not, it will not fly.

Finally, the function returns whether or not the object will fly.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the list, because it has to iterate over the list to reverse it and calculate the sum. The space complexity is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of additional space.

Note: The function assumes that the list only contains positive integers, as per the problem statement. If the list can contain negative integers, the function would need to be modified to handle that.
