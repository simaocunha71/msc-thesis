The function `pairs_sum_to_zero` works by iterating over all possible pairs of elements in the list and checking if their sum is zero. If it finds such a pair, it immediately returns `True`. If it iterates over all pairs without finding a pair that sums to zero, it returns `False`.

This function has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the list. This is because, in the worst-case scenario, it needs to check every pair of elements in the list.

Please note that this function will not work correctly if the list contains duplicate elements. For example, it will incorrectly identify a pair of -1 and 1 as a pair that sums to zero. If you need to handle lists with duplicate elements, you would need to modify the function accordingly.
Also, it does not handle the case of an empty list. If you need to handle this case, you would need to modify the function accordingly.
