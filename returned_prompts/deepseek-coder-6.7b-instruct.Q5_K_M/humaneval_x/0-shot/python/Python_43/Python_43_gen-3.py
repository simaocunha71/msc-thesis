# The solution works by first sorting the list. It then initializes two variables, left and right, to the indices of the beginning and end of the list respectively. It then enters a while loop that continues as long as left is less than right. In each iteration of the loop, it checks if the sum of the elements at the indices pointed to by left and right is less than 0. If so, it increments left by 1, indicating that the current left element is too small. If the sum is greater than 0, it decrements right by 1, indicating that the current right element is too large. If the sum is 0, it returns True, indicating that it has found two elements that sum to 0. If the loop finishes without finding two elements that sum to 0, it returns False.
