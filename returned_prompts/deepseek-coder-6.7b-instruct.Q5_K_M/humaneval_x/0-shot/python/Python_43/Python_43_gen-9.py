# Test cases
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]))  # False
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]))  # False
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]))  # False

This solution works by first sorting the list in ascending order. It then uses two pointers, one at the beginning of the list and one at the end. If the sum of the numbers at these positions is less than zero, it moves the start pointer forward. If the sum is greater than zero, it moves the end pointer backward. If it ever finds two numbers that sum to zero, it returns True. If it scans the entire list without finding such pairs, it returns False.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, and the space complexity is O(1) since it only uses a constant amount of additional space.
