# Test cases
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]))  # False
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]))  # False
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]))  # False
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7]))  # True
print(pairs_sum_to_zero([1]))  # False

# Solution:
# The function first sorts the list in ascending order. It then initializes two pointers, left and right, at the beginning and end of the list respectively. It then enters a while loop that continues until left is less than right. In each iteration of the loop, it calculates the sum of the elements at the indices pointed to by left and right. If this sum is less than zero, it increments left by 1 (moving to the next smaller number). If the sum is greater than zero, it decrements right by 1 (moving to the next larger number). If the sum is exactly zero, it returns True, because it has found two numbers that sum to zero. If it exits the while loop without finding such two numbers, it returns False.
