In the code above, we first check if the list has at least two elements. If not, we return False immediately. 

Then, we create an empty dictionary to store the elements of the list. 

We iterate over each element in the list. For each element, we check if its opposite (-e) is in the dictionary. If it is, it means that there are two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, so we return True. 

If the opposite of the current element is not in the dictionary, we add the current element to the dictionary. 

If we finish iterating over all elements and haven't found any pair that sums to zero, we return False.

Finally, we use the doctest module to automatically check if the function works as expected.

This function works in O(n) time complexity because we iterate over the list once and perform a constant-time operation (dictionary lookup and insertion) for each element.
