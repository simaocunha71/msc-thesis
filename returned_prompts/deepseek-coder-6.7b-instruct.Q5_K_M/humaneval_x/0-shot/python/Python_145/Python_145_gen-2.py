# Here, we first define a helper function `sum_digits` which sums the digits of a number. If the number is negative, we convert it to positive first. Then we sort the original list `nums` using the key of a tuple `(sum_digits(n), nums.index(n))`. This tuple is sorted first by the sum of the digits, and if there are equal sums, it's sorted by the index in the original list.

# This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) because of the sorting operation. The space complexity is O(n) because we're creating a new list that's the same size as the input list.

# This solution works for both positive and negative numbers, and it handles the case where the input list is empty correctly.

# The helper function `sum_digits` uses Python's built-in functions `str` and `int` to convert the number to a string and then back to a list of digits, respectively. It then sums up these dig
