You can use the built-in set data type in python to find the intersection (common elements) of two lists. The & operator is used to find the intersection of two sets. Then, the sorted function is used to sort the resulting list.

Also, you can use the built-in doctest module to test your code. The doctest.testmod() function will automatically search for tests in the docstrings of your functions and run them. If all tests pass, it will print nothing. If any tests fail, it will print the test that failed.
