Here is the code solution:

```python
def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This code works by iterating through the list of operations. For each operation, it adds the value to the current balance. If the balance ever goes below zero at any point, the function immediately returns `True`. If the function finishes without finding a negative balance, it returns `False`.

This solution assumes that the `operations` list contains only integers. If this is not the case, you will need to add some error checking to handle non-integer values.

You could also use the `any` function in Python to simplify the code:

```python
def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    return any(balance := balance + operation < 0 for operation in operations)
```

This version of the function does the same thing as the previous version, but uses a generator expression to check each operation in the list. The `:=` operator is a feature in Python 3.8 and later that assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression. If the balance ever goes below zero, the `any` function will return `True` and the function will stop executing. If no negative balance is found by the end of the list, `any` will return `False`.

Both versions of the function will return `True` if the balance ever goes below zero and `False` otherwise.

Note: In Python, the `:=` operator is known as the "walrus operator" and it was introduced in Python 3.8.
