Here is a Python function that solves the problem:

```python
def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This function initializes a balance to 0 and then iteratively adds each operation to the balance. If the balance ever falls below 0, the function immediately returns True. If the function finishes iterating through all operations without the balance ever falling below 0, it returns False.

Note that this solution assumes that the operations list will only contain integers.

Also, this solution assumes that the operations list will not be empty. If that's not the case, you should add a check at the beginning of the function to handle that situation.

Here's what the code would look like with that check:

```python
def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    if not operations:
        return False
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This version of the function will return False if the operations list is empty.

Here's an example of how you might run the function:

```python
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # False
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # True
```

This will print False and True, respectively, to the console.
