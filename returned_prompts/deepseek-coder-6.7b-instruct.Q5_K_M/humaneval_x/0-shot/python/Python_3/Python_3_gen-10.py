Here is a Python solution for the problem. The function below_zero iterates over the list of operations, adding each operation to a running total. If at any point the running total falls below zero, the function returns True. If it doesn't, the function returns False after going through the entire list of operations.

```python
def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    total = 0
    for operation in operations:
        total += operation
        if total < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

In this solution, we assume that the operations are integers, where a positive integer represents a deposit and a negative integer represents a withdrawal. The function works by summing up all the operations and checking if the total ever drops below zero. If it does, the function returns True, indicating that the balance fell below zero at some point. If the total never drops below zero, the function returns False, indicating that the balance never fell below zero.
