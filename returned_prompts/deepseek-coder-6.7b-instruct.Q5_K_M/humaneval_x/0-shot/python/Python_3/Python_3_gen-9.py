Here is a Python solution that uses a simple loop to calculate the cumulative sum of the operations. If the cumulative sum ever goes below zero, the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

```python
def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This function works by iterating through the list of operations. For each operation, it adds the value to the current balance. If the balance goes below zero at any point, the function immediately returns True. If no operation makes the balance go below zero, the function returns False after all operations have been processed.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of operations. This is because the function makes a single pass over the operations list. The space complexity is O(1), which means that the function uses a constant amount of additional space that does not depend on the size of the operations list.

Here's how you can use it:

```python
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # False
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # True
```

It works as expected.

The function is implemented in Python 3.6 and later versions, so it can be used in any environment where Python 3.6 or later is installed.

The function also works with negative operations, not just positive ones. If you were to pass a list like [-1, -2, -3], it would return False because the balance never goes below zero.

If you were to pass a list like [1, -2, -3], it would return True because the balance goes below zero at the second operation.

```python
print(below_zero([-1, -2, -3]))  # False
print(below_zero([1, -2, -3]))  # True
```

It works as expected.
