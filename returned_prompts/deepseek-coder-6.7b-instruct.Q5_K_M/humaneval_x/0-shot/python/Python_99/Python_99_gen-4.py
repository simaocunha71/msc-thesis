In this code, we first convert the string to a float. Then, we check if the decimal part of the number is less than 0.5. If it is, we round down to the nearest integer. If it's not, we check if the number is positive. If it is, we round up to the nearest integer. If it's not, we round down to the nearest integer. This code handles all the edge cases and correctly rounds the number to the closest integer.

This code works by checking if the decimal part of the number is less than 0.5. If it is, it rounds down to the nearest integer. If the decimal part is not less than 0.5, it checks if the number is positive. If it is, it rounds up to the nearest integer. If the number is not positive, it rounds down to the nearest integer. This handles all the edge cases and correctly rounds the number to the closest integer.
