Explanation:

The function words_in_sentence takes a string sentence as input, splits it into words using the split() method,
and then joins the words back together in the same order, but only if their lengths are prime numbers.
The helper function is_prime checks if a number is prime. It does this by trying to divide the number by all numbers up to its square root,
and if any of these divisions have no remainder, it returns False. If none of these divisions have no remainder, the number is prime, and the function returns True.
