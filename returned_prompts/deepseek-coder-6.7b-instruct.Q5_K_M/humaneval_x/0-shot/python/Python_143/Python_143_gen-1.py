This solution works by first defining a helper function `is_prime(n)` that checks if a number is prime. Then, the function `words_in_sentence(sentence)` splits the input sentence into words and uses a list comprehension to create a new string that only contains words of prime length. The `join` method is used to concatenate the words back into a sentence.

The `is_prime` function works by iterating from 2 to the square root of the input number and checking if it is divisible by any of these numbers. If it is, the function returns `False`, otherwise it returns `True`. This is an efficient way to check if a number is prime.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n*sqrt(m)), where n is the number of words in the sentence and m is the length of the longest word. This is because for each word, the `is_prime` function is called and this operation takes O(sqrt(m)) time. The space complexity is O(n), as a new list of words is created.

Note: The term "prime" is used in this context to refer to a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The function `is_prime` is designed to work with positive integers. In this problem, we are considering words to
