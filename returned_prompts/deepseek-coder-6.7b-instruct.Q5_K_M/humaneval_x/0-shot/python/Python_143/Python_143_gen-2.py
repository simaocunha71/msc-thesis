This solution works by first defining a helper function `is_prime` to check if a number is a prime number. It then splits the input sentence into words. For each word, it checks if the length of the word is a prime number using the `is_prime` function. If it is, it adds the word to the result list. Finally, it joins the words in the result list into a single string with spaces between the words and returns the result.
