Test cases:

1. prod_signs([1, 2, 2, -4]) should return -9

In the first test case, the sum of the magnitudes is 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 9. The product of the signs is 1 * 1 * 1 * -1 = -1.
The final result is -1 * 9 = -9.

In the second test case, the sum of the magnitudes is 0 + 1 = 1. The product of the signs is 1 * 1 = 1.
The final result is 1 * 1 = 1.

In the third test case, there are no numbers to process, so the function returns None.

In the fourth test case, the sum of the magnitudes is 3 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 9. The product of the signs is 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 = 1.
The final result is 1 * 9 = 9.

The function works by iterating over the array of numbers. For each number, it checks if it is positive or negative, and updates the product of the signs accordingly. It also adds the absolute value of the number to the sum of the magnitudes. Finally, it returns the product of
