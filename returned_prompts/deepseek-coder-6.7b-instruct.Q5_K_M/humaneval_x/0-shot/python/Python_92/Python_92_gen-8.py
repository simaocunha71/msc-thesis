# The function first checks if all inputs are integers. 
# If they are, it then checks if one of them is equal to the sum of the other two. 
# If both conditions are met, it returns True, otherwise it returns False.

# The function's name and purpose are self-explanatory, hence the docstring is not needed.
# However, the problem statement includes a sample input and output which is a good practice to follow.

# The function can be optimized by eliminating the unnecessary use of the 'or' operator.
# If any one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two, we can break the loop immediately.
# The 'isinstance' function is used to ensure that all inputs are integers.
# The 'return' statement is used to exit the function early and return a value if appropriate.
