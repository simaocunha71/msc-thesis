This solution uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, that means there is no matching opening bracket, so it returns False. If there is a matching opening bracket, it pops it from the stack. After going through all the brackets, it returns True if and only if the stack is empty (which means all opening brackets have a corresponding closing bracket).

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because it goes through each bracket once. The space complexity is also O(n), because in the worst case (when all brackets are opening) the stack can store all the brackets.

Note: This solution assumes that the input string only contains "<" and ">". If there could be other characters in the string, additional error checking would be needed.

The function correct_bracketing() checks if brackets are correctly nested in the given string. It does this by using a stack data structure. Each time it encounters an opening bracket, it pushes it into the stack. Each time it encounters a closing bracket, it pops the top element from the stack. If there is no matching opening bracket for a closing bracket, it returns False. If all opening brackets have matching closing brackets, it returns True.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) because it processes each bracket once, and a space complexity of O(n) because in the worst case (when all brackets are opening) the stack can store all the brackets.
