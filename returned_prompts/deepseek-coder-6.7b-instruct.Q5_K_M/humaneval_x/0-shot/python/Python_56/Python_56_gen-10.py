# The function uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets.
# When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if there is a corresponding opening bracket in the stack.
# If there is, it pops it from the stack; if there isn't, it returns False.
# At the end of the string, if there are any opening brackets left in the stack, it returns False.
# Otherwise, it returns True.

# This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string.
# This is because it traverses the string once.
# The space complexity is also O(n), in the worst case scenario when all brackets are opening brackets.

# The function also handles edge cases such as an empty string, which would return True, and a string with only closing brackets, which would return False.
# In these cases, the function would return the expected result.
