```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    stack = []
    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket == "<":
            stack.append(bracket)
        elif bracket == ">":
            if not stack or stack[-1] != "<":
                return False
            stack.pop()
    return not stack
```
In this solution, we use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. When we encounter a closing bracket, we check if the last element in the stack is an opening bracket. If it is, we pop it from the stack. If it's not, or if the stack is empty, we return False. If the stack is empty at the end of the string, we return True.

This solution assumes that the input string only contains '<' and '>'. If the input could contain other characters, we would need to add a check for those characters.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string. The space complexity is also O(n), as in the worst case, we might push all the characters onto the stack.

It is also worth noting that this solution assumes that the input string is well-formed. If the input string can contain unmatched brackets, we would need to add a check for that.
