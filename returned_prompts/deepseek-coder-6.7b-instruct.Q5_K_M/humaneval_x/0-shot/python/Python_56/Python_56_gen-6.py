```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    stack = []

    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket == '<':
            stack.append(bracket)
        elif bracket == '>':
            if not stack or stack[-1] != '<':
                return False
            stack.pop()

    return not stack
```

Explanation:

We use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. When we encounter a closing bracket, we check if the last bracket in the stack is an opening bracket. If it is, we remove it from the stack. If not, we return False. If there are any opening brackets left in the stack after we've checked all the closing brackets, we return False, as there are unpaired opening brackets. Otherwise, we return True.
