# Test cases
print(circular_shift(12, 1))  # Output: "21"
print(circular_shift(12, 2))  # Output: "12"
print(circular_shift(12345, 3))  # Output: "34512"
print(circular_shift(12345, 6))  # Output: "54321"

# If you run this script, it will print:
# 21
# 12
# 34512
# 54321
# which are the expected outputs.

# The code first converts the integer x into a list of its digits. Then, if the shift is greater than the number of digits, it will reverse the digits. Otherwise, it will shift the digits to the right by the specified amount and return the result.

# In the first test case, 12 is shifted one place to the right, resulting in 21.
# In the second test case, 12 is not shifted because the shift is equal to the number of digits.
# In the third test case, 12345 is shifted three places to the right, resulting in 34512.
# In the fourth test case, 12345 is shifted six places to the right, resulting in 54321.
