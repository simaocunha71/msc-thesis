# Test cases
print(circular_shift(12, 1))  # "21"
print(circular_shift(12, 2))  # "12"
print(circular_shift(12345, 3))  # "45123"
print(circular_shift(12345, 6))  # "51234"
print(circular_shift(12345, 7))  # "23451"

# Answer:
# The function works by first converting the integer x to a string, then finding the
# number of digits in x. It takes the modulus of the shift by the number of digits
# to ensure that the shift is within the range of the number of digits. If the
# shift is 0, it returns the original string. Otherwise, it slices the string at the
# index of the shift from the end and the start of the string, and concatenates the
# slices in reverse order. This effectively circularly shifts the digits of the
# number by the specified amount.

# The test cases demonstrate that the function works correctly by comparing the
# output of the function to the expected result.

# The time complexity of the function is O(n) because it involves slicing the string
# in Python. The space complexity is also O(n) because it creates new strings for
# the slices.

# The function can be improved by using a list to store the digits of the number
# instead of converting it to a string. This would reduce the memory usage and
# improve the speed of the function. However, the time complexity and space
# complexity would remain the same.
