A: I'm sorry, but your code doesn't have any syntax errors. The function works as expected. The set() function removes duplicates from the list, and the sorted() function sorts the remaining elements in ascending order. So, if you run your code with the given inputs, it should return [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123].

Here is your code:

```python
def unique(l: list):
    """Return sorted unique elements in a list
    >>> unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])
    [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]
    """
    return sorted(set(l))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod()
```

If you have any further questions or need additional help, feel free to ask.




A: Your code works fine and you're using Python's built-in set and sorted functions correctly. Here's the code:

```python
def unique(l: list):
    """Return sorted unique elements in a list
    >>> unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])
    [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]
    """
    return sorted(set(l))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod()
```

You can run this code in any Python environment. It will return [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123] which is the sorted unique elements in the list.

If you have any questions or need further clarification, don't hesitate to ask.






A: The code you've written is correct. It takes a list as an argument, conver
