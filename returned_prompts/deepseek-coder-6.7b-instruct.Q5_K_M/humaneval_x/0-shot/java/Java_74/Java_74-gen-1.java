A: Your code is almost correct. The only problem is with the calculation of the total number of characters in the strings. You should use the length() method of the String class to get the number of characters in a string. 
Here is the corrected version of your code:
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<String> totalMatch(List<String> lst1, List<String> lst2) {
        int sum1 = 0;
        int sum2 = 0;

        for (String s : lst1) {
            sum1 += s.length();
        }

        for (String s : lst2) {
            sum2 += s.length();
        }

        return sum1 <= sum2 ? lst1 : lst2;
    }
}

This code calculates the total number of characters in the strings in each list by summing up the results of the length() method for each string in the list. It then returns the list with the smaller total number of characters. If the totals are equal, it returns the first list.

A: Here is the corrected version of your code:
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<String> totalMatch(List<String> lst1, List<String> lst2) {
        int sum1 = 0;
        int sum2 = 0;

        for (String s : lst1) {
            sum1 += s.length();
        }

        for (String s : lst2) {
            sum2 += s.length();
        }

        return sum1 <= sum2 ? lst1 : lst2;
    }
}

In your code, you have to use the length() method to get the number of characters in a string. The length() method returns the length of the string
