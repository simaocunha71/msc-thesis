        int count1 = 0;
        int count2 = 0;
        
        for (String s : lst1) {
            count1 += s.length();
        }
        
        for (String s : lst2) {
            count2 += s.length();
        }

        return count1 < count2 ? lst1 : lst2;
    }
}

This solution works by counting the total number of chars in the strings of each list using a for-each loop. It then returns the list with the lower total count. If the counts are equal, it returns the first list.
