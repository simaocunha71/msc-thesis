A: Your solution is correct and efficient. It iterates over both lists and computes the sum of the lengths of the strings in each list. Then it compares the sums and returns the list with the smaller sum. If the sums are equal, it returns the first list.

However, one thing you could improve is the readability of your code. You could use the Java 8 Stream API to make your code more compact and easier to read:

```java
import java.util.List;

public List<String> totalMatch(List<String> lst1, List<String> lst2) {
    int sum1 = lst1.stream().mapToInt(String::length).sum();
    int sum2 = lst2.stream().mapToInt(String::length).sum();
    return sum1 < sum2 ? lst1 : (sum2 < sum1 ? lst2 : lst1);
}
```

This version of the method does essentially the same thing as your original method, but it's written in a more compact and readable way. It uses the `mapToInt` method to convert each string in the list to its length, and then it uses the `sum` method to add up these lengths. Finally, it uses a ternary operator to compare the sums and return the appropriate list.

Also, as a good practice, you could add some null checks to avoid NullPointerExceptions:

```java
import java.util.List;

public List<String> totalMatch(List<String> lst1, List<String> lst2) {
    if (lst1 == null || lst2 == null) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Lists cannot be null");
    }
