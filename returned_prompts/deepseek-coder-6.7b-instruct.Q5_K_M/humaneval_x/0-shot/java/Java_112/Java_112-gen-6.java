    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    HashSet<Character> set = new HashSet<>();
    for (char ch : c.toCharArray()) {
        set.add(ch);
    }
    for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
        if (!set.contains(ch)) {
            sb.append(ch);
        }
    }
    String result = sb.toString();
    boolean isPalindrome = result.equals(new StringBuilder(result).reverse().toString());

    return Arrays.asList(result, isPalindrome);
}

}

The solution starts by creating a StringBuilder object and a HashSet. The HashSet is used to store the characters in the string c. Then it checks if each character in s is in the HashSet. If the character is not in the HashSet, it is appended to the StringBuilder object. 

Finally, it checks if the result string is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse. If they are the same, it is a palindrome and the method returns a list containing the result string and true. If they are not the same, it is not a palindrome and the method returns a list containing the result string and false.

Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n) where n is the length of the string s. This is because it needs to iterate through each character in the string once.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this solution is also O(n) where n is the length of the string s. This is because in the worst case scenario, all characters in the string s are unique and therefore all are added to the HashSet.
