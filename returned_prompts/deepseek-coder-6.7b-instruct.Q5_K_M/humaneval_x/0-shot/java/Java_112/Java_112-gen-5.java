        List<Object> list = new ArrayList<Object>();
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (!c.contains(String.valueOf(ch))) {
                sb.append(ch);
            }
        }
        String result = sb.toString();
        boolean isPalindrome = result.equals(new StringBuilder(result).reverse().toString());
        list.add(result);
        list.add(isPalindrome);
        return list;
    }
}

This Java program will solve the problem. It iterates over the characters of the input string s. If a character is not present in the string c, it's appended to the StringBuilder sb. After that, the characters are converted back to a string and added to the list. The palindrome check is performed and added to the list. The list is then returned.

It's important to note that if the input string s is "abcdedcba" and c is "ab", the result string will be "cdedc" and it's a palindrome, so the boolean value will be true.

The time complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the length of the string s. This is because we iterate over the string s once. The space complexity is also O(n), because we store the result string in memory.

You can use this program to solve the problem and get the desired output.

I hope this helps, and let me know if you have any other questions.

// This is the main function that calls the reverseDelete function and prints the result.

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        List<Object> result = solution.reverseDelete("abcdedcba", "ab");
        System.out.println("Result: " + result.get(0) + ", Is Palindrome: " + result.get(1));
    }
}

// This program will output: Result: cdedc, Is Palindrome: true.
// This means that the result string "cdedc" is a palindrome.
