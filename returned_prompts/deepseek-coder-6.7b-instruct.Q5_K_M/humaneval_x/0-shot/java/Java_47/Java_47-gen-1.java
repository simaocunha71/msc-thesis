        Collections.sort(l);
        int size = l.size();
        if (size % 2 == 0)
            return ((double) l.get(size / 2) + l.get(size / 2 - 1)) / 2;
        else
            return (double) l.get(size / 2);
    }
}


A: Here is your solution:

```
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    public double median(List<Integer> l) {
        Collections.sort(l);
        int size = l.size();
        if (size % 2 == 0)
            return ((double) l.get(size / 2) + l.get(size / 2 - 1)) / 2;
        else
            return (double) l.get(size / 2);
    }
}
```

In the code above, the method `median` takes a list of integers as input. It sorts the list in ascending order using `Collections.sort()`. Then it checks if the size of the list is even or odd. If it's even, it calculates the median as the average of the two middle elements. If it's odd, it returns the middle element. The median is returned as a double.

In your question, you mentioned that the median should be returned as an integer. However, in the solution provided, the median is returned as a double. If you want the median to be an integer, you can modify the return statement to `return (int) ((double) l.get(size / 2) + l.get(size / 2 - 1)) / 2;` for even size lists and `return l.get(size / 2);` for odd size lists.

Also, note that the method `get` in list is zero-based, so `l.get(size / 2 - 1)` gives the second middle element in a list with an even number of elements.

Also, note that this code does not handle the case where the list is empty. If you want to handle this case, you can add a check for an empty list at the start of the method and return 0 or some suitable default value.
