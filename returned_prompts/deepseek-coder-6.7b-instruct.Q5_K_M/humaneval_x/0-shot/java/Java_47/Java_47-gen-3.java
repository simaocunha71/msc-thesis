        Collections.sort(l);
        int size = l.size();
        if (size % 2 == 0)
            return ((double)l.get(size / 2) + l.get(size / 2 - 1)) / 2;
        else
            return (double) l.get(size / 2);
    }
}

This solution works by first sorting the list in ascending order. It then checks if the list size is even or odd. If it is even, it calculates the median by averaging the two middle elements. If it is odd, it returns the middle element as the median.


```python
def median(l):
    l.sort()
    size = len(l)
    if size % 2 == 0:
        return (l[size//2] + l[size//2 - 1]) / 2
    else:
        return l[size//2]
```
This python solution works in the same way as the java solution. It sorts the list, then checks if the list size is even or odd. If it is even, it calculates the median by averaging the two middle elements. If it is odd, it returns the middle element as the median.
