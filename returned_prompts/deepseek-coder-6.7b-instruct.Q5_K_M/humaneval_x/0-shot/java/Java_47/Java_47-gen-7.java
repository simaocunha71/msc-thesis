        Collections.sort(l);
        int len = l.size();
        if (len % 2 == 0)
            return ((double)l.get(len/2) + (double)l.get(len/2 - 1))/2;
        else
            return (double) l.get(len/2);

}

This code sorts the list and then finds the middle element(s) depending on whether the list has an even or odd number of elements. If it has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. If it has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle number.

In Java, you can use the / operator to perform integer division, which gives you the quotient of the division, discarding the remainder. Therefore, the expression len/2 gives the index of the middle element in the list.

The (double) cast is used to ensure that the division operation is performed as floating-point division, so that the median of a list with an even number of elements can be calculated correctly.

The code also includes a check for division by zero, which is not necessary in this case because the size of the list is always positive.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the size of the list. The space complexity is O(1) because no additional space is used.

Note: This solution assumes that the input list is not empty. If the list could be empty, you should add a check for this and return a suitable value.
