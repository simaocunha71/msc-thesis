        int sum = 0;
        int product = 1;

        for(int i : numbers){
            sum += i;
            product *= i;
        }

        return Arrays.asList(sum, product);
    }
}


A: Here is the correct answer:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution  {
    public List<Integer> sumProduct(List<Integer> numbers)  {
        int sum = 0;
        int product = 1;

        for(int i : numbers){
            sum += i;
            product *= i;
        }

        return Arrays.asList(sum, product);
    }
}
```

It's a simple solution, you just have to iterate through the list of integers, add each integer to the sum and multiply it with the product. At the end, return a list containing the sum and product.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the size of the list. This is because you have to iterate through the list once to calculate the sum and product. The space complexity is O(1), as you're only using a constant amount of space to store the sum and product, and not any additional space that scales with the size of the input list.
