        int sum = 0;
        int product = 1;
        
        for(int num : numbers){
            sum += num;
            product *= num;
        }

        return Arrays.asList(sum, product);
    }
}

This solution uses Java's for-each loop to iterate over each number in the given list. For each number, it adds the number to the sum and multiplies the product by the number.
Finally, it returns a list with the sum and product.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the numbers list. The space complexity is O(1) as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the sum and product.

This solution assumes that the input list will only contain integers. If the list can contain other types of numbers or objects, you may need to add error checking to handle those cases.

Also, I assumed that the input list will not be null. If the list can be null, you should add a null check at the beginning of the method to handle that case.

Note: The solution uses Java 8 features, so it will not work on Java 7 or older versions.

Note: The function Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4) is deprecated in Java 9 and removed in Java 10. You should use List.of(1, 2, 3, 4) instead.

Note: In Java, it's not common to use Arrays.asList() in practice. Usually, you'd use a List implementation like ArrayList or LinkedList.

Note: In this solution, the method returns a List<Integer>. If you want to return a tuple, you might want to use a library like Apache Commons Lang or create a custom class to represent the tuple.
