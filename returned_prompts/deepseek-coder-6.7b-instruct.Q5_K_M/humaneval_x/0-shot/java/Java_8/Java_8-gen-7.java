        int sum = 0;
        int product = 1;
        for (int num : numbers) {
            sum += num;
            product *= num;
        }
        return List.of(sum, product);
    }
}

public class Main
{
    public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception
    {
        Solution s = new Solution();
        System.out.println(s.sumProduct(List.of()));
        System.out.println(s.sumProduct(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4)));
    }
}
```

The problem is to calculate the sum and product of a list of integers and return a list containing both values. If the list is empty, the sum should be 0 and the product should be 1. 

This solution uses Java's for-each loop to iterate over the numbers in the list, adding each one to the sum and multiplying it with the product. It then returns a new list containing the sum and product.

The main method tests the sumProduct method with an empty list and a list containing the numbers 1 to 4.

The output of the main method should be:

[0, 1]
[10, 24]

This means that the sum of the empty list is 0 and the product is 1. The sum of the list [1, 2, 3, 4] is 10 and the product is 24.

This solution assumes that the input list will not be null. If the list could be null, you should add a null check at the start of the method.

Note: This solution uses Java 8's List.of() method to create lists. This method is available starting from Java 9. If you're using a version of Java earlier than 9, you should use Arrays.asList() instead.

```java
if (numbers == null) {
    return List.of(0, 1);
}
```
```java
if (numbers == null) {
    return Arrays.asList(0, 1);
}
```

This will return [0, 1] if the input list is null.
