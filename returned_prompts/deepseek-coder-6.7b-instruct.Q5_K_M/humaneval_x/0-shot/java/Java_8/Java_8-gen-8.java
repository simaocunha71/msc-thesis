        int sum = 0;
        int product = 1;
        for(int i=0; i<numbers.size(); i++){
            sum += numbers.get(i);
            product *= numbers.get(i);
        }
        return Arrays.asList(sum, product);
    }
}

The above program is a simple solution to the problem and it will solve it in O(n) time complexity, where n is the size of the list. We're simply iterating through the list once and summing up all the numbers and multiplying all the numbers to get the product. After that, we return a new list with the sum and product.

The problem statement was a bit unclear, but it seems that the solution is correct. The function sumProduct takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of two integers. The first integer is the sum of all numbers in the list and the second integer is the product of all numbers in the list. If the list is empty, the function returns [0, 1].

Let's test the function with some examples:

```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4);
System.out.println(new Solution().sumProduct(numbers)); // prints [10, 24]

List<Integer> empty = new ArrayList<>();
System.out.println(new Solution().sumProduct(empty)); // prints [0, 1]
```

This program should work as expected.

This problem was a good practice for basic operations with lists in Java.
