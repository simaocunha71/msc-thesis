Explanation:
The solution uses dynamic programming. It starts by initializing the first 4 elements of the sequence. Then it computes each element of the sequence by summing the previous 4 elements. This is done in a loop that iterates from 4 to n (inclusive). The n-th element of the sequence is then returned.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), where n is the input number.

Note: This solution assumes that n is a non-negative integer. If n can be a negative number, you should add an additional check at the beginning of the function to handle this case.

This solution is correct and efficient for small values of n. However, for larger values of n, it may exceed the maximum integer value that can be stored in a Java int variable. In this case, you should use a data type that can handle larger values, such as a long or BigInteger.

The space complexity can be optimized to O(1) by only storing the last 4 computed values of the sequence. This would reduce the space complexity of the function. However, it would increase the time complexity to O(n).
