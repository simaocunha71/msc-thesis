The problem is about creating a function that calculates the nth number in a sequence where each number is the sum of the previous four numbers. The numbers in the sequence are 0, 0, 2, 0, 4, 8, 14, 28, and so on. The function uses dynamic programming to store the previously computed numbers in an array, which reduces the time complexity from exponential to linear.

The function first initializes the first four numbers in the sequence. Then it calculates each subsequent number by summing the previous four numbers. The computed numbers are stored in an array for future reference. Finally, it returns the nth number in the sequence.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), and the space complexity is also O(n), where n is the input number.

The function can be used to calculate the nth number in the fib4 number sequence by calling the function with the desired number as the argument. For example, fib4(5) will return 4, fib4(6) will return 8, and so on.

The function handles the edge cases where n is less than 2 by returning 0, and where n is 2 or 3 by returning 2 or 0 respectively. This is because the first two numbers in the sequence are 0, and the third and fourth numbers are 0 and 2, respectively.

The function also handles the edge case where n is 4 by returning 4, because the fifth number in the sequence is 4.

Note that the function uses a zero-
