        if (n == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        if (n == 1) {
            return 0;
        }
        if (n == 2) {
            return 2;
        }
        if (n == 3) {
            return 0;
        }

        int[] fib = new int[n+1];
        fib[0] = 0;
        fib[1] = 0;
        fib[2] = 2;
        fib[3] = 0;

        for (int i = 4; i <= n; i++) {
            fib[i] = fib[i-1] + fib[i-2] + fib[i-3] + fib[i-4];
        }

        return fib[n];
    }
}

The solution to this problem is to use Dynamic Programming. Create an array fib that stores the fib4(i) for each i in the range from 0 to n. The initial four values of the array are given directly as fib[0] = 0, fib[1] = 0, fib[2] = 2, and fib[3] = 0. Then for each i in the range from 4 to n, calculate fib[i] as the sum of the four previous terms in the sequence. Finally, return fib[n]. This solution has a time complexity of O(n).
