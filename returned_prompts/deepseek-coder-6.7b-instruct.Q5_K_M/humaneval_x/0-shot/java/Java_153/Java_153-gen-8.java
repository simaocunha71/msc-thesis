        String strongest = "";
        int maxStrength = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for (String extension : extensions) {
            int strength = countUppercase(extension) - countLowercase(extension);
            if (strength > maxStrength) {
                maxStrength = strength;
                strongest = extension;
            }
        }
        return class_name + "." + strongest;
    }

    private int countUppercase(String s) {
        int count = 0;
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (Character.isUpperCase(c)) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }

    private int countLowercase(String s) {
        int count = 0;
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (Character.isLowerCase(c)) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}

This is a java solution. We are using a method `countUppercase` to count the uppercase letters and `countLowercase` to count the lowercase letters in each extension. The strength of each extension is calculated by subtracting the number of lowercase letters from the number of uppercase letters. We then keep track of the extension with the highest strength. Finally, we return the class name along with the strongest extension.

I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any questions.

This solution assumes that the input list is not empty and each extension is a non-empty string.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n*m), where n is the number of extensions and m is the length of the longest extension. This is because for each extension, we are iterating over all its characters to count the number of uppercase and lowercase letters. The space complexity is O(1), as we are only using a constant amount of space to store the strongest extension and its strength.
