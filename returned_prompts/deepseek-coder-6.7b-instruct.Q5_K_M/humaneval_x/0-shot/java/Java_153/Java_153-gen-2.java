        int maxStrength = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        String strongestExtension = "";

        for (String extension : extensions) {
            int strength = countUpperCase(extension) - countLowerCase(extension);
            if (strength > maxStrength) {
                maxStrength = strength;
                strongestExtension = extension;
            }
        }

        return class_name + "." + strongestExtension;
    }

    private int countUpperCase(String str) {
        int count = 0;
        for (char c : str.toCharArray()) {
            if (Character.isUpperCase(c)) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }

    private int countLowerCase(String str) {
        int count = 0;
        for (char c : str.toCharArray()) {
            if (Character.isLowerCase(c)) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}

This solution works by iterating over the list of extensions, calculating the strength for each one, and storing the extension with the highest strength. The strength of an extension is calculated as the difference between the number of uppercase letters and the number of lowercase letters in the extension's name. The class name and the strongest extension are then returned as a single string.

In the test case "Slices.SErviNGSliCes", "Slices" is the class name and ["SErviNGSliCes", "Cheese", "StuFfed"] are the extensions. "SErviNGSliCes" is the strongest extension because its strength is -1 (count of uppercase letters - count of lowercase letters).

// This solution is written in Java.

// This solution uses the Java programming language's built-in methods for counting uppercase and lowercase letters in a string. The countUpperCase and countLowerCase methods are used to calculate the strength of each extension by subtracting the number of lowercase letters from the number of uppercase letters in the extension's name. The extension with the highest strength is then returned as a string in the format "ClassName.StrongestExtensionName".
