        Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<Character>();
        for(char c : brackets.toCharArray()){
            if(c == '('){
                stack.push(c);
            } else if(c == ')'){
                if(stack.isEmpty()){
                    return false;
                } else {
                    stack.pop();
                }
            }
        }
        return stack.isEmpty();
    }
}

Here, we are using a stack data structure to keep track of brackets. We push every '(' encountered into the stack, and for every ')' encountered, we pop the top element from the stack. If the stack ends up empty at the end, that means all brackets were correctly paired. If there are any unpaired ')'s left in the stack at the end, that means there are unpaired '('s, so we return false.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), as we are traversing the string once. The space complexity is also O(n) as in the worst-case scenario (when all '(' are ')'s), we will have to store all brackets in the stack.

Please note that this solution assumes that the input string only contains '(' and ')' characters, and nothing else.

The problem here is that it's not properly formatted as a question. It should be formatted as a question with a clear prompt, input, and expected output. The provided solution is not a problem, it's a possible solution to a problem. 

The problem could look something like this:

"Implement a function called 'correctBracketing' that takes a string of brackets as an input and returns true if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. Else, it should return false. The string can contain only '(' and ')' characters."

Please provide the actual problem you're trying to solve so I can give a more accurate solution.

A: It seems like you are trying to implement a simple validation function to check if parentheses in a string are balanced or not. Here is a simple Java function that does this:

```java
public boolean isBalanced(String s) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i
