A: The algorithm is correct. 


*

*It initializes an empty stack.

*It traverses the string character by character.

*If it encounters an opening bracket, it pushes it into the stack.

*If it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty.


*

*If it is, it returns false because there is no matching opening bracket for this closing bracket.

*If it's not, it checks the top element of the stack.


*

*If it's an opening bracket, it pops it from the stack.

*If it's not an opening bracket, it pushes the closing bracket into the stack.



*After traversing all characters, if the stack is empty, it means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket and it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false. 


So, the algorithm is correct.

A: The algorithm is correct. It uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets and pops them off when it encounters a corresponding closing bracket. If it encounters a closing bracket when the stack is empty, it returns false because there is no matching opening bracket. If it encounters a closing bracket when the top of the stack is not an opening bracket, it pushes it onto the stack. After it has traversed the entire string, if the stack is empty, it returns true because every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, otherwise it returns false.
