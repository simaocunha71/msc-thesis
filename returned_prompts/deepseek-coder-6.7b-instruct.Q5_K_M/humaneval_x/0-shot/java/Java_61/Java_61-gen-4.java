A: The main idea of this solution is to use a stack to keep track of the brackets. 

Here is the explanation of the code:

1. We start by initializing an empty stack.

2. Then, we iterate over each character in the string. 

3. If the character is an opening bracket "(", we push it onto the stack.

4. If the character is a closing bracket ")", we check if the stack is empty. If it is, then there is no matching opening bracket for this closing bracket, so we return false.

5. If the stack is not empty, we check the top element of the stack. If it is an opening bracket "(", we pop it from the stack. This means we have found a matching pair of brackets.

6. If the top element is not an opening bracket "(", we push the closing bracket onto the stack. This is because there is no matching opening bracket for this closing bracket.

7. After we have processed all the characters in the string, if the stack is empty, this means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so we return true. If the stack is not empty, this means there are unmatched opening brackets, so we return false.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the length of the string and a space complexity of O(n) in the worst case when all the brackets are opening brackets.

The code you provided seems to be correct according to the problem statement.

Here is the corrected version of your code:

```java
import java.util.*;
