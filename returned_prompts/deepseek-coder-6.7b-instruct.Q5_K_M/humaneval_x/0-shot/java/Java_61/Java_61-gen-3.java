This solution uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. If it encounters a closing bracket and the stack is empty, it returns false since there is no matching opening bracket. If it encounters a closing bracket and the top of the stack is an opening bracket, it pops it off the stack. If the top of the stack is not an opening bracket, it pushes the closing bracket onto the stack. Finally, it returns true if the stack is empty, meaning every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. If the stack is not empty, it returns false.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) where n is the length of the string, because it processes each character in the string once. The space complexity is also O(n) because in the worst case (when all characters are opening brackets), the stack will hold all of them.

The solution assumes that the input string is well-formed, i.e., every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. If the input string could be malformed, additional error checking would be needed.

A: You've missed the start of the Javadoc comment. It should be:
/**
 * brackets is a string of "(" and ")".
 * return True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

 * false
 * >>> correctBracketing("()")
 * true
 * >>> correctBracketing("(()())")
 * true
