A: It's a bit unclear what you're asking, but it looks like you want to sum all the odd numbers in the list that are in even positions. If that's the case, then your solution is correct.

Here's a breakdown of your solution:

- A variable sum is initialized to 0.
- A for loop is used to iterate through each element in the list (with i being the index of the current element).
- The condition in the for loop checks two things:
  - The index of the current element (i) is even (i % 2 == 0).
  - The value of the current element is odd (lst.get(i) % 2 != 0).
- If the current element meets both conditions, it is added to sum.
- After the loop finishes, sum is returned.

If your question is different, please provide more details.
