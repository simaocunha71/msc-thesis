        for (int i = 0; i < lst.size(); i++) {
            if (i % 2 == 0 && lst.get(i) % 2 == 1) {
                sum += lst.get(i);

A: Here's how you can solve it:

*

*Initialize a variable sum to 0. This will hold the sum of all odd elements that are in even positions.


*Iterate over the list using a for loop. In the loop, check if the current index is even (i.e., i % 2 == 0) and if the element at the current index in the list is odd (i.e., lst.get(i) % 2 == 1). If both conditions are met, add the element to the sum.


*Return the sum.


*Note: In Java, indices start at 0. So, in an even-length list, the first position is 0, the second is 1, and so on. In an odd-length list, the first position is 0, the second is 1, and so on, but the last one is length-1.


*Also, remember that the modulo operator (%) gives the remainder of a division operation. So, a number is even if its remainder is 0, and a number is odd if its remainder is 1.


*Finally, if the list is empty or there are no odd elements in even positions, the function should return 0 as per the problem statement.


*Also, keep in mind that the function should return the sum of all odd elements in even positions, not the sum of all elements.


*Also, keep in mind that the function should only consider even-indexed elements, not the element at the 0th index, because in programming, indices start at 0. So, in the list [5, 8, 7, 1], the only even-indexed element is 5, not 8, 7, or 1.


*Also, keep in mind that the function should consider only even-numbered elements, not odd-numbered ones, because the problem statement says to consider "
