        int length = string.length();
        if (length < 2) {
            return false;
        }
        for (int i = 2; i * i <= length; i++) {
            if (length % i == 0) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}


A: The function primeLength checks whether the length of the string is a prime number. It does this by iterating from 2 through the square root of the length of the string, checking if any of those numbers divide evenly into the length of the string. If any number does, it returns false. If no numbers divide evenly, it returns true, indicating that the length is prime.

The reason we only need to check up to the square root of the length is that a larger factor of the number would be a multiple of a smaller factor that has already been checked.

The reason we need to check at least 2 is that 1 is not a prime number, and if the length of the string is 1, the function would return false.

The reason we need to check at most the square root of the length is that if the length of the string is not a prime number, it will have a factor less than or equal to the square root.

So, the function primeLength checks if the length of the string is a prime number or not.

Example:

primeLength("Hello") returns true because the length of "Hello" is 5 which is a prime number.
primeLength("abcdcba") returns true because the length of "abcdcba" is 7 which is a prime number.
primeLength("kittens") returns true because the length of "kittens" is 7 which is a prime number.
primeLength("orange") returns false because the length of "orange" is 6 which is not a prime number.

So, the function is correct.

I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.
