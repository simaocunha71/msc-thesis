        int len = string.length();
        if(len < 2) return false;
        for(int i = 2; i * i <= len; i++) {
            if(len % i == 0) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}

The function works by first checking if the length of the string is less than 2. If it is, it returns false since strings of length less than 2 cannot be prime. If the string's length is 2 or more, it enters a loop that starts at 2 and continues as long as the square of the current number is less than or equal to the length of the string. For each iteration of the loop, it checks if the length of the string is divisible by the current number. If it is, it returns false because the string's length is not prime. If the loop completes without finding a divisor, it returns true because the string's length is prime.

In the case of "Hello", the length is 5, which is prime, so it returns true. In the case of "abcdcba", the length is 7, which is not prime, so it returns false.

A: The given problem is actually a Java code snippet. It is a method named primeLength() which checks whether the length of a given string is a prime number or not.

Here is a brief explanation of the code:

- The function takes a String as an input.
- The length of the string is calculated using the length() method.
- If the length is less than 2, the function returns false as strings of length less than 2 cannot be prime.
- Then a for loop is started which checks for factors of the length of the string. It starts from 2 and goes up to the square root of the length. This is because a larger factor of the number would be a multiple of smaller factor that has already been checked.
- Inside the loop, if the length is divisible by the current number (i), the function returns false.
- If the loop completes without finding any factors, the function returns true, indicating that the length of the string is prime.

Please note that this code is not complete, there seems to be a missing closing brace '}' in the code.

Hope this helps.
