Explanation:
This function first checks if the length of the string is less than 2. If it is, then it is not a prime number, so the function returns false.
Next, the function enters a for loop that starts at 2 and continues until it has checked all numbers up to the length of the string. If the length of the string is divisible by any number in this range, it is not a prime number, so the function returns false.
If the function has not returned false at this point, then the length of the string must be a prime number, so the function returns true.
