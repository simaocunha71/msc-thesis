I'm sorry, but your question has some errors. The function CompareOne should be able to compare numbers regardless of their type, but you've specified that the function takes integers, floats, or strings representing real numbers. I assume that this means that it should also handle strings that can be converted to numbers.

Let's correct your function to handle these cases:

```go
func CompareOne(a, b interface{}) interface{} {
    var aFloat, bFloat float64
    var aOk, bOk bool

    // Try to convert a and b to float64
    aFloat, aOk = a.(float
