This program calculates `2^n mod p` using the modulus operation. It returns `n` if `n` is less than `p`, otherwise it returns the remainder of `n/p`. 

The problem with the given code is that it always returns `n`, no matter what the values of `n` and `p` are. The correct code should be as follows:

```java
