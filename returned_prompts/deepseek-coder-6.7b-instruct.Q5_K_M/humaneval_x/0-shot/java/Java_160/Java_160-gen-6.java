        int result = operand.get(0);

B:
        for (int i = 1; i < operand.size(); i++) {
            switch (operator.get(i - 1)) {
                case "+":
                    result += operand.get(i);
                    break;
                case "-":
                    result -= operand.get(i);
                    break;
                case "*":
                    result *= operand.get(i);
                    break;
                case "/":
                    result /= operand.get(i);
                    break;
                case "**":
                    result = (int) Math.pow(result, operand.get(i));
                    break;
            }
        }

C:
        return result;
    }
}

This code does exactly what is asked in the problem description. It first initializes the result to the first element of the operand list. Then it iterates over the rest of the operand list, applying the appropriate operator from the operator list to the current result and the current operand. The result is then returned.

If you have any questions about this code, please let me know.
