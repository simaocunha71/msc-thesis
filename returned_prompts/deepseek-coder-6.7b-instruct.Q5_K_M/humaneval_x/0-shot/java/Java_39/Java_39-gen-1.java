Explanation:
This Java code uses a while loop to generate Fibonacci numbers and checks if each number is prime using the isPrime function. If it is prime, it increments a count variable. The loop stops when the count variable equals the input parameter n. The Fibonacci number that satisfies the condition is returned.
The isPrime function checks if a number is prime by dividing it by all numbers up to its square root. If the number is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime. If it is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime.
The primeFib function returns the n-th prime Fibonacci number.
Time complexity: O(n^2)
Space complexity: O(1)
