A: The code you have provided is correct for finding the n-th Fibonacci number that is also a prime. The code uses a while loop to iterate over the Fibonacci sequence. In each iteration, it checks if the current Fibonacci number is prime. If it is, it increments the count. When the count equals n, it returns the current Fibonacci number.

The isPrime function checks if a number is prime. It returns false if the number is less than or equal to 1. If the number is greater than 1, it checks if it is divisible by any number up to the square root of the number. If it is divisible, it returns false. If it is not divisible by any number, it is a prime number and it returns true.

The time complexity of the code is O(n*sqrt(m)), where n is the input number and m is the n-th Fibonacci number. This is because for each Fibonacci number, it checks if it is prime by trying to divide it by all numbers up to its square root.

The space complexity of the code is O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the Fibonacci numbers and the count.

So, the code is correct and efficient for finding the n-th Fibonacci number that is also a prime.

However, the code can be optimized. The current code uses a while loop to find the n-th Fibon
