        int[] sides = {a, b, c};
        Arrays.sort(sides);
        return Math.pow(sides[0], 2) + Math.pow(sides[1], 2) == Math.pow(sides[2], 2);
    }
}


A: Here is the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution  {
    /**
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return true if the three
    sides form a right-angled triangle, false otherwise.
    A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or
    90 degree.
    Example:
    rightAngleTriangle(3, 4, 5) == true
    rightAngleTriangle(1, 2, 3) == false
      */
    public boolean rightAngleTriangle(int a, int b, int c) {
        int[] sides = {a, b, c};
        Arrays.sort(sides);
        return Math.pow(sides[0], 2) + Math.pow(sides[1], 2) == Math.pow(sides[2], 2);
    }
}
```

This solution sorts the sides of the triangle and then checks if the square of the smallest side (which is the hypotenuse) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. If this is the case, then the three sides form a right-angled triangle, so the method returns true. If not, the method returns false.

Remember to always use Math.pow() to square numbers in Java, as the '^' operator does not work as expected for non-integer powers.

Also note that this solution assumes that the input values are always valid triangle sides lengths. If this is not the case, you should add error checking to handle invalid inputs.

Hope this helps, happy coding !
