        // sort the lengths of the sides
        int[] sides = {a, b, c};
        Arrays.sort(sides);

        // check if the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides

A: 
The hypotenuse is the side opposite the right angle, and it is equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

Since you're given the lengths of the three sides, you can check if the triangle is right-angled by comparing the square of the hypotenuse to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

If the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides, then the triangle is right-angled.

So, the code is checking if the square of the longest side (the hypotenuse) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. If it is, then the triangle is right-angled, and the method returns true. If not, the method returns false.

Here's the corrected version of your code:

```java
public boolean rightAngleTriangle(int a, int b, int c) {
    // sort the lengths of the sides
    int[] sides = {a, b, c};
    Arrays.sort(sides);

    // check if the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides
    return Math.pow(sides[2], 2) == Math.pow(sides[0], 2) + Math.pow(sides[1], 2);
}
```
This code works by first sorting the lengths of the sides in ascending order. Then it checks if the square of the longest side (the hypotenuse) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. If it is, then the triangle is right-angled, and the method returns true. If not, the method returns false.

I hope this helps, let me know if you have any other questions.
