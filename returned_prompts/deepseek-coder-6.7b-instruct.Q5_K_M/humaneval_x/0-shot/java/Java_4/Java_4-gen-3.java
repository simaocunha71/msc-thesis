This solution uses Java and calculates the mean absolute deviation of a given list of numbers. It first calculates the mean of the numbers, then calculates the absolute deviation of each number from the mean and sums these deviations. Finally, it returns the mean of these absolute deviations.
The time complexity of this solution is O(n) and the space complexity is O(1).

The provided solution is correct and the program will output 1.0.
