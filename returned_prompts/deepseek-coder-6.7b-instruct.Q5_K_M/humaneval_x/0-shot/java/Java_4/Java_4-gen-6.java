A: The mean absolute deviation (MAD) is calculated as the average of the absolute differences from the mean. So first we calculate the mean of the given numbers, then we calculate the absolute difference from the mean for each number, and finally we calculate the average of these absolute differences.

So, in your code, you have correctly calculated the sum of the numbers and the mean. The next step is to calculate the absolute differences from the mean. You did this correctly by iterating through the numbers again and subtracting the mean from each number. 

The final step is to calculate the average of these absolute differences. This is done by dividing the sum of the absolute differences by the number of elements.

So, your code is correct and you should get the result you expected.

Another thing to note is that you should consider handling the case where the input list is empty. The mean of an empty list is undefined, and calculating the mean absolute deviation in such a case would lead to a division by zero error. You can add a check at the beginning of the method to handle this case.

Here's your code with that check added:

```java
public double meanAbsoluteDeviation(List<Double> numbers) {
    if (numbers.isEmpty()) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Input list cannot be empty");
    }

    double sum = 0;
    double mean = 0;
    double mad = 0;

    for(double num : numbers){
        sum += num;
    }

    mean = sum / numbers.size();

    for(double num : numbers){
        mad +=
