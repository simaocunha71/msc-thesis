        double sum = 0.0;
        double mean;
        for(double num : numbers) {
            sum += num;
        }
        mean = sum / numbers.size();

        double mad = 0.0;
        for(double num : numbers) {
            mad += Math.abs(num - mean);
        }
        return mad / numbers.size();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Double> numbers = Arrays.asList(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0);
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.meanAbsoluteDeviation(numbers));
    }
}

```

**Explanation:**

The meanAbsoluteDeviation function works as follows:

1. It first calculates the mean of the numbers.
2. Then, it calculates the mean absolute deviation by iterating over the list of numbers and adding the absolute difference between each number and the mean to a running total.
3. Finally, it returns the mean absolute deviation, which is the total sum divided by the number of elements in the list.

The main function creates a list of Double objects and calls the meanAbsoluteDeviation function with this list. The result is then printed to the console.

```

**Output:**

```
1.0
```

```

The output is the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of the list [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0], which is 1.0.

```

```

**Note:**

In this solution, we are using Java's built-in `List` interface and its implementation `ArrayList` class. We are also using Java's built-in `Math` class for the `abs` function.
