        double sum = 0.0;
        double mean = 0.0;
        double mad = 0.0;

        for(double num : numbers){
            sum += num;
        }

        mean = sum/numbers.size();

        for(double num: numbers){
            mad += Math.abs(num - mean);
        }

        return mad/numbers.size();
    }
}

This solution computes the mean of the input numbers first, then calculates the absolute difference of each number and the mean, and finally averages these differences to get the Mean Absolute Deviation.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.

Here, the space complexity is O(1), because we are using a constant amount of space to store our sum, mean, and mad variables.

This solution is assuming that the input list is not empty. If it can be empty, you should add a check for it before proceeding with the calculation.

Also, this solution does not handle potential precision issues that may arise from the use of double for the calculations. If precision is a concern, consider using BigDecimal instead.

// Solution ends

// Test starts
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.meanAbsoluteDeviation(Arrays.asList(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0)));
    }
}
// Test ends
```

This test class creates an instance of the Solution class and then calls the `meanAbsoluteDeviation` method with an example list of numbers. The result is then printed to the console.

Please note that you must import the `java.util.Arrays` and `java.util.List` packages to use the `Arrays.asList` method in the test class.

Also, the class name for the test class is Test. You can change it to suit your needs.

Please ensure you have the necessary JDK installed to run this code.

Remember to run the test class to see the result.

This code should work as expected and
