        double sum = 0;
        double mean;
        double mad = 0;

        for (double num : numbers) {
            sum += num;
        }

        mean = sum / numbers.size();

        for (double num : numbers) {
            mad += Math.abs(num - mean);
        }

        return mad / numbers.size();
    }
}

This solution first calculates the mean of the input numbers, then calculates the absolute difference between each number and the mean, sums all these up and divides by the number of elements to get the Mean Absolute Deviation.

Here, in the list of numbers, the mean is 2.5 and the absolute differences from the mean are [1.5, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5] so the MAD is (1.5 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2.5) / 4 = 1.5.
So, the function should return 1.5.

The numbers [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0] do not have a mean of 2.5, but you could still use this function to calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation.

The function is also not able to handle the case where the list is empty as it will throw an error. You may want to add a condition to check if the list is empty before proceeding to the calculation.

Also, it will throw an error if the list contains any non-numeric values as it is not capable of handling non-numeric data types. You may want to add a condition to check if all the elements in the list are numeric before proceeding to the calculation.

I hope this explanation is clear enough.

Please note that this solution assumes that the input list is not empty and contains only numeric values. If this is not the case, you might want to add some error checking code to handle these cases.
