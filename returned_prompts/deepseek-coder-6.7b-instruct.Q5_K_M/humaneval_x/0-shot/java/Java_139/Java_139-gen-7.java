This is a Java program that calculates the special factorial of a number. The specialFactorial method calculates the special factorial by multiplying the factorial of the current number and the factorial of the previous numbers. The result is stored in the result variable and returned at the end.

The main method creates an instance of the Solution class and calls the specialFactorial method with the argument 4, printing the result to the console.

This program uses a for loop to calculate the special factorial. The loop variable i is used to calculate the factorial of each number from 1 to n. The factorial of the current number is multiplied with the factorial of the previous numbers and the result is stored in the result variable.

Finally, the value of the result variable is returned.

The time complexity of this program is O(n) because it performs a single loop from 1 to n. The space complexity is O(1) because it uses a constant amount of space to store the result and the factorial.

The specialFactorial method should work correctly for positive integers, but it may not work correctly for large inputs due to the limitations of the long data type in Java.
