        long result = 1;
        for(int i = n; i > 0; i--){
            long factorial = 1;
            for(int j = 1; j <= i; j++){
                factorial *= j;
            }
            result *= factorial;
        }

        return result;
    }
}

This solution works by first calculating the factorial of the input number, n. This is done by creating a loop that starts at n and decrements by 1 each time, multiplying the result by the current value of j in the inner loop. The factorial is then multiplied by the result of the inner loop. This process is repeated until the inner loop has gone through the entire range from n to 1. The final result is then returned. 

Note: This solution may not work for large values of n due to the limitations of the long data type. For very large inputs, you may need to use a library or a data type that supports larger numbers.

Also, this solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested loop structure. This means that it may perform poorly for larger inputs.

For calculating larger factorials, you may want to consider using a more efficient algorithm or a library that supports large numbers.

Please note that this solution does not take into account the fact that the factorial function grows very rapidly and quickly exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by the long data type, even for relatively small inputs. If you need to calculate the factorial for very large numbers, you should use a data type that can handle arbitrarily large numbers, such as BigInteger.
