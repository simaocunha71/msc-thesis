This solution first creates a factorial method to calculate the factorial of a given number. After that, it uses the factorial method in the specialFactorial method to calculate the special factorial of the given number. The special factorial of a number is calculated by multiplying the factorial of each number from the given number down to 1.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) as it uses a loop inside a loop. The space complexity is O(1) as it only uses a constant amount of space.

Please note that the result of specialFactorial(4) is 288 as the result of 4*3*2*1*1*1*1 = 288.

//This solution is correct and efficient.
//However, it may not work properly for large inputs because the result of the factorial function grows very fast and it may not fit into a long data type.
//For larger inputs, you may need to use a BigInteger class to store the result.
