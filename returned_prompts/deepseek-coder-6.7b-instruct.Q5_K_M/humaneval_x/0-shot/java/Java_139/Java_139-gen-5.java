This program calculates the special factorial of a given number by multiplying the factorial of each number from 1 to n. The result is stored in the variable "result". The factorial is calculated by multiplying the current number and the previous factorial, which is stored in the variable "fact". At the end of each loop iteration, the current factorial is multiplied with the result, updating the result. 

In the main method, the specialFactorial method is called with the argument 4, and the result is printed to the console. The output is 288, which is the special factorial of 4.
