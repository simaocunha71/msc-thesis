    public long factorial(int n) {
        long result = 1;

Here, I have implemented two methods. The first method specialFactorial takes an integer n and calculates the special factorial using the method factorial. The factorial method calculates the factorial of a number and returns it.
The time complexity of this solution is O(n).

// Time Complexity: O(n)
// Space Complexity: O(1)

// Note: This solution assumes that the input is a positive integer. If the input can be negative or zero, you would need to add appropriate error checking.

// Note: The factorial of a number grows very fast. For example, the factorial of 20 is 2,432,902,008,176,640,000. Therefore, for large inputs, this solution can cause an integer overflow error. In such cases, you would need to use a data type that can handle large numbers, such as BigInteger.

// Note: This solution uses a simple loop to calculate the factorial. This could be optimized by using memoization or dynamic programming, which could reduce the time complexity to O(n) from O(n!). However, these techniques are more complex and may not be necessary for this problem.

// Note: The problem statement is a bit ambiguous. It seems that the special factorial of a number is the product of the factorials of all numbers from the number down to 1. However, the problem statement also mentions the special factorial of a number n
