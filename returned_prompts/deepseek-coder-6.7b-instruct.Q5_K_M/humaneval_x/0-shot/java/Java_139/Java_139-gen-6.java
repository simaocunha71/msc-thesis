This is a Java solution for the problem. The method specialFactorial computes the special factorial of a given integer n. It uses a nested loop to compute each factorial and multiply it with the result. The final result is the special factorial of the input.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) as for each number from n to 1, we are computing its factorial which itself takes O(n) time. The space complexity is O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of space to store our result.

The constraints of this problem are that n will be at most 100.

Please note that this solution may not be the most efficient one, especially for large values of n due to the high computational complexity of factorial computations. For larger values of n, you may need to use a more efficient algorithm or data structure to compute the factorial.
