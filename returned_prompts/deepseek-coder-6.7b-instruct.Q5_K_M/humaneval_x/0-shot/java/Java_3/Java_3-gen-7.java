        int balance = 0;
        for(Integer op : operations){
            balance += op;
            if(balance < 0) return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}

Explanation:
This program goes through the list of operations, adding each one to the running balance. If at any point the balance goes below zero, the function immediately returns True. If the function has gone through all the operations and the balance has never gone below zero, it returns False.


This is a simple problem that can be solved in linear time, since we just need to go through the list once. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of operations. The space complexity is O(1), as we only need a single integer to keep track of the balance.


Here is the python solution:

```python
def below_zero(operations):
    balance = 0
    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0: return True
    return False
```

The logic of the solution is the same as the Java solution, just written in Python syntax.


This solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), where n is the number of operations.


The time complexity is O(n) because we're going through the list of operations once. The space complexity is O(1) because we're only using a single integer to keep track of the balance.


The solution works by iterating through the list of operations, updating the balance at each step. If the balance ever goes below zero, the function immediately returns True. If the function gets through the whole list without the balance going below zero, it returns False.


This solution assumes that the list of operations is a list of integers, where each integer is an amount to add to the balance (positive for deposit, negative for withdrawal).


This solution also assumes that the list of operations is not empty. If the list could be empty, we would need to handle that case separately.


This solution also assumes that the operations are performed in the order they appear in the list. If the operations could be performed out of order, we would need to adjust the solution accordingly.


This solution also assumes that the balance can only go below zero if a withdrawal operation is performed
