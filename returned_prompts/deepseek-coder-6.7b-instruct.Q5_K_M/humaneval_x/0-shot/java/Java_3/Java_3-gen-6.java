        for(Integer op : operations){
            sum += op;

A: This is a simple task and can be done with a single pass through the data, checking the running total to see if it ever drops below zero. If it does, the function returns true. If it never does, it returns false. The running total is computed by adding the current operation to the total and then checking if the new total is less than zero.

Here is a more detailed explanation:

*

*Initialize a variable sum to 0. This will keep track of the running total of the operations.

*Iterate over the list of operations.

*In each iteration, add the current operation to the running total.

*Check if the running total is less than 0. If it is, return true because the balance fell below zero at some point.

*If the running total is never less than 0, return false because the balance never fell below zero.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the number of operations.

Note: It is important to clarify that the question asks to return true if the balance falls below zero at any point, not if it stays below zero for a period of time.
