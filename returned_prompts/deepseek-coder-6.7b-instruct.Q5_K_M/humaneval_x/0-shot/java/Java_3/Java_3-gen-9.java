public class Main {

        System.out.println(sol.belowZero(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3))); // false

The solution to the problem is to loop through the list of operations and for each operation update the balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, the function returns True, else it continues to the end of the list and returns False.

This solution is correct because it loops through the list of operations only once, so it has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the list. It also updates the balance for each operation in constant time, so it has a space complexity of O(1).

The function correctly implements the requirements of the problem statement. It correctly checks if the balance ever falls below zero and returns the appropriate boolean value accordingly.

The code also correctly handles edge cases. For example, if the list of operations is empty, the function correctly returns False. If the list only contains operations that do not cause the balance to fall below zero, the function correctly returns False.

So, the code is correct and efficient.

The code also follows the Java code conventions. It uses meaningful variable names, it uses camel case for variable names, it uses curly braces to denote the start and end of code blocks, and it uses a space between keywords and their arguments. It also uses Javadoc comments to explain the purpose of the code.

The code also uses Java's standard conventions for naming conventions for classes and methods. It uses camel case for the class name, and it uses upper camel case for the method name.

The code is well-organized and easy to read. It is well-structured and follows the standard coding conventions.

So, the solution is correct, efficient,
