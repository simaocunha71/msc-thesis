        int balance = 0;
        for(int op : operations){
            balance += op;
            if(balance < 0){
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}

The above code works by iterating through the list of operations, adding each operation to the current balance. If the balance ever drops below zero, the function returns true. If the function gets through the whole list without finding a negative balance, it returns false.

This solution runs in O(n) time, where n is the number of operations. This is because it iterates through the list of operations once.

It also runs in O(1) space, as it only uses a single integer to keep track of the current balance. This integer does not grow with the size of the input list, so the space usage is constant.

I hope this helps, and I'm sorry if there are any misunderstandings.
