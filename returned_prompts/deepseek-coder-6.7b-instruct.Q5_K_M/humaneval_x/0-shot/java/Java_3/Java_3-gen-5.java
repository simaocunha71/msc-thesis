        int balance = 0;

        for (Integer operation : operations) {
            balance += operation;
            if (balance < 0) {
                return true;
            }
        }

        return false;
    }
}


A: Correct, the solution is correct. The Java code checks every operation in the list and adds it to the balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, it returns true. If the balance never falls below zero, it returns false. 

In the first example, the balance increases to 1, then to 3, so there's no time when the balance is negative and the function should return true. 

In the second example, the balance increases to 3, then decreases to -1, so the function should return true. 

So the solution is correct.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of operations. This is because it must iterate through each operation once. The space complexity is O(1), as it only uses a single integer variable to keep track of the balance.
