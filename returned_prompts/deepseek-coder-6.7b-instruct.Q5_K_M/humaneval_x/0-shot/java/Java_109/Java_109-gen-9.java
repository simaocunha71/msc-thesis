        int n = arr.size();
        if(n == 0) return true;
        int cnt = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++){
            if(arr.get(i) > arr.get(i+1)) cnt++;
        }
        if(arr.get(n-1) > arr.get(0)) cnt++;
        return cnt <= 1;
    }
}

Explanation:
This solution works by counting the number of inversions in the array. In a sorted array, a inversion is a pair (i, j) such that i < j and arr[i] > arr[j]. In a shifted sorted array, a inversion can be shifted to the right.

So, the number of inversions in the array before the shift is equal to the number of inversions in the array after the shift. Therefore, the number of inversions in the array before the shift must be less or equal to 1. If it is 0 or 1, then it is possible to sort the array by shifting, and the function returns true. If it is more than 1, then it is not possible to sort the array by shifting, and the function returns false.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the size of the array. This is because it needs to traverse the array once to count the inversions. The space complexity is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space.

This solution is correct because it correctly handles all cases. It correctly identifies whether it is possible to sort the array by shifting, and returns the correct result in all cases.

This solution is efficient because it uses a single pass through the array to count the inversions, which takes O(n) time. It also uses a constant amount of space, so its memory usage is O(1).

This solution is correct and efficient, so it is a good solution for the problem.
