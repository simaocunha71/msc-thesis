A: The solution is based on the fact that we are allowed to perform the right shift operation any number of times. Therefore, the array can be sorted by shifting elements to the right. This operation can be performed zero or one times to sort the array. 

So, what we do here is count the number of inversions in the array. An inversion is defined as any pair of elements in the array where the first element is greater than the second one.

We also need to consider the case where the last element is greater than the first one. This is because we are allowed to perform the right shift operation, which means that the last element can be moved to the first position.

Finally, we return whether the count of inversions is 0 or 1. This is because we can sort the array by performing the right shift operation zero or one times.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array, because we need to iterate over the array once. The space complexity is O(1), because we only use a constant amount of space to store the count of inversions and the length of the array.

This solution works for arrays of any size, including empty arrays.

This solution assumes that the array contains unique elements as per the problem statement.

So, in your examples:

moveOneBall(Arrays.asList(3, 4, 5, 1, 2)) returns true, because it's possible to sort the array by performing one right shift operation.

moveOneBall(Arrays.asList(3, 5, 4, 1, 2)) returns false, because it's not possible to sort the array by performing any number of right shift operations.

This solution works for all test cases provided in the problem statement.

The solution provided is a simple and efficient
