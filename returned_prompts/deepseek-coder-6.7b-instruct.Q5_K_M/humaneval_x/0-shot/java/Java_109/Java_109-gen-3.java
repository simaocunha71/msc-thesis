This problem is a variation of the classical array rotation problem. The idea is to find the first point in the array where the next number is smaller than the current number. This point represents the breakpoint in the array. After this point, the array is rotated. We then check if the array is already sorted (without any rotation) after the breakpoint or if the array can be sorted by performing a rotation.

In the solution, we first find the breakpoint. If there is no breakpoint, the array is already sorted. If there is a breakpoint, we check if the array can be sorted by performing a rotation.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), as we need to traverse the array at least once. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space.

The code checks if it's possible to sort the array by performing a right shift operation. If it is, the function returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

The function takes a list of integers as input and returns a boolean value.

The function first checks if the size of the list is 0 or 1. If it is, the function returns true because an empty or one-element list is already sorted. If the size of the list is
