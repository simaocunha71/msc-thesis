A: The code is checking the number of times that the current element is greater than the next one in the array. If this number is more than 1, it means that we have more than one "corner" where the array is not sorted. Therefore, it is not possible to sort the array by performing right shift operations.

The last part is to check if the last element of the array is greater than the first one. If it is, we have one "corner" where the array is not sorted.

If the number of "corners" is less or equal to 1, it means that we can sort the array by performing right shift operations.

So, the answer is correct.

A: Yes, the code is correct and the logic is correct as well. The code is checking if the given list can be sorted by performing right shift operations. If there is more than one "corner" where the list is not sorted, it returns false, otherwise true.
