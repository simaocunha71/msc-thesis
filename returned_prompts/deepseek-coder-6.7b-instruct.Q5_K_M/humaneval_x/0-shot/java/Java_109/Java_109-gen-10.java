            }
        }

        if (arr.get(arr.size() - 1) > arr.get(0))

A: This is a typical question about array rotation. You just need to count the number of disordered pairs in the array. If the number of disordered pairs is 0 or 1, then it is possible to sort the array by rotating it.
Here is the code:
public boolean moveOneBall(List<Integer> arr) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
        if (arr.get(i) > arr.get((i + 1) % arr.size())) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count <= 1;
}

In this code, I use the modulo operator to handle the rotation. If the array is [3, 4, 5, 1, 2], the rotated array will be [2, 3, 4, 5, 1], and the count of disordered pairs will be 2. The time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the size of the array.

A: This is a variation of a problem known as array rotation. The idea is to count the number of points of discontinuity in the array. A point of discontinuity is a pair of elements (arr[i], arr[i+1]) where arr[i] > arr[i+1]. If there are 0 or 1 such points, it is possible to sort the array by performing at most one right rotation.

Here's a Python solution:

```python
def moveOneBall(arr):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] > arr[(i + 1) % len(arr)]:
            count += 1
    return
