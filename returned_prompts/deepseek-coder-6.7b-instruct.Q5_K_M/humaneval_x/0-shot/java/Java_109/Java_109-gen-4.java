This Java program works by counting the number of times a number in the list is greater than the next number. If this count is more than 1, return false. Otherwise, return true. This is because a right shift operation can move the maximum of two elements to the beginning of the array. Therefore, at most one right shift operation is enough to sort the array in non-decreasing order.

The time complexity of this program is O(n) as it iterates through the list once. The space complexity is O(1) as it uses a constant amount of space.

Please note that this program assumes that the given list is a permutation of the first n natural numbers, where n is the size of the list.

This solution is based on the assumption that the array can be sorted by performing at most one right shift operation. If this assumption is not correct, the solution may not work correctly.

Please note that the given list is guaranteed to have unique elements, which means there are no duplicate elements in the list.

If the given list is empty, the function will return true.
