        return (n*(n-1))/2; // n cars moving in opposite directions, so for every pair of cars they collide.
    }

}

Here we are using the formula for the number of combinations of 2 objects out of n. The total number of ways to choose 2 cars from n is n*(n-1)/2.

This solution can handle large inputs as well, because it uses a constant amount of memory and works in O(1) time. It does not depend on the size of the input.

Here is a Java function that takes an integer n and returns the number of collisions. The function uses the formula for the number of combinations of 2 out of n. The total number of ways to choose 2 cars from n is n*(n-1)/2.

/*
Here is the explanation of the approach:

We are given that there are n cars moving left to right and n cars moving right to left.
Since these cars are moving in opposite directions, they will always collide. 

The number of collisions can be calculated by using the formula for combinations. 

The formula for combinations is n*(n-1)/2. This formula calculates the total number of ways to choose 2 objects out of n. 

In this case, we are choosing 2 cars out of n. So, the total number of ways to choose 2 cars out of n is n*(n-1)/2.

This is the logic behind the code. We simply return this value.
