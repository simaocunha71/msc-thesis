        //if n equals to 1, return 0
        if(n == 1){
            return 0;
        }

        return n * (n-1) / 2;

This is a simple problem that can be solved by using the properties of number theory. It is based on the fact that for each car that is moving right to left, there are n-1 cars that are moving left to right that it can collide with. Therefore, the total number of collisions is the sum of the collisions for each car.

This can be calculated as n * (n-1) / 2. The /2 part is because each collision is counted twice (once for each car). This is a mathematical formula that can be derived from the problem statement.

This solution has a time complexity of O(1) and a space complexity of O(1), which means it uses constant space and does not depend on the size of the input.

Testing the code:

The code should pass the following tests:

- carRaceCollision(0) should return 0
- carRaceCollision(1) should return 0
- carRaceCollision(2) should return 1
- carRaceCollision(3) should return 3
- carRaceCollision(4) should return 6
- carRaceCollision(5) should return 10
- carRaceCollision(10) should return 45
- carRaceCollision(100) should return 4950
