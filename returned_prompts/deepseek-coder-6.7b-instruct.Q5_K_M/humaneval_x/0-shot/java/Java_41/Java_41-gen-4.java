        return n * n;
    }
}


A: It's not the number of collisions, but the number of collisions that can occur. For example, if n = 2 cars are moving from left to right and 2 cars are moving from right to left, there will be 4 collisions. This is because each car from the left will collide with each car from the right. Therefore, the total number of collisions is n * n.

This problem can be solved by the brute-force method, but it's more efficient to solve it using the formula n * n.

This is because there are n cars moving from the left, and there are n cars moving from the right. Therefore, there are n * n possible pairings of cars that can collide.

So the function carRaceCollision(n) will return n * n.

The time complexity of this function is O(1), which means it runs in constant time, regardless of the size of the input n.

The space complexity of this function is O(1), which means it uses a constant amount of space, regardless of the size of the input n.

So, the function carRaceCollision(n) is an efficient solution to this problem.

Here is the Java code for the function:

```java
public int carRaceCollision(int n) {
    return n * n;
}
```

This function takes an integer n as input, representing the number of cars moving in each direction. It returns the total number of collisions that can occur between the two sets of cars, which is n * n.

Here is a test case:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Solution solution = new Solution();
    System.out.println(solution.carRaceCollision(2));  // Output: 4
}
```

In this test case, there are 2 cars moving from left to right and 2 cars moving from right to left. Therefore, there are 4 possible collisions.

This function is correct and efficient, so it should pass all test cases.

Note: This problem assumes that all cars have infinite speed and are moving at the same speed.

Also, this problem is a bit simplified. In reality, there are other factors that could affect the
