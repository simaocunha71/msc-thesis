        int collisions = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                collisions += (n - j + 1);
            }
        }

        return collisions;
    }

}

This solution works by considering each car moving right to left (j) and then for each of these cars, counting the number of cars that are moving left to right (i) that collide with it. This is done by using the formula (n - j + 1) where n is the total number of cars moving left to right and j is the index of the current car moving right to left.

For example, if there are 3 cars moving left to right and 2 cars moving right to left, there will be 2 collisions (2 cars moving right to left collide with the 3 cars moving left to right).
