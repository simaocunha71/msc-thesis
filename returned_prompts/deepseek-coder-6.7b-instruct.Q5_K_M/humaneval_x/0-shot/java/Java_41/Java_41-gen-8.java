        return n * n;
    }
}

Here is the explanation:

The reason we can get the number of collisions is because each car moving left to right will collide with each car moving right to left. And since there are n cars moving in one direction and n cars moving in the other direction, that gives us n*n collisions.

In this case, we can use the formula of n*n for the number of collisions. This is because for each car moving left to right, there are n cars moving right to left that it will collide with. And vice versa.

Therefore, the total number of collisions is n*n.

This solution is efficient and works well for large n values. The time complexity is O(1) because the number of operations does not change with the size of the input, and the space complexity is O(1) because no additional space is used that scales with the size of the input.

This solution assumes that n is a non-negative integer, and that it represents the number of cars moving in each direction. If n is not a non-negative integer, or if it is not a whole number, the function may not behave as expected.

In terms of error handling, this function does not check for invalid input. It assumes that the input will always be a non-negative integer. If the input is not a non-negative integer, the function may not behave as expected.

This function could be used in a simulation of a car race to determine the number of collisions.

Test case:

Input: 3
Output: 9

Explanation: There are 3 cars moving left to right and 3 cars moving right to left. So, there will be 3 cars moving left to right that will collide with 3 cars moving right to left. Therefore, the total number of collisions is 3*3 = 9.
