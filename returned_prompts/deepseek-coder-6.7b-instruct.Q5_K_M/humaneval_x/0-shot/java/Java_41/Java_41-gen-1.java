            for(int j = 0; j < n; j++){

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2).


A: Assuming that we have n cars moving in both directions, each car will collide with every other car. So, in total, we have n cars moving to the left and n cars moving to the right. The total number of collisions would be the sum of the number of collisions for each direction.

For cars moving to the left (n of them), each car will collide with every car on the right (also n of them). So, there will be n * n = n^2 collisions for cars moving to the left.

Similarly, for cars moving to the right (n of them), each car will collide with every car on the left (n of them). So, there will be n * n = n^2 collisions for cars moving to the right.

So, in total, there will be 2 * n^2 = O(n^2) collisions.

So, the time complexity of the function is O(n^2).

This is because for each car moving to the left, we are checking with each car moving to the right. This results in a time complexity of O(n^2).

So, the function carRaceCollision has a time complexity of O(n^2).

Also, it is important to note that this is a simplification and assumes that each car is moving at the same speed and that there is no other factor causing the collisions to happen. In reality, the number of collisions may be less due to factors like the speed of the cars and their relative positions.

Edit: The time complexity of the function is O(n^2) because for each car moving to the left (n of them), we are checking with each car moving to the right (also n of them), which results in a total of n * n = n^2 operations. 

The function carRaceCollision is used to calculate the total number of collisions in a scenario where n cars are moving in opposite directions. The function simply iterates through each car moving to the left and for each
