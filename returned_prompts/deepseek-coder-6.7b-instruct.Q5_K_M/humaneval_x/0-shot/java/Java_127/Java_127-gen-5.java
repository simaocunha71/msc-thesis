Explanation:
This Java program determines whether the length of intersection of two given intervals is a prime number. The intersection of the two intervals is the interval of their intersection, i.e., the interval of all points that belong to both intervals.

The program firstly determines the start and end of the intersection by taking the maximum of the start of interval1 and interval2, and the minimum of their ends. If the start is greater than the end, then the intervals do not intersect and "NO" is returned.

The length of the intersection is then calculated by subtracting the start from the end. If the length is less than 2, it is not a prime number and "NO" is returned.

Finally, the program checks whether the length is a prime number by iterating from 2 to the square root of the length and checking if it is divisible by any of these numbers. If it is, it is not a prime number and "NO" is returned. If it is not divisible by any of these numbers, then it is a prime number and "YES" is returned.

Note: The method `Math.sqrt` is used to calculate the square root of the length, and `Math.max` and `Math.min` are used to find the start and end of the intersection.

// The time complexity is O(sqrt(n)) because in the worst case scenario, we iterate up to the square root of n times. The space complexity is O(1) because we only use
