This solution first finds the start and end points of the intersection of the two intervals. If the start is greater than the end, there is no intersection, so it returns "NO".

It then calculates the length of the intersection by subtracting the start from the end and adding 1. This correctly handles the case where the start and end are the same, which would have a length of 1.

Finally, it checks whether the length is a prime number by calling the isPrime method. If it is, it returns "YES", otherwise it returns "NO".

The isPrime method checks whether a number is prime by trying to divide it by all numbers up to its square root. If any of these divisions has a remainder of 0, the number is not prime. If none of them have a remainder of 0, the number is prime. This is an efficient way to check for prime numbers.

The time complexity of the solution is O(sqrt(n)), where n is the length of the intersection. The space complexity is O(1), as it only uses a few variables.
