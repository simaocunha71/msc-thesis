                return "NO";

Explanation:
The intersection of two intervals is calculated by taking the maximum start value and the minimum end value of the two intervals. If the start value is greater than the end value, it means the intervals do not intersect, so "NO" is returned.

The length of the intersection is calculated by subtracting the start value from the end value.

The only way the length of the intersection can be a prime number is if the intersection length is a prime number itself. We check for this by iterating from 2 to the square root of the intersection length and checking if the intersection length is divisible by any of these numbers. If it is, it means the intersection length is not a prime number, so "NO" is returned. If it is not divisible by any of these numbers, it means the intersection length is a prime number, so "YES" is returned.

Note: The square root of a number is used to reduce the number of iterations required to check if a number is prime.

This solution has a time complexity of O(sqrt(n)) and a space complexity of O(1), where n is the length of the intersection.

This is a common technique for checking if a number is prime, but there are more efficient algorithms for this, such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
