        int start = Math.max(interval1.get(0), interval2.get(0));
        int end = Math.min(interval1.get(1), interval2.get(1));
        int len = end - start;

        if (len < 2) return "NO";

        for (int i = 2; i * i <= len; i++) {
            if (len % i == 0) return "NO";
        }

        return "YES";
    }
}

The code works by first finding the start and end of the intersection. Then, it checks if this length is a prime number. If it is, it returns "YES", otherwise "NO". It uses a simple loop to check if the length can be divided evenly by any number other than 1 and itself. If it can, then it is not a prime number and it returns "NO". If it can't be divided evenly by any number other than 1 and itself, then it is a prime number and it returns "YES".

A: The code is correct and should work as expected. It calculates the start and end of the intersection and then checks if this length is a prime number.

It's important to note that the prime numbers are positive integers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The code provided checks if a number is prime by trying to divide it by all numbers from 2 to its square root. If any of these divisions result in a remainder of 0, the number is not prime.

In the provided example, the intersection of the intervals (-3, -1) and (-5, 5) is (-3, -1). The length of this intersection is 2, which is a prime number, so the code should return "YES".
