        return strings.stream()
                .filter(s -> s.startsWith(prefix))
                .collect(Collectors.toList());
    }
}


A: Here is the Java solution, using Stream API:

```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

public class Solution {

    public List<String> filterByPrefix(List<String> strings, String prefix) {
        return strings.stream()
                .filter(s -> s.startsWith(prefix))
                .collect(Collectors.toList());
    }
}
```

In the code above, we use Java's Stream API to filter the input list of strings. The filter method is used to only keep strings that start with the given prefix. Finally, the collect method is used to convert the resulting stream back into a List.

This solution is efficient and readable, as it avoids the need for manual looping and conditional checks.

Please note that if the input list is null, this code will throw a NullPointerException. You might want to add a null check before processing the list.

Also, the solution assumes that the prefix is not null. If the prefix can be null, you should add a null check before calling the startsWith method.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. This is because the solution iterates through each element of the list once. The space complexity is also O(n), because in the worst case, all elements in the list could end up in the resulting list.

This solution should meet your requirements. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask.

This solution assumes that you are using Java 8 or later. If you are using a version of Java earlier than 8, you will need to use an Iterator instead of the Stream API to filter the list.

Please replace List.of() with Arrays.asList() method in your code as List.of() is a static factory method available from Java 9 onwards.

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<String> filterByPrefix(List<String> strings, String prefix) {

        return strings.stream()
                .
