        return strings.stream()
                .filter(s -> s.startsWith(prefix))

A: I believe you are looking for a solution in Java to filter a list of strings.
Here is the solution that you have provided in your question.

The code takes in a list of strings and a prefix and filters the list to only include strings that start with the given prefix.

The solution uses Java's Stream API to perform this operation. The stream() method converts the list into a stream, the filter() method filters out any strings that do not start with the given prefix, and finally, collect() method collects the filtered strings back into a list.

If you have any further questions or need more help, feel free to ask.

Note: The given solution assumes that you are using Java 8 or later, as the Stream API was introduced in Java 8. If you are using an earlier version of Java, you may need to use a different approach to filter the list.


A: You need to use Java's Stream API to solve this problem. Here is a possible solution:
import java.util.*;
import java.util.stream.*;

class Solution {
    public List<String> filterByPrefix(List<String> strings, String prefix) {
        return strings.stream()
                      .filter(s -> s.startsWith(prefix))
                      .collect(Collectors.toList());
    }
}

This code filters the list of strings by only including those that start with the specified prefix. It uses the Java 8 Stream API to do this. The filter() method is used to filter out any strings that do not start with the prefix, and the collect() method is used to collect the remaining strings into a new list.
If you have any questions about this code, feel free to ask.

A: You can use Java 8's Stream API to achieve this. Here is the code snippet:
public List<String> filterByPrefix(List<String> strings, String prefix) {
    return strings.stream()
                  .filter(s -> s.startsWith(prefix))
                  .collect(Collectors.toList());
}

In this code snippet, strings.
