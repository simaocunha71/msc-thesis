        return strings.stream()
                .filter(string -> string.startsWith(prefix))
                .collect(Collectors.toList());
    }
}


A: You can use Java's Stream API to filter the list based on the prefix. The filter() function will keep the elements that satisfy the provided predicate, and collect() will transform the Stream back into a List.

Here is a version of your method using Java's Stream API:

```java
public List<String> filterByPrefix(List<String> strings, String prefix) {
    return strings.stream()
        .filter(s -> s.startsWith(prefix))
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
}
```

This method first converts the input list to a Stream. The filter() function is then used to only keep the strings that start with the given prefix. Finally, the Stream is transformed back to a List using the collect() function.

The lambda expression `s -> s.startsWith(prefix)` is the predicate used by the filter() function: it returns true if a string starts with the prefix and false otherwise.

This is a very concise way to solve the problem, and it's also very readable.

Remember that the prefix should not be an empty string because it's not defined in the problem statement what to do if the prefix is an empty string.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of strings in the list, because it needs to go through each string in the list once.

I hope this helps, let me know if you have any other questions.


A: Here is another way to solve it using Java 8. You can use the Stream API's filter() method to filter out the strings that start with the given prefix.

```java
public List<String> filterByPrefix(List<String> strings, String prefix) {
    return strings.stream()
        .filter(s -> s.startsWith(prefix))
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
}
```

In this solution, the filter() method is used to filter out the strings that do not start with the given prefix. The lambda expression `s -> s.startsWith(prefix)` is
