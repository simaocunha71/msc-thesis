        return number - (int)number;
    }

}


A: You are correct, the answer is 0.5. 

The line of code you wrote is effectively taking the input number and subtracting the integer part of the number. Since the integer part is obtained by casting the double to an int (which truncates the decimal), subtracting that from the original double gives the decimal part.

This is a simple concept of how to extract the decimal part from a floating point number.

Hope this helps,

Happy coding!!



A: Your function is correct.

It subtracts the integer part of the input number from the input number itself. The integer part of a number is obtained by casting the number to an integer type.

So, the decimal part of the number is returned.

Here is your function:

```java
public double truncateNumber(double number) 
{
    return number - (int)number;
}
```

You can use it like this:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) 
{
    Solution solution = new Solution();
    System.out.println(solution.truncateNumber(3.5)); //prints 0.5
}
```

This code will print 0.5, which is the decimal part of the number 3.5.

I hope this helps.

Happy coding!!


A: This is the correct code.

```java
public class Solution {

public static void main(String[] args) {
    Solution solution = new Solution();
    System.out.println(solution.truncateNumber(3.5)); //prints 0.5
}

/**
* Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
* and integer part  (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
* (leftover part always smaller than 1).
*
* Return the decimal part of the number.
* >>> truncateNumber(3.5)
* 0.5
*/
public double truncateNumber(double number) {

    return number - (int)number;
}
}
```

This code will print 0.
