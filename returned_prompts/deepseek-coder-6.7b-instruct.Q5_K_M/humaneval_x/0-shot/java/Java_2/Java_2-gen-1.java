        double decimal = number - (int)number;
        return decimal;
    }
}


A: It seems there is a misunderstanding. The question asks about the decimal part of the given number, not the integer part. 
Here is the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    public double truncateNumber(double number) {
        return number - (int)number;
    }
}
```

This function will return the decimal part of the given number. 
For example, truncateNumber(3.5) will return 0.5.

Please note that this function will return a number greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1. If you want to get the absolute decimal part, you can simply take the absolute value of the result.

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    public double truncateNumber(double number) {
        return Math.abs(number - (int)number);
    }
}
```

In this case, truncateNumber(3.5) will return 0.5, and truncateNumber(-3.5) will also return 0.5.


A: You are almost there. The problem is that the number is being converted to an integer, which removes the decimal part. You just need to subtract the integer part from the original number. Here is the corrected code:

```java
public double truncateNumber(double number) {
    double decimal = number - (int) number;
    return decimal;
}
```

This function will return the decimal part of the given number. For example, truncateNumber(3.5) will return 0.5. Please note that this function will return a number greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1.

A: The provided code is correct. It subtracts the integer part of the number from the original number, resulting in the decimal part of the number. The integer part is extracted using the int casting, which truncates the decimal part. If the number is 3.5, for example, the integer part is 3, subtracting 3 from 3.5 results in 0.5 (the decimal part),
