        return number - (int)number;
    }
}


A: 
The problem is to get the decimal part of a given number. This can be achieved by subtracting the integer part of the number from the original number. The integer part of the number can be obtained by casting the number to an integer type (int) in Java. The remaining value will be the decimal part.

Here is the correct code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution  {
    public double truncateNumber(double number) {
        return number - (int)number;
    }
}
```

Here is how this code works: 

The given number is subtracted from the number after casting it to int. This operation essentially truncates the number to its decimal part, as the integer part is removed. The result is returned as the decimal part of the original number.

For example, if the input is 3.5, the integer part is 3 and the decimal part is 0.5. When you subtract 3 from 3.5, you get 0.5, which is the decimal part of 3.5. Hence, this code will return 0.5 for input 3.5.

Please note that this code will not work as expected for negative numbers. If you want to get the decimal part of a negative number, you will need to use Math.abs() to make the number positive before subtracting the integer part.

Also, note that the result will be a double, not a float. The double type in Java is more precise than the float type.

So, the function truncateNumber(double number) will return the decimal part of the given number.
