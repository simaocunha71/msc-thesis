A: The function factorize works by iterating from 2 to n (both inclusive). For each iteration, it checks if the current number i divides n. If it does, then i is a factor of n. The function then adds i to the factors list and divides n by i (to remove i from n). This process continues until n cannot be divided by i anymore. After that, it increments i by 1 and repeats the process. This is a prime factorization algorithm.

The function returns a list of integers which are the prime factors of the input number n. The factors are returned in ascending order. The frequency of each factor in the list corresponds to the power of the factor in the prime factorization of the number.

For example, if n = 8, the function returns [2, 2, 2]. This is because 8 = 2^3. If n = 25, the function returns [5, 5]. This is because 25 = 5^2. If n = 70, the function returns [2, 5, 7]. This is because 70 = 2*5*7.

The time complexity of the function is O(n) because in the worst-case scenario, the function iterates from 2 to n (both inclusive). The space complexity of the function is also O(n) because in the worst-case scenario, all factors of n will be added to the factors list.

Note: This function assumes that the input number n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2. If n is less than 2, the function may not work correctly.

Also, note that this function uses integer division (/) to divide n by i. This is a floor division operation, which means that the result of the division is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, 5 / 2 = 2, not 2.5.

Lastly, the function uses the modulo operator (%) to check if i divides n. The modulo operation returns
