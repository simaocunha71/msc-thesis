The program is correct. It uses a simple method to factorize a number into its prime factors. It iterates from 2 to n (inclusive), and for each number, it checks if it's a divisor of n (i.e., if n is divisible by the number with no remainder). If it is, then it's a factor and it's added to the list of factors, and n is divided by the factor (to reduce n). This process continues until n is reduced to 1, at which point all of its prime factors have been found. The factors are returned as a list.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), because in the worst-case scenario (when n is a prime number), it iterates up to n times. The space complexity is also O(n), because in the worst-case scenario (when n is a prime number), it stores all of the prime factors in the list.

Note: The problem statement mentioned that the input number should be equal to the product of all factors. This requirement is not necessary for the function to work correctly, because the function is designed to factorize a given number into its prime factors. If you want to check if a given number is the product of its prime factors, you would need a different function.
