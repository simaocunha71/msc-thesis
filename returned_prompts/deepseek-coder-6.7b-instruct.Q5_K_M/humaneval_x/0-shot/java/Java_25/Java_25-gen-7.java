        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            while (n % i == 0) {
                factors.add(i);
                n /= i;

This solution uses the concept of prime factorization to find the factors of a number. It starts from 2 and keeps dividing the number by the same number until it is not divisible anymore. When it is not divisible anymore, it increments the number by 1 and continues the process until it has divided the number by all numbers from 2 to the number itself.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), and the space complexity is O(n) because we are storing the factors in a list.

Please note that this solution assumes that the input number is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2. If the input number is less than 2, the solution will return an empty list.

Also, this solution doesn't handle the case when the input number is 1. If the input number is 1, the solution will return an empty list.

If you want to handle these cases, you can add additional checks at the beginning of the function.

A: Your solution is almost correct, but it doesn't handle the case when the input number is 1. If the input number is 1, the solution will return an empty list.

Here is the correct solution:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    /**
    Return list of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.
    Each of the factors should be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appeares in factorization.
    Input number should be equal to the product of all factors
    >>> factorize(8)
    [2, 2, 2]
    >>> factorize(25)
    [5, 5]
    >>> factorize(70)
    [2, 5, 7]
      */
    public List<Integer> factorize(int n) {
        if(n <= 1) {
            return new ArrayList<>();
        }
