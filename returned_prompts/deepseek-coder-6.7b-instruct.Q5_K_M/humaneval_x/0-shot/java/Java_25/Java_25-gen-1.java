        List<Integer> factors = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            while (n % i == 0) {
                factors.add(i);
                n /= i;
            }
        }
        return factors;
    }
}


A: The question seems to be related to prime factorization. Here is the corrected code:

```
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution  {
    /**
    Return list of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.
    Each of the factors should be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appeares in factorization.
    Input number should be equal to the product of all factors
    >>> factorize(8)
    [2, 2, 2]
    >>> factorize(25)
    [5, 5]
    >>> factorize(70)
    [2, 5, 7]
      */
    public List<Integer> factorize(int n)  {
        List<Integer> factors = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            while (n % i == 0) {
                factors.add(i);
                n /= i;
            }
        }
        return factors;
    }
}
```

This code works by dividing the input number by each number starting from 2 (since 1 is not a prime number) and continuously dividing the input number by the same number until it is no longer divisible. It then increments the divisor by 1 and repeats the process until the divisor is greater than the input number. The divisors are added to the list as factors.

The time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the input number, because it checks each number up to n to see if it is a factor of the input number. The space complexity is also O(n), because it stores the factors in a list.

Please note that this code assumes that the input number is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2. If the input number is less than 2, the code would need to be adjusted to handle that case.
