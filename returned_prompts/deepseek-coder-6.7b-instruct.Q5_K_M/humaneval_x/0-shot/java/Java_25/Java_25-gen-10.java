This program uses a simple algorithm to factorize a number. It starts from 2 (the smallest prime number) and checks if it divides the number n. If it does, it adds the number to the list of factors and divides n by the number. This process is repeated until n is no longer divisible by the number. Then the number is incremented and the process is repeated until n is 1, at which point all prime factors of the original number are in the list.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), as each number up to n is potentially divided by once. The space complexity is also O(n), as in the worst case, all prime factors of n will be added to the list.

It's worth noting that this algorithm doesn't return the smallest possible list of prime factors, but rather a list of factors in ascending order.

For example, if you run the program with the input 8, the output will be [2, 2, 2], which is the prime factors of 8 in ascending order. If you run the program with the input 25, the output will be [5, 5], and if you run the program with the input 70, the output will be [2, 5, 7].

Also, the program doesn't check if the input number is a perfect square or a prime number. If you want to check for these conditions, you can add additional checks or use additional helper methods.
