public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.encrypt("hi")); // returns "lm"
        System.out.println(sol.encrypt("asdfghjkl")); // returns  "ewhjklnop"
        System.out.println(sol.encrypt("gf")); // returns "kj"
        System.out.println(sol.encrypt("et")); // returns "ix"
    }
}

This is a Java solution for the problem. The function encrypt takes a string and applies a Caesar cipher with a shift of two. The shift is multiplied by two (2*2) to achieve the desired effect. The code checks if the character is uppercase or lowercase and then applies the cipher accordingly.

The code uses the modulo operator (%) to handle the wrapping of characters around the end of the alphabet.

The main function tests the encrypt function with a few strings and prints the results.

Please note that this solution assumes the input string contains only alphabetic characters and does not handle non-alphabetic characters or special characters.

Also, this solution uses the ASCII values of the characters to perform the encryption. The ASCII values for 'a'-'z' are 97-122 and for 'A'-'Z' are 65-90.

This solution is case-sensitive and will not work correctly for strings containing uppercase and lowercase letters.

This is a simple solution and may not be suitable for all encryption needs. For more secure encryption, you should consider using a well-tested encryption algorithm.
