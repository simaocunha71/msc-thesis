        StringBuilder encryptedString = new StringBuilder();
        for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            char c = (char) ((s.charAt(i) - 'a' + 2 * 2) % 26 + 'a');
            encryptedString.append(c);
        }
        return encryptedString.toString();
    }

A: In your code, you are subtracting 'a' from the character to convert it to a number, then adding 2 to it (which effectively multiplies it by 2), and then taking the modulus by 26. 

This is not equivalent to multiplying the character by 2 and then rotating the alphabet. 

You should just add 2 to the character and then take the modulus by 26. Here is the corrected code:

```java
public String encrypt(String s) {
    StringBuilder encryptedString = new StringBuilder();
    for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
        char c = (char) ((s.charAt(i) - 'a' + 2) % 26 + 'a');
        encryptedString.append(c);
    }
    return encryptedString.toString();
}
```

This code works by subtracting 'a' from the character to convert it to a number (which is then increased by 2 and the modulus by 26 to rotate the alphabet). It then converts the number back to a character and appends it to the encrypted string. This process is repeated for each character in the input string.

For example, if the input string is "hi", the code will first convert 'h' to a number 7, add 2 to get 9, take the modulus by 26 to get 9, and convert that back to a character 'i' to get "i". The encrypted string is then "i". If the input string is "asdfghjkl", the code will convert each character in the string to a number, add 2, take the modulus by 26, and convert that back to a character to get the encrypted string.

I hope this explanation helps clarify the code.
