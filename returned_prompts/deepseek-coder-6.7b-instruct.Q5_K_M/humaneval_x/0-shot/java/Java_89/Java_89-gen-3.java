A: The function encrypt() is rotating the characters in the string s 2 places to the right. The rotation is based on the ASCII values of the characters. The function is working with both uppercase and lowercase alphabetical characters.

The character rotation is achieved with the expression (c - 'A' + 2 * 2) % 26, where 'A' is the ASCII value of the uppercase A character. This expression calculates the new position of the character after rotation.

The condition Character.isUpperCase(c) checks whether the character is an uppercase letter. If it is, the expression 'A' + (c - 'A' + 2 * 2) % 26 calculates the new ASCII value of the uppercase letter. If the character is a lowercase letter, the expression 'a' + (c - 'a' + 2 * 2) % 26 is used to calculate the new ASCII value of the lowercase letter.

Finally, the encrypted string is returned by the function.

In the example encrypt("hi") returns "lm", the 'h' is rotated 2 places to the right to become 'j', and 'i' is rotated 2 places to the right to become 'k', so "hi" becomes "jkl".

The function encrypt("asdfghjkl") returns "ewhjklnop", 'a' becomes 'c', 's' becomes 'u', 'd' becomes 'g', 'f' becomes 'j', 'g' becomes 'l', 'h' becomes 'n', 'j' becomes 'q', 'k' becomes 't', 'l' becomes 'w'.

The function encrypt("gf") returns "kj", 'g' becomes '
