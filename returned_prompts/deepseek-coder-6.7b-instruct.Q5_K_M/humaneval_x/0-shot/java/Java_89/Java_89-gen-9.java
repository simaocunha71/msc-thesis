A: The code you have is almost correct, but it's not correctly shifting the letters.  The code should be modifying the ASCII value of the characters by adding the shift factor (2 * 2), then taking the modulus 26 of the result to wrap around the alphabet.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
public String encrypt(String s) {
    StringBuilder encrypted = new StringBuilder();
    for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
        if (Character.isAlphabetic(c)) {
            int shift = 2 * 2;
            char base = Character.isUpperCase(c) ? 'A' : 'a';
            encrypted.append((char) (base + (c - base + shift) % 26));
        } else {
            encrypted.append(c);
        }
    }
    return encrypted.toString();
}
```

This version of the code works by first determining whether the character is uppercase or lowercase, and then shifting the character by the given amount. If the character is not an alphabetic character, it is appended to the result unchanged.

Note that this code assumes that the input string is in English and does not contain any special characters or numeric digits. If you need to handle these cases, you will need to modify the code accordingly.

Also, the "rotation" of the alphabet is not being done in the traditional sense of rotating the alphabet letters. Instead, the code is shifting the letters down by 2 places and then multiplying the shift by 2. This results in
