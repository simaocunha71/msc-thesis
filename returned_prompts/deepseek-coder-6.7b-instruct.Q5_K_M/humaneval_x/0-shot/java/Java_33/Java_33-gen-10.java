        List<Integer> temp = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<Integer>();

        for (int i = 0; i < l.size(); i++) {
            if (i % 3 == 0) {
                temp.add(l.get(i));
            } else {
                res.add(l.get(i));
            }
        }

        Collections.sort(temp);

        for (int i = 0; i < l.size(); i++) {
            if (i % 3 == 0) {
                res.add(i, temp.get(i / 3));
            }
        }

        return res;
    }
}

Here, I first created two lists. I added to the `temp` list the elements of the input list that are at positions that are divisible by 3 (i % 3 == 0). Then, I added to the `res` list the elements of the input list that are at positions that are not divisible by 3 (i % 3 != 0). Finally, I sorted the `temp` list and then added to the `res` list the elements of the `temp` list that are at positions that are divisible by 3, replacing the corresponding elements in the `res` list that are at positions that are not divisible by 3.

I hope this explanation is clear. If you have any further questions, don't hesitate to ask.

Also, I would like to mention that the solution provided by the user uses a more optimal approach. The user's solution is more efficient because it doesn't require two passes through the list. It first sorts the elements at indices divisible by three and then places these elements back into the original list.

Here is the user's solution:

```java
public List<Integer> sortThird(List<Integer> l) {
    List<Integer> sortList = new ArrayList<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < l.size(); i += 3) {
        sortList.add(l.get(i));
    }
    Collections.sort(sortList);
    for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < l.size(); i += 3, j
