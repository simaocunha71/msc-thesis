        List<Integer> sorted = new ArrayList<>(l);
        Collections.sort(sorted);
        for(int i = 0; i < l.size(); i++) {
            if(i % 3 == 0) {
                l.set(i, sorted.get(i));
            }
        }
        return l;
    }
}

The above code first creates a sorted copy of the input list. It then iterates through the input list. If the index of the element is divisible by 3, it sets the element at that index in the input list to the corresponding element in the sorted list.

The output of the sortThird function is the modified input list. The sorted list is not returned because the input list is modified in-place.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n), where n is the length of the input list, because it sorts the list. The space complexity is O(n), because it creates a sorted copy of the list.

This solution assumes that the input list does not contain any null elements. If the input list can contain null elements, the code should be modified to handle this case.

Please note that the problem statement is not entirely clear. It says that the elements at the indices that are divisible by three are replaced with the sorted values, but it does not specify what should happen to the elements at the indices that are not divisible by three. In the provided solution, the elements at the indices that are not divisible by three are left unchanged. If this is not the desired behavior, the code should be modified accordingly.

I hope this explanation helps. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask.


A: Here is the solution in Python:

```python
def sortThird(l):
    sorted_l = sorted(l[::3])
    for i in range(0, len(l), 3):
        l[i] = sorted_l[i//3]
    return l
```

This Python function works in the same way as the Java function you provided. The list comprehension l[::3] generates every third element from the original list. The sorted() function returns a sorted list of these elements. Then, for every third element in the original list, it is replaced with the corresponding element from the sorted list
