A: It seems like the problem you're trying to solve is not fully described. 


*

*Your function is supposed to modify the list in place (i.e., it should return the modified list itself). 

*You've defined the function signature as taking a List<Integer> as argument, but it seems like you're trying to modify it in place.

*You're returning a new list, which is not what the problem is asking for.

*Your function is supposed to sort the values at the indices that are divisible by 3, not the other way around.


Given these points, here is the corrected code:
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    public List<Integer> sortThird(List<Integer> l) {
        List<Integer> temp = new ArrayList<>();

        for(int i = 0; i < l.size(); i++) {
            if(i % 3 == 0) {
                temp.add(l.get(i));
            }
        }

        Collections.sort(temp);

        for(int i = 0, j = 0; i < l.size(); i++) {
            if(i % 3 == 0) {
                l.set(i, temp.get(j++));
            }
        }

        return l;
    }
}

This code sorts the values at the indices that are divisible by 3, and leaves the values at the other indices in their original order. If you want
