        List<Integer> newList = new ArrayList<>(l);
        List<Integer> tempList = new ArrayList<>();

        for(int i=0; i < l.size(); i++){
            if(i % 3 == 0){
                tempList.add(l.get(i));
            }
        }

        Collections.sort(tempList);

        int j = 0;
        for(int i=0; i < l.size(); i++){
            if(i % 3 == 0){
                newList.set(i, tempList.get(j));
                j++;
            }
        }

        return newList;
    }
}

This solution works by first creating a copy of the original list, then creating a new list that contains the elements at the indices divisible by 3. This new list is sorted and then the sorted values are set back into the original list at the indices divisible by 3.

It is important to note that this solution assumes that the list passed in is not null and has at least one element. If this is not the case, the behavior of the program may be unpredictable.

This solution also has a time complexity of O(n log n) because of the sorting operation, and a space complexity of O(n) because of the additional list created to hold the elements at the indices divisible by 3.

The function returns a new list that is identical to the original list in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal to the values of the corresponding indicies of the original list, but sorted.

**Explanation:**

This problem is about manipulating a list based on certain conditions. The main condition is that we need to sort the values at the indices divisible by 3. This can be done by first creating a copy of the original list, then creating a new list that contains the elements at the indices divisible by 3. This new list is sorted and then the sorted values are set back into the original list at the indices divisible by 3.

The solution uses Java programming language and it is based on the concept of list, loops and conditional statements.
