        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>(l);
        List<Integer> temp = new ArrayList<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < l.size(); i++) {
            if (i % 3 == 0) {
                temp.add(l.get(i));
            }
        }

        Collections.sort(temp);

        for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < l.size(); i++) {
            if (i % 3 == 0) {
                result.set(i, temp.get(j++));
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
}

The above code works by first copying the input list into a new list. Then, it creates a temporary list to store the elements at indices divisible by 3. After sorting this temporary list, it replaces the elements of the new list at the indices divisible by 3 with the elements of the sorted temporary list.

This code assumes that the input list contains at least one element. If the input list can be empty, you should add a check for this case before the for-loop in the function.

Also, this code assumes that the elements of the input list are integers. If the elements are not integers, you should replace the Integer type in the function signature and in the code with the appropriate type.

In addition, the function name might be a bit misleading. The term "sortThird" suggests that the function sorts the elements at the third index, but it actually sorts the elements at the indices that are divisible by 3.

Finally, the code uses the modulo operator (%) to determine if the index is divisible by 3. This operator returns the remainder of the division of the index by 3. If the remainder is 0, the index is divisible by 3.

The time complexity of this code is O(n log n), where n is the size of the input list. This is because it uses the sort function, which has a time complexity of O(n log n). The space complexity is O(n), because it creates a new list to store the elements of the input list.

Overall, this code is a good solution to the problem.
