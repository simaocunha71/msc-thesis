        List<Integer> count = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        count.add(0);
        count.add(0);
        
        num = Math.abs(num);
        
        while(num > 0){
            int digit = num % 10;
            if(digit % 2 == 0){
                count.set(0, count.get(0) + 1);
            }else{
                count.set(1, count.get(1) + 1);

The above solution is correct and it counts the number of even and odd digits in the given integer. 

Here, I have used a while loop to go through each digit of the given integer. 

I have used the modulo operator (%) to get the last digit of the integer and then checked if it is even or odd by checking if the remainder is 0. 

If it is even, I have incremented the count of even digits by 1, and if it is odd, I have incremented the count of odd digits by 1. 

Finally, I have returned the list containing the counts of even and odd digits.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of digits in the given integer. 

The space complexity of this solution is O(1), because I have used a constant amount of space to store the counts of even and odd digits.
