A: The question seems to be about programming and asking for a solution in Java. If you need an explanation, I will be glad to provide it.

Here's how you can solve this:

Firstly, you need to import the necessary libraries. For this problem, you'll need java.util.List.

Then, you need to create a method that takes a List of Doubles as an argument. Inside this method, you will initialize a variable to hold the sum of the squares of the numbers in the list.

In the for-each loop, you will go through each number in the list. For each number, you will round it up to the nearest integer using the Math.ceil() method. Then, you will square this rounded number and add it to the sum.

Finally, you return the sum.

Here's the solution:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int sumSquares(List<Double> lst) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (double num : lst) {
            sum += Math.ceil(num) * Math.ceil(num);
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

In this code, the Math.ceil() method rounds a number up to the nearest integer. The sum of the squares of the numbers in the list is calculated and stored in the sum variable. This sum is then returned.

Please note that this solution assumes that the input list will not be null and will contain only valid numbers.

If you need any further clarification, please let me know.


A: The given code is a Java solution to the problem statement. It will round each element of the given list to the nearest integer and then square it before adding it to the sum. The final sum is then returned.

Here is how it works:

1. First, it initializes a variable `sum` to 0. This will store the sum of the squares of the elements in the list.

2. Then, it goes through each element `num` in the list `lst
