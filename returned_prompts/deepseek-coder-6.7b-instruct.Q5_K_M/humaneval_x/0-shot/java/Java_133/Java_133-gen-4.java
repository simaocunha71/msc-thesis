        int sum = 0;
        for (double num : lst) {
            sum += Math.pow(Math.ceil(num), 2);
        }
        return sum;
    }
}


A: You can solve this problem by iterating over the given list, rounding each element to the upper int using Math.ceil(), and then squaring and adding it to the sum.

Here is a Java solution:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    public int sumSquares(List<Double> lst) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (double num : lst) {
            sum += Math.pow(Math.ceil(num), 2);
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

This solution works by first initializing a variable `sum` to 0. It then loops over each number in `lst`, rounding it to the nearest integer using `Math.ceil()`, squaring it using `Math.pow()`, and adding the result to `sum`. Finally, it returns `sum`.

For example, if `lst` is `[1.4, 4.2, 0]`, the rounded numbers would be `[2, 4, 0]`, the squared rounded numbers would be `[4, 16, 0]`, and `sum` would be `20`, so the function would return `20`.

If `lst` is `[-2.4, 1, 1]`, the rounded numbers would be `[-2, 1, 1]`, the squared rounded numbers would be `[4, 1, 1]`, and `sum` would be `6`, so the function would return `6`.

This solution assumes that the input list `lst` is not empty. If `lst` could be empty, you should add a check for this at the beginning of the function.

Also, note that this solution uses `double` for the type of the elements in `lst`, which means it can handle fractional numbers. If you only want to handle integer numbers, you should change the type of `lst
