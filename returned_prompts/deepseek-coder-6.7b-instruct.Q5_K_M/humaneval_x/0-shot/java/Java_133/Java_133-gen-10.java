        int sum = 0;
        for(Double num : lst){
            sum += Math.ceil(num) * Math.ceil(num);
        }
        return sum;
    }
}


A: The question is asking to round each number to the nearest integer, and then square it. 

So for the list [1.4, 4.2, 0], the numbers after rounding are [2, 4, 0]. After squaring these, you get [4, 16, 0]. The sum of these squares is 20. 

Here is the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    public int sumSquares(List<Double> lst) {
        int sum = 0;
        for(Double num : lst){
            int roundedNum = (int)Math.ceil(num);
            sum += roundedNum * roundedNum;
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

This code works by first rounding each number in the list to the nearest integer using Math.ceil(). After that, it squares each rounded number and adds the squared numbers to the sum. Finally, it returns the sum.

The corrected code should produce the correct output for the given examples.
