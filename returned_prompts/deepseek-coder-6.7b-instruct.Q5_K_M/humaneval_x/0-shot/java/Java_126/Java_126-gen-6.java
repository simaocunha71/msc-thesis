        int counter = 0;

B:
        for (int i = 0; i < lst.size() - 1; i++) {
            if (lst.get(i) < lst.get(i + 1)) {
                counter++;
            }
        }

C:
        if (counter == lst.size() - 1) {
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }

    }
}

This code checks whether the given list is sorted in ascending order. If it is, the function returns true, otherwise it returns false.

The code works by iterating through each number in the list and comparing it with the next one. If the current number is less than the next one, it increases a counter. At the end of the loop, if the counter is equal to the size of the list minus 1 (which represents the number of pairs that are in ascending order), the list is sorted and the function returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

The function can handle lists with duplicate numbers because it doesn't care about the actual numbers but only about their relative order. If a number is less than the next one, the counter will be increased, even if the numbers are the same. If the counter is equal to the size of the list minus 1, it means that all the numbers are in ascending order and the function returns true, even if there are duplicate numbers.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the size of the list. This is because it needs to iterate through the list once. The space complexity is O(1), because it uses a constant amount of space to store the counter and the indices.

The function will return true for an empty list and a list with only one element, because these lists are already sorted.

Note: This function assumes that the list contains only positive integers. If the list can contain negative numbers or zero, the function needs to be modified to handle these cases.

This function can be used to check if a list is sorted in ascending order in a sorted list of positive integers.
