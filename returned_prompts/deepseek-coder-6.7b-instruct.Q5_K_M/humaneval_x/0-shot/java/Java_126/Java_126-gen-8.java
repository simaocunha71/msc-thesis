        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < lst.size() - 1; i++) {
            if (lst.get(i) < lst.get(i + 1)) {
                count++;
            } else if (lst.get(i) == lst.get(i + 1)) {
                return false;
            }
        }

B:
        if (count == lst.size() - 1) {
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }

C:
        return count == lst.size() - 1 ? true : false;
    }
}

How does the function work?
The function uses a loop to iterate through the list and check if each element is less than the next one. If it is, the counter is incremented. If not, the function returns false. 

If the counter equals the size of the list minus 1 (because there are n-1 pairs to compare), the function returns true, indicating that the list is sorted in ascending order.

If there are duplicates in the list, the function will return false. 

The function works for lists of any size, and it assumes that no negative numbers and only integers are in the list.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the size of the list, because it needs to iterate through the entire list once.

The space complexity of this function is O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the counter and the list elements.

Is the function correct?
Yes, the function is correct. It correctly identifies sorted lists and returns false for lists that are not sorted, including those with duplicates. It also handles edge cases like lists of size 1 correctly.

Is the function efficient?
Yes, the function is efficient. It iterates through the list only once, so its time complexity is O(n), where n is the size of the list. It uses a constant amount of space, so its space complexity is O(1).

Is the function robust?
Yes, the function is robust. It handles edge cases like lists of size 1 and it correctly identifies sorted lists. It also handles cases where the list contains duplicates by returning
