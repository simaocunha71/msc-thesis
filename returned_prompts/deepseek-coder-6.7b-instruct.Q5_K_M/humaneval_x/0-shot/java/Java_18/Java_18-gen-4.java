        int count = 0;
        int i = 0;

        while (true) {
            i = string.indexOf(substring, i);
            if (i != -1) {
                count ++;
                i += substring.length();
            } else {
                break;

        return count;
    }
}

I understand that this is a solution for finding the number of occurrences of a substring in a larger string, and that it will overlap if the substring appears in the larger string multiple times. However, I'm not sure why this would return 0 for the first test case.
The first test case seems to indicate that the substring is not present in the string, yet the function returns 0, which doesn't make sense to me. 
Could someone explain why this function returns 0 for the first test case?

A: The function is not returning 0 because you are not considering the case where the input substring is an empty string. When you pass an empty string as a substring to indexOf, it always returns 0, and the loop continues indefinitely.

A: Your function will return 0 if the substring is an empty string, because the indexOf method with an empty string will always return 0. So it will never enter the while loop.
Here is the explanation:


*

*If the substring is empty, the indexOf method will always return 0, because you are looking for an empty string at the start of your main string.

*But, if you pass an empty string to indexOf, it will always return 0, because you are looking for an empty string at the start of your main string.

*So, the while loop will never start because indexOf will always return 0.

*So, the function will return 0, because you never increment the count.


If you want to handle the case where the substring is an empty string, you could add a special case for it:
public int howManyTimes(String string, String substring) {
    int count = 0;
    int i = 0;

    if (substring.isEmpty()) {
        return 1; // since every string contains at least an empty substring
    }

    while
