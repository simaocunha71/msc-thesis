        int count = 0;
        int index = 0;

        while (true) {
            index = string.indexOf(substring, index);
            if (index != -1) {
                count ++;
                index += substring.length();
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
}

The logic of this solution is to use the indexOf method of String class which returns the index within the string of the first occurrence of the specified substring. If the substring is not found, it returns -1. We then increment the count and move the index forward by the length of the substring to consider overlapping cases. The loop continues until indexOf method returns -1.

We then return the count which is the number of times the substring occurs in the string.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because we are performing a constant amount of work for each character in the string.

A: Your code is correct and should work as expected for all of the test cases you provided.
