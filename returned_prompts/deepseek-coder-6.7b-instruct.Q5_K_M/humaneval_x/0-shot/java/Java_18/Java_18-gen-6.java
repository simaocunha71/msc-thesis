## Explanation
The `howManyTimes` function takes in a string and a substring as input and returns the number of times the substring appears in the string. The function uses the `indexOf` method of the string to find the first occurrence of the substring in the string. If the substring is found, the index is updated to the next character after the found substring and the count is incremented by 1. This process repeats until the substring is no longer found in the string. The function finally returns the count.

## Test cases
The test cases cover different scenarios:

- Empty substring: If the substring is empty, the function returns 0 as no substring can be found in the string.
- Substring present once: If the substring is present once in the string, the function returns 1.
- Substring present multiple times: If the substring is present multiple times in the string, the function returns the correct count.
- Substring overlaps: If the substring overlaps with itself in the string, the function correctly counts the overlapping occurrences.

## Time complexity
The time complexity of the `howManyTimes` function is O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because the function makes a single pass through the string using the `indexOf` method, which has a time complexity of O(n).

## Space complexity
The space complexity of the `howManyTimes` function is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the count and the index. This does not include the space used by the input strings, which can be up to the length of the string.

## Note
The `indexOf` method used in this function starts searching from the index provided, which makes it suitable for counting overlapping occurrences.
