public class Main {

        System.out.println(sol.howManyTimes("aaa", "a")); // 3

A: 
Here is the solution to the problem. The method howManyTimes finds the substring in the original string and counts the number of occurrences.

public int howManyTimes(String string, String substring) 
{
    int count = 0;
    int index = 0;

    while (true)
    {
        index = string.indexOf(substring, index);
        if (index != -1)
        {
            count ++;
            index += substring.length();
        }
        else
        {
            break;
        }
    }

    return count;
}

This code works by using the indexOf method from the String class in Java. The indexOf method returns the index within this string of the first occurrence of the specified substring. If the substring occurs at index n, the index of the next occurrence of the substring is n+substring.length().

In the while loop, the index of the substring is updated in each iteration. If the index is not -1, it means the substring was found in the string, so the count is incremented by 1. If the index is -1, it means the substring was not found, so the loop breaks.

Finally, the method returns the count of occurrences of the substring in the string.

Note: The while loop breaks when the index is -1, indicating that the substring was not found in the
