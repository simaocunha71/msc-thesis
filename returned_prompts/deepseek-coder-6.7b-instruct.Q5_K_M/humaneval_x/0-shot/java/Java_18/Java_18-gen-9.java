A: 
What is the time complexity of the provided solution?

The time complexity of the provided solution is O(n*m), where n is the length of the string and m is the length of the substring. This is because the solution uses the indexOf method of the String class which is O(n), and it calls it in a loop until it cannot find the substring any longer in the string. This results in a worst-case scenario of n iterations, each iteration performing a O(n) operation.

What is the space complexity of the provided solution?

The space complexity of the provided solution is O(1), which means it uses constant space. This is because it only uses a small amount of extra space (for the count and index variables), regardless of the size of the input.

Is there a more efficient solution?

Yes, the provided solution is already quite efficient. However, if the length of the string is very large and we only need to know whether the substring exists or not (not the number of times it occurs), we could use the contains method of the String class, which has a time complexity of O(n):

```java
public boolean containsSubstring(String string, String substring) {
    return string.contains(substring);
}
```

This solution would be more efficient if we only need to know if the substring exists, rather than how many times it occurs.

Please note that the complexity of these solutions may vary depending on the specific implementation of the String class in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

I tried to understand the logic of the solution and I got it. Now, I am trying to understand the time complexity and space complexity of this solution.

Great, you've done a good job at explaining your understanding of the solution. Now, I just need to understand the time and space complexity of the solution.

I appreciate your help.
