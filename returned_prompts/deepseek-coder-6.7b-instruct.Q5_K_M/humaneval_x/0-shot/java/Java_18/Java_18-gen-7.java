A: In your code, you are using the indexOf method of the String class in a while loop to find the occurrence of the substring in the original string. The indexOf method returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified substring in this string, or -1 if no such substring exists.

In your code, you are updating the index to be the next index after the found substring. This is how you are handling overlapping cases. If you don't update the index, you will end up in an infinite loop as you will keep finding the substring at the same index.

Your code is correct in handling overlapping cases. It will count overlapping occurrences of the substring in the original string.

I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any further questions.

A: Here is the Java code which counts overlapping occurrences of a substring in a given string.
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(howManyTimes("", "a")); // 0
        System.out.println(howManyTimes("aaa", "a")); // 3
        System.out.println(howManyTimes("aaaa", "aa")); // 3
    }

    public static int howManyTimes(String string, String substring) {
        int count = 0;
        int index = 0;

        while (index < string.length()) {
            index =
