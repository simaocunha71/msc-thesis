        if(x>y)
            return -1;
        if(x%2==1)
            x++;
        if(y%2==1)
            y--;
        if(x>y)
            return -1;
        return y;
    }
}

Here, we first check if the range is valid, if not then return -1. If x is odd, we increment x by 1 to make it even. If y is odd, we decrement y by 1 to make it even. After these modifications, if x is still greater than y, that means there is no even number in the range, so we return -1. Finally, we return y, which is the largest even number in the range.

In the problem statement, it was mentioned that "the biggest even integer number that is in the range [x, y] inclusive". So, we return y as it is the biggest even number in the range.

The time complexity of this solution is O(1) as it does not depend on the size of the input. The space complexity is O(1) as it uses a constant amount of space.

The function chooseNum takes two integer parameters and returns an integer.
