A: Here is a simple way to solve the problem:

The problem can be divided into two sub-problems:

1. Determine the biggest even number in the range [x, y].
2. Check if there exists any even number in the range [x, y].

We can solve the first sub-problem by taking the floor of the average of x and y. The floor of the average is the biggest even number that is less than or equal to the average. If this number is even, then it is the biggest even number in the range [x, y].

To solve the second sub-problem, we can simply check if the biggest even number in the range [x, y] is greater than x.

Finally, we can return the biggest even number in the range [x, y] if it exists, otherwise return -1.

Here is the Java code that implements this solution:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    public int chooseNum(int x, int y) {
        int avg = (x + y) / 2;
        int result = avg / 2 * 2; // The biggest even number that is less than or equal to the average
        return (result <= y && result >= x) ? result : -1;
    }
}
```

This code works by first calculating the average of x and y. It then calculates the biggest even number that is less than or equal to the average by taking the floor of the average. If this number is in the range [x, y], it is returned. Otherwise, -1 is returned.

This solution has a time complexity of O(1)
