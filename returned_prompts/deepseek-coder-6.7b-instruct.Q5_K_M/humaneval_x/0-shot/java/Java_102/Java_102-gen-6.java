        for (int i = y; i >= x; i--) {
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}


A: The function works correctly. It iterates from the upper bound y to the lower bound x (inclusive), and for each number, it checks if the number is even (i % 2 == 0). If it is, it returns the number. If no even number is found during this process, it returns -1 as required.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the difference between y and x. This is because in the worst case, the function has to check each number in the range from x to y.

The space complexity is O(1), which means the space required by the function does not change with the size of the input. This is because the function uses only a small amount of additional space to store the variables and does not use any data structures that grow with the input size.

The function is correct and efficient.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution  {
    public int chooseNum(int x, int y) {
        for (int i = y; i >= x; i--) {
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```

Hope this helps you.
