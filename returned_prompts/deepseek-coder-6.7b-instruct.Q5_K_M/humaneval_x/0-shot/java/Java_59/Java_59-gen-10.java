A: The problem asks you to return the largest prime factor of a number. Here is a step by step explanation of the solution:

-First, we divide the number by 2 until the number becomes odd. This is because every even number can be divided by 2. The largest prime factor of an even number will always be 2.

-Then we start from 3 and go up to the square root of the number. We increment by 2 in each step because we know that the number is not divisible by even numbers.

-If the number is still greater than 2 after this process, it means that the number is a prime number and we assign it as the largest prime factor.

-Finally, we return the largest prime factor.

This algorithm works because of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, which states that every integer greater than 1 is either a prime number or can be represented as a product of prime numbers. By dividing the number by the smallest prime number (2) first, we can reduce the size of the number and make the algorithm faster.

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(sqrt(n)), because in the worst case, we iterate up to the square root of the number. The space complexity is O(1), because we only use a constant amount of space to store the largest prime factor and the number.

This solution assumes that the input number is always greater than 1 and is not a prime number. If the input number is a prime number, the function will return the number itself as the largest
