    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < q.size(); i++) {
        sum += q.get(i);

    if(sum > w) {
        return false;

    Collections.reverse(q);
    return q.equals(q);

This solution seems to be correct, but the problem is that it doesn't work properly for the case where the list is not palindromic. The palindromic check is not implemented correctly.

A: In your code, you are checking if the list is palindromic by reversing it and then checking if it's equal to the original list. This will not work because you are reversing the list in place, which will affect the original list. 

Instead, you should create another list and append the elements of the original list in reverse order to it. Then, you can check if the two lists are equal.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
public boolean willItFly(List<Integer> q, int w) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < q.size(); i++) {
        sum += q.get(i);
    }

    if(sum > w) {
        return false;
    }
    
    List<Integer> reversedList = new ArrayList<>();
    for (int i = q.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        reversedList.add(q.get(i));
    }

    return q.equals(reversedList);
}
```

This code will return true if the list is palindromic and its sum is less than or equal to w, and false otherwise.

Also, you should make sure that you are using a more appropriate data structure for this problem. Instead of using a `List`, consider using an `Array` or a `Queue`, if the order of the elements matters. If it doesn't matter, consider using a `Set` or `Map`.

The choice of data structure will depend on the specific requirements of your problem. For example, if you need to check if a number is in the list, a Set would be
