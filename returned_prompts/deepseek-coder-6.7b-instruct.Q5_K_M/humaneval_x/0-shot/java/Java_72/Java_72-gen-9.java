        int sum = 0;
        int size = q.size();
        for(int i = 0; i<size; i++){
            sum += q.get(i);
        }

        if(sum > w){
            return false;
        }

        Collections.reverse(q);

        return q.equals(q);
    }
}

The problem with the above code is that it's not properly checking if the list is a palindrome. It's checking if the list equals its reverse. This would return true for lists that are palindromes when they are not, because the reverse of a palindrome is the same as the original. To fix this, you would need to write a loop to compare each element of the list with its corresponding element from the end of the list.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
public boolean willItFly(List<Integer> q, int w) {
    int sum = 0;
    int size = q.size();
    for(int i = 0; i<size; i++){
        sum += q.get(i);
    }

    if(sum > w){
        return false;
    }

    for(int i = 0; i < size / 2; i++){
        if(!q.get(i).equals(q.get(size - i - 1))){
            return false;
        }
    }

    return true;
}
```
This code will correctly check if the list is a palindrome and return true only if it is.

Please, try to solve this problem by yourself. It's a good practice to solve coding problems step by step.
