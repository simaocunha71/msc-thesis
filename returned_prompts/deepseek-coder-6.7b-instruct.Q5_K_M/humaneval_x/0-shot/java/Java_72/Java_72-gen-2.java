A: Here's the solution for you.
You need to check two conditions. The first one is to check if the sum of all elements in the list is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight w. The second condition is to check if the list is balanced i.e., each element at a position from start is equal to the element at the corresponding position from end. 


*

*First, calculate the sum of all elements in the list. If it's greater than w, return false.

*Then, initialize two variables, start and end, to 0 and q.size()-1 respectively.

*Run a while loop until start is less than end. In each iteration, check if the elements at start and end are not equal. If they are not equal, return false. If they are equal, increment start and decrement end.

*If the while loop completes without returning false, it means the list is balanced and the sum of its elements is less than or equal to w. So, return true.


This solution assumes that the list is not empty and the maximum possible weight is positive. If these assumptions are not valid, you need to add corresponding checks.

A: Your code is correct and efficient. But there is a minor mistake in the while loop condition. You are comparing start with end. But, in a palindrome, the elements at the start and end are equal. So, you should compare start with end+1. 

Here is the corrected code:

```java
public boolean willItFly(List<Integer> q, int w)  {
    int sum = 0;
    for(int i : q) {
        sum += i;
    }
    if(sum > w) {
        return false;
    }
