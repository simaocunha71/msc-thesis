        double fx;

            fx = poly(xs, x);
            if (fx < 0) {
                x += 0.1;
            } else if (fx > 0) {
                x -= 0.1;

A: In the findZero method, you are continuously adjusting the value of x by 0.1 units, which may not be sufficient to find the exact zero of the function. This can lead to a long running time or even not finding the zero at all.

You can use a more sophisticated method to find the root of the function. For instance, you can use the Bisection Method, which is a root-finding method that applies to any continuous functions for which one knows two values with opposite signs. The Bisection Method is simple to understand and implement, but it is not as efficient as other methods.

Here is the Bisection Method implementation in Java:

```java
public double findZero(List<Double> xs) {
    double a = -10;
    double b = 10;
    double c = 0;

    while ((b - a) >= 0.01) {
        c = (a + b) / 2;
        if (poly(xs, c) == 0.0) {
            break;
        } else if (poly(xs, c) * poly(xs, a) < 0) {
            b = c;
        } else {
            a = c;
        }
    }
    return c;
}
```
This method starts with two initial guesses a and b such that f(a) and f(b) have opposite signs. It then iteratively refines the guess by taking the average of a and b until the difference between a and b is less than or equal to a small threshold (0.01 in this case). The final guess c is the root of the function.

Please note that this method only works if the initial guesses a and b are such that f(a) and f(b) have opposite signs. If this is not the case, the method may not conver
