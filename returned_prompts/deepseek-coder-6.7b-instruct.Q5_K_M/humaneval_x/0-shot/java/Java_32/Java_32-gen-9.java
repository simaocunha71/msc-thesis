I'm having trouble with part A of the solution. The while loop condition seems to be causing a problem as it will keep running indefinitely. I'm not sure how to fix it. Any help would be appreciated.

A: The problem seems to be with the while loop condition. In the current condition, the loop will keep running indefinitely if the function is not strictly monotonous in the interval [left, right]. 

A: The problem lies in the first while loop. If the function's value at the left and right points are of the same sign, it means that the function has zeros in the interval (left, right), which contradicts the fact that the function is strictly decreasing.

The while loop should be modified so that it stops when the function's value at the left and right points are of different sign. This will ensure that the interval [left, right] contains a zero of the function.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
while (poly(xs, left) * poly(xs, right) >= 0) {
    if (Math.abs(poly(xs, left)) < Math.abs(poly(xs, right))) {
        left -= 0.1;
    } else {
        right += 0.1;
    }
}
```

This code will first find two points (left and right) such that the function changes its sign in the interval (left, right). Then, it will perform a binary search in
