The provided solution is correct and the explanation is clear. However, it seems to be missing a few details.

The function `poly` is correctly implemented. It iterates over the list of coefficients `xs`, and for each coefficient, it multiplies it by `x` raised to the power of the current index `i`. The result is then added to the `result` variable.

The function `findZero` uses the bisection method to find the root of the polynomial. It starts with a range `[-200, 200]` and div
