            } else if (poly(xs, start) * poly(xs, mid) < 0) {
                end = mid;
            } else {

I'm not sure why your code wouldn't work as expected. However, I can tell you that the function `poly(xs, x)` is correct. It calculates the polynomial value at point x with coefficients xs.

The function `findZero(xs)` uses the Bisection method to find a root of a polynomial. It starts by setting `start` to -10 and `end` to 10, then it calculates the mid point, and checks if the polynomial value at `mid` is zero. If it is, it returns `mid`. If not, it checks if the product of the polynomial values at `start` and `mid` is negative. If it is, it means the root is in the interval from `start` to `mid`, so it sets `end` to `mid`. Otherwise, it means the root is in the interval from `mid` to `end`, so it sets `start` to `mid`. This process repeats until the absolute value of the difference between `start` and `end` is less than a small number (e.g., 1e-6).

Here's the corrected version of your code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    public double poly(List<Double> xs, double x) {
        double result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < xs.size(); i++) {
            result += xs.get(i) * Math.pow(x, i);
        }
        return result;
    }

    public double findZero(List<Double> xs) {
        double result = 0;
        double start = -10;
        double end =
