Here is the code for finding the roots of a polynomial using the bisection method. The bisection method is a root-finding method that applies to any continuous functions for which one knows two values with opposite signs.

The while loop continues until the value of the function at the midpoint (c) is close to zero. If the function at the midpoint is positive, the root lies in the interval [a, c]; otherwise, it lies in the interval [c, b]. The bisection method is guaranteed to converge if the function is continuous and has at least one root in the interval [a, b].

In this code, the function poly(xs, x) calculates the value of the polynomial at a given point x. The function findZero(xs) finds a root of the polynomial using the bisection method. The interval [a, b] is initially set to [0, 1]. The midpoint c of the interval is calculated in each iteration and is checked whether the function at the midpoint is positive or negative. Depending on the result, the interval [a, c] or [c, b] is chosen for the next iteration. The loop continues until the value of the function at the midpoint is close to zero.

The time complexity of this code is O(log(b - a)) where b - a is the length of the interval [a, b]. This is because in each iteration the length of the interval is halved, so the number of iterations required to reach a root is logarithmic to the base 2.

This code assumes that the input list xs has even size and that the largest absolute value in xs is less than 1. If these assumptions are not met, the code may not work as expected.
