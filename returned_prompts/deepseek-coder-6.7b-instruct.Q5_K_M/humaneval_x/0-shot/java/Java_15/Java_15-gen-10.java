        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

        for(int i=0; i<=n; i++){
            sb.append(i);
            if(i<n)
                sb.append(" ");
        }

        return sb.toString();
    }
}


A: The problem with the code is that it is appending the number itself without checking whether it is the last number in the sequence. If it is not the last number, it appends a space after it. This is causing the extra space after the last number.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution  {
    /**
    Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.
    >>> stringSequence(0)
    "0"
    >>> stringSequence(5)
    "0 1 2 3 4 5"
     */
    public String stringSequence(int n)  {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

        for(int i=0; i<=n; i++){
            sb.append(i);
            if(i<n) // if it is not the last number in the sequence, append a space
                sb.append(" ");
        }

        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```

This code will now give the correct output.

For n=0, it will return "0".
For n=5, it will return "0 1 2 3 4 5".

So the problem is resolved.

Note: The problem statement is a bit confusing. If the problem statement is to return a string with numbers separated by a space, then there is no need to add a space after the last number. So, for n=5, it should return "0 1 2 3 4 5" and not "0 1 2 3 4 5 ".

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution  {
    /**
    Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.
    >>> stringSequence(0)
    "0"
    >>> string
