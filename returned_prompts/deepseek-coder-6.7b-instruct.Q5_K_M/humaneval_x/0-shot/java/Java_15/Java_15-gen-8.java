        StringBuilder sequence = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            sequence.append(i).append(" ");
        }
        return sequence.toString().trim();
    }
}

The provided solution is correct as it generates a string sequence of numbers starting from 0 to n, inclusive. The sequence is constructed by iterating from 0 to n and appending each number and a space to the StringBuilder. The trim method is then used to remove the trailing space.

Here is a Java program that uses this solution:

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println(solution.stringSequence(n));
    }
}

In this program, the user is asked to enter a number. The number is passed to the stringSequence method of the Solution class. The result is printed to the console.

For example, if the user enters 5, the program will print: "0 1 2 3 4 5".
