                sb.append(" ");

A: I'm sorry, but your answer is not correct. 

The correct answer should be:

```java
public String stringSequence(int n) {
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        sb.append(i);
        if (i < n) {
            sb.append(" ");
        }
    }

    return sb.toString();
}
```

The problem was that you did not add the space after the number. The append method in StringBuilder does not add a space automatically. You need to add it manually if you want spaces to be added between the numbers.

This will return a string sequence of numbers from 0 to n, separated by spaces.

For example, if you call stringSequence(5), the returned string will be "0 1 2 3 4 5".

The time complexity of this function is O(n), as it iterates from 0 to n. The space complexity is also O(n), as it constructs a new string of length n.

I hope this helps, and let me know if you have any other questions.

A: You're correct, my apologies for the misunderstanding. The appended space was unnecessary. Here is the corrected code:

```java
public String stringSequence(int n) {
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        sb.append(i);
        if (i < n) {
            sb.append(" ");
        }
    }

    return sb.toString();
}
```

This code will return a string of numbers from 0 to n, separated by spaces. For example, if you call stringSequence(5), it will return "0 1 2 3 4 5".
