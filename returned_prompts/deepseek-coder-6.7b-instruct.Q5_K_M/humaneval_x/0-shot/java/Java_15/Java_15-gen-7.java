        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

        for(int i = 0; i <= n; i++){
            sb.append(i);

                sb.append(" ");

A: You can use a StringBuilder to append all the numbers to the string. You can start a loop from 0 to n inclusive and in each iteration, append the current number and a space to the StringBuilder. If the current number is n, don't append a space after it. At the end of the loop, convert the StringBuilder to a string and return it.

A: Here is the code for the problem you have posted.

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    /**
    Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.
    >>> stringSequence(0)
    "0"
    >>> stringSequence(5)
    "0 1 2 3 4 5"
      */
    public String stringSequence(int n) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for(int i = 0; i <= n; i++){
            sb.append(i);
            if(i < n){
                sb.append(" ");
            }
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```

This code defines a class Solution with a method stringSequence. This method takes an integer n as parameter and returns a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.

The solution uses a StringBuilder to build the string. The for loop runs from 0 to n (inclusive), and for each iteration, it appends the current number and a space to the StringBuilder. If the current number is n, it doesn't append a space after it. Finally, it converts the StringBuilder to a string and returns it.

You can test the method with the following code:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        System.out.println(solution.stringSequence(0)); // "
