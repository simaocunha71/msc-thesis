        int max = l.get(0);

        for(int i = 1; i < l.size(); i++) {
            if(l.get(i) > max) {
                max = l.get(i);
            }
        }

        return max;
    }
}

This solution works by initializing the `max` variable to the first element in the list. Then it iterates through the rest of the list. If it finds an element that is greater than `max`, it updates `max` to that element. After going through all the elements, `max` will be the maximum element in the list.

I hope this helps clarify the solution to the problem. Let me know if you have any other questions.
