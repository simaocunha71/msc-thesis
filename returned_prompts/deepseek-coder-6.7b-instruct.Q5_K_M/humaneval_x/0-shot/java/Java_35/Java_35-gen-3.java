        int max = l.get(0);
        for(int i=1; i<l.size(); i++){
            if(l.get(i) > max){
                max = l.get(i);
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
}

The code is checking each element of the list one by one and if the current element is bigger than the current maximum, it sets that as the new maximum.
The time complexity of this solution is O(n) where n is the size of the list. This is because we need to check every element in the list once to ensure we have found the maximum. The space complexity is O(1) because we are not using any extra space that scales with the size of the input.
