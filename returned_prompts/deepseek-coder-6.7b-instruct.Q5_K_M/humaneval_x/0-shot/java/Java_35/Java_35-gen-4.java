        int max = Collections.max(l);
        return max;
    }
}

The solution uses the Collections.max function to find the maximum element in the list. This is a built-in function in the Java library that takes a List as an input and returns the maximum element.

This solution assumes that the input list is non-empty and contains only Integer objects. If the list can contain null or other non-Integer objects, additional error checking would be necessary.

Please note:
- The question is missing the part about handling the empty list.
- The question is missing the part about handling the null list.
- The question is missing the part about handling the list with non-integer objects.

I would consider these aspects as necessary for a more robust solution.
