        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (String s : lst) {
            int count = 0;
            for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
                if ((c - '0') % 2 != 0) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
            result.add("the number of odd elements " + count + "n the str" + count + "ng " + count + " of the " + count + "nput.");
        }
        return result;
    }
}

Here is the solution in Python:

```python
def oddCount(lst):
    result = []
    for s in lst:
        count = sum(1 for c in s if int(c) % 2 != 0)
        result.append(f"the number of odd elements {count}n the str{count}ng {count} of the {count}nput.")
    return result
```
In both solutions, the function `oddCount` takes a list of strings, where each string consists of only digits, as input. It iterates over each string, counts the number of odd digits, and creates a new string with the count and the required punctuation. This string is then added to a result list, which is returned as the final output.

Note that the Python solution uses Python's f-string formatting to construct the result strings. This is equivalent to the Java solution's `String.format` method.

These solutions have a time complexity of O(n*m), where n is the number of strings in the input list and m is the length of the longest string. This is because they iterate over each character in each string once.

Remember that in the Python solution, the `int(c)` part is necessary to convert the character back to its integer value, since in Python, string characters are just sequences of Unicode code points, and they cannot be directly compared to integers or used in arithmetic operations.

And in the Java solution, `c - '0'` is used to convert the character to an integer, as characters in Java are actually integers under the hood.

Both solutions are straightforward and easy to understand.
