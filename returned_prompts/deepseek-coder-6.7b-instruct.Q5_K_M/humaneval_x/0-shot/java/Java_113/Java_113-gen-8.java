        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (String str : lst) {
            int count = 0;
            for (char c : str.toCharArray()) {
                if ((c - '0') % 2 != 0) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
            result.add("the number of odd elements in the string " + count + " of the input.");
        }
        return result;
    }
}

This Java program takes a list of strings, counts the number of odd digits in each string and returns a new list of strings with the counts inserted in the required format.

To understand the code, we loop over the list of strings. For each string, we count the number of odd digits by converting each character to an integer using the '0' character as a reference point and checking if the result is odd. If it is, we increment the count. Finally, we add the string with the count inserted in the required format to the result list.

The time complexity of this code is O(n*m), where n is the number of strings in the input list and m is the average length of the strings. The space complexity is O(n), as we are storing each output string in the result list.

The code could be further optimized by using a single loop to count the number of odd digits in each string, but it would not change the time and space complexities.
