        for(int i = n-1; i > 0; i--){
            if(n % i == 0){
                return i;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }

}

My question is, why does this code fail to compile?
This code seems to be correct in terms of logic, but it seems to be failing to compile. I am getting an error message saying: "The type of the expression must be an array type but it resolved to int." 

A: Your for loop is trying to return an int, but it's not in a method that returns a value, so it's not valid.
Here's what you should do:
public static int largestDivisor(int n) {
    for(int i = n-1; i > 0; i--){
        if(n % i == 0){
            return i;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(largestDivisor(15));
}

Here, the main method is the entry point of the program. The largestDivisor method is a static method, so it can be called without creating an instance of the class. The result of the largestDivisor method is then printed to the standard output.

A: Your function is not inside a class, so it needs to be inside a class. Here is the corrected version:
public class Solution {
    public static int largestDivisor(int n) {
        for(int i = n-1; i > 0; i--){
            if(n % i == 0){
                return i;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(largestDivisor(15));
    }
}

The main method is the entry point to any Java program, and the corrected version of your code is in the class Solution.

A: Your main issue is that your method does not belong to any class. Java is an object-oriented programming language and it requires that your methods (and variables) belong to classes.
Here is how you could correct your code:
```
public class Solution {
