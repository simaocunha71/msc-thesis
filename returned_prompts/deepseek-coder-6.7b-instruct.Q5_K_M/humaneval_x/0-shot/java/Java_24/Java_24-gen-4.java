        int largest = 1;
        for(int i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(n); i++) {
            if(n % i == 0) {
                if(n / i == i)
                    largest = i;
                else
                    largest = n / i;
            }

A: The given solution is correct. However, it can be improved by only checking divisors up to the square root of n, because a larger factor of the number would be a multiple of smaller factor that has already been checked.

Here is the improved solution:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    public int largestDivisor(int n) {
        int largest = n;
        for(int i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(n); i++) {
            if(n % i == 0) {
                if(n / i == i)
                    return i;
                else
                    largest = n / i;
            }
        }
        return largest;
    }
}
```

This solution works by iterating from 2 to the square root of n and checking if n is divisible by the current number. If it is, the current number is a divisor of n. If n is divisible by the current number, it checks if the result of the division is equal to the current number. If they are equal, the current number is the largest divisor of n. If they are not equal, the result of the division is the largest divisor of n. The function then returns the largest divisor.

This solution has a time complexity of O(sqrt(n)), which is more efficient than the previous solution.

```java
Solution sol = new Solution();
System.out.println(sol.largestDivisor(15)); // Outputs: 5
```

This program creates a new instance of the Solution class and calls the largestDivisor method with the argument 15. It then prints the result of the method call. In this case, the output is 5, which is the largest divisor of 15.

```java
Solution sol = new Solution();
System.out.println(sol.larg
