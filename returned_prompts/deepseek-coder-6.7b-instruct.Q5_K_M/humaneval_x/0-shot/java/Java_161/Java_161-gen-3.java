A: The function solve() iterates through each character of the string. If the character is a letter, it appends the opposite case of the character to a StringBuilder object. If the character is not a letter, it appends the character itself to the StringBuilder object.

After checking all characters, it returns the reversed string.

So, the function will return the reversed string with all letters having their cases reversed. If the string contains no letters, it will return the reversed string as is.

For example, if the input string is "1234", the function will return "4321" because all characters are not letters and they are reversed. If the input string is "ab", the function will return "AB" because all letters are reversed to uppercase. If the input string is "#a@C", the function will return "#A@c" because the letters 'a' and 'C' are reversed to lowercase.

This solution uses Java's built-in Character class methods to check if a character is a letter and to convert a letter to its opposite case. It also uses a StringBuilder object to efficiently build the reversed string.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string, because it iterates through each character of the string once. The space complexity is also O(n), because it uses a StringBuilder object to build the reversed string.

So, the function solve() meets the problem requirements.

Here is the Java code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    public String solve(String s) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder
