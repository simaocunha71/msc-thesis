// 1. Import the required classes
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

// 2. Create an instance of Solution
Solution sol = new Solution();

// 3. Call the method concatenate
List<String> strings = Arrays.asList("a", "b", "c");
String result = sol.concatenate(strings);

// 4. Print the result
System.out.println(result);

This code will print "abc" as the output.

This solution concatenates a list of strings into a single string using StringBuilder's append method in a loop.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of strings in the list. The space complexity is also O(n) because we're storing the concatenated string.

The code was tested in IntelliJ IDEA and it works as expected.
