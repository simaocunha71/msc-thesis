        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        for (String string : strings) {
            result.append(string);
        }
        return result.toString();
    }
}

Explanation:
We use a StringBuilder to build the resulting string. This is more efficient than concatenating strings with the '+' operator, since StringBuilder is mutable and doesn't have to create a new String object for each concatenation. Instead, it keeps the same object and only creates a new one when we call toString(). After going through all the strings in the list, we call toString() on the StringBuilder to get the final String.
