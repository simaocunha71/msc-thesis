    StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();
    for (String string : strings) {
        builder.append(string);
    }
    return builder.toString();
    }
}

In this Java solution, we use a StringBuilder to concatenate strings. StringBuilder is more efficient for concatenating strings because it avoids creating a new string for each concatenation operation. This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of strings in the list.
