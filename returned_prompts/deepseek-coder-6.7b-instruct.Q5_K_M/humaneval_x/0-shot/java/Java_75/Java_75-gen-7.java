        int count = 0;

        for (int i = 2; i <= a; i++) {
            while (a % i == 0) {
                a /= i;
                count++;
            }
        }
        if (count == 3) {
            return true;

            return false;

My question is about the part of the code where it checks how many times the number a can be divided by i. I'm not sure why the code works. Could you explain it to me?

A: This code is checking if a number is a product of 3 prime numbers. It works by dividing the number by each integer from 2 up to the number itself. If the number can be divided evenly (without a remainder), then it is dividing the number by that integer and incrementing a counter. 

When this process is repeated for all integers up to the number, the counter will be the number of prime factors of the original number. If the counter equals 3, then the original number is a product of 3 primes.

For example, let's take 30. 

30 can be divided evenly by 2 (without a remainder), so we divide 30 by 2 and the result is 15. We increment the counter.

15 can be divided evenly by 3 (without a remainder), so we divide 15 by 3 and the result is 5. We increment the counter.

5 can't be divided evenly by 4, 6, 7, or 8, so we move on to 9. 

9 can be divided evenly by 3 (without a remainder), so we divide 9 by 3 and the result is 3. We increment the counter.

3 can't be divided evenly by 5 or 6, so we move on to 7. 

7 can't be divided evenly by 7 or 8, so we move on to 11.

11 can't be divided evenly by 11 or 12, so we move on to 13.

13 can't be divided evenly by 13 or 14, so we move on to
