A: The logic behind the answer is that a number can be represented as a multiplication of prime numbers only when its prime factors come in pairs. That is, if the prime factors of the number are p1, p2, p3, ..., pk (in some order), then the number can be represented as p1^a1 * p2^a2 * p3^a3 * ... * pk^ak, where ai are non-negative integers.

Now, consider your given example 30 = 2 * 3 * 5. Here, 2 and 5 are prime numbers and they come in pairs. So, the number 30 can be represented as 2^1 * 3^1 * 5^1. Here, all ai are 1, which means the number 30 has odd number of prime factors (i.e., 3 in this case).

So, to check if a number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers, you need to check if the number has odd number of prime factors. This is what the function isMultiplyPrime(int a) is doing.

The function isMultiplyPrime(int a) is first checking if the number is less than 2. If it is, it immediately returns false because numbers less than 2 cannot be prime.

Then, it counts the number of prime factors of the number. To do this, it iterates from 2 to the number itself (inclusive). For each number i, it checks if i is a prime factor of the number by checking if the remainder of the division of the number by i is 0. If i is a prime factor, it keeps dividing the number by i and incrementing the count until the number becomes 1.

Finally, it checks if the count of prime factors is odd. If it is, it returns true, indicating that the number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers. Otherwise, it returns false.
