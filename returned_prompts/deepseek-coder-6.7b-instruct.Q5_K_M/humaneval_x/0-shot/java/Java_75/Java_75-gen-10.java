A: This solution is using a simple brute force approach. 
Firstly, the function will check if the given number is divisible by any number from 2 to a (inclusive). If it is divisible, it means that the number is divisible by that prime number. 

Then, the function increments the count of prime divisors. If the count of prime divisors reaches 3, the function returns true, because we are looking for a number that is the product of 3 different prime numbers. If the count of prime divisors is less than 3, the function returns false. 

The function works by continuously dividing the number by the found prime number until it's no longer divisible. This is done to find all other prime numbers that the original number is divisible by.

For example, let's consider the number 30. It is divisible by 2 and 30 / 2 = 15. It's still divisible by 2, so 15 / 2 = 7. It's not divisible by 2 or 3, so it's divisible by 3 and 30 / 3 = 10. It's divisible by 3 and 10 / 3 = 3. It's not divisible by 3. So, the prime factors of 30 are 2, 3 and 5. There are 3 prime factors, so the function returns true.

Please note that the function does not handle the case when the input number is 1 (as it is not considered a prime number), and it does not check for negative numbers. You may want to add additional checks or handle these cases depending on your specific requirements.

Also, it's worth noting that this solution assumes that the given number is positive. If the given number could be negative, you would need to modify the function to handle this case.

Also, if you're dealing with very large numbers, you may want to consider a more efficient algorithm for finding prime factors.
