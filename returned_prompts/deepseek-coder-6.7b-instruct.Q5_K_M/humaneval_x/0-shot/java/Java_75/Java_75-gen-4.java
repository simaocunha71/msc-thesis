A: Your code is almost correct. Just a little modification is needed. You should check whether the number is divisible by the prime number before incrementing the counter.

Here is the modified version of your code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    public boolean isMultiplyPrime(int a) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 2; i <= a; i++) {
            while (a % i == 0) {
                a = a / i;
                count++;
            }
        }
        if (count == 3)
            return true;
        else
            return false;
    }
}
```

This code works by dividing the input number by each number in ascending order starting from 2. If the number is divisible, it counts the occurrence of that number and continues the process with the result of the division. This continues until the number is no longer divisible by the current number. Once the number is no longer divisible, it moves to the next number. The process continues until it has checked all numbers up to the input number. If the count of prime numbers is 3, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

Please note that this solution assumes that the input number is positive. If negative numbers or 0 are possible inputs, you may need to add additional error checking.

Also, this solution assumes that the input number is a positive integer. If the input number can be a decimal or a fraction, you may need to modify the solution to handle these cases.

Lastly, this solution only works if the number is the product of exactly three different prime numbers. If you want to count the occurrence of the same prime number multiple times, you will need to modify the solution to count the occurrences of each prime number.

I hope this helps, let me know if you have any
