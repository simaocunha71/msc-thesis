        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 2; i < a; i++) {
            if (a % i == 0) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        if (count == 1) {
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }


A: Your function will return true for any single prime number and false for any other number because you're counting how many numbers divide the given one and if the count is exactly one then the number is prime. For any number greater than 2, the only number that can divide it without a remainder is 1, so the count will always be greater than 1. 

To solve your problem, you need to factorize the given number into its prime factors and check if the count of those prime factors is exactly 3.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    public boolean isMultiplyPrime(int a) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 2; i <= a; i++) {
            while (a % i == 0) {
                count++;
                a /= i;
            }
        }
        return count == 3;
    }
}
```

This function will return true if the given number is a multiplication of exactly 3 prime numbers and false otherwise.

For example, isMultiplyPrime(30) will return true because 30 = 2 * 3 * 5.

Please note that this function might not work correctly for very large numbers because of integer overflow.

This function works by iterating over all numbers from 2 to the given number (inclusive), and for each number, it checks if it divides the given number without a remainder. If it does, it increments a counter and divides the given number by the current number. This process continues until the given number becomes 1 (i.e., all its prime factors have been found). Finally, it returns true if the count of prime factors is exactly 3 and false otherwise.
