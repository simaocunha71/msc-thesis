    List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
    for (Object value : values) {
        if (value instanceof Integer) {
            result.add((Integer) value);
        }
    }
    return result;
    }
}

In the answer, we are iterating over the given list of objects. If an object is an instance of Integer, we add it to the result list. Finally, we return the result list which contains only the integers from the original list.

In the question, there are some mistakes. You need to replace 'filter_integers' with 'filterIntergers' and 'Arrays.asList' with 'List.of'. Here is the correct code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    public List<Integer> filterIntergers(List<Object> values) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (Object value : values) {
            if (value instanceof Integer) {
                result.add((Integer) value);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

You can call the function like this:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Solution solution = new Solution();
    List<Object> values = List.of('a', 3.14, 5, 1, 2, 3, "abc", Map.of(), List.of());
    System.out.println(solution.filterIntergers(values)); // prints [5, 1, 2, 3]
}
```
This will print a list of integers from the original list.

Please note that this code is written in Java 8 or later versions. If you are using an older version of Java, you may need to adjust the code a bit to make it compatible.

Also, note that this code assumes that the input list will only contain instances of Integer or other primitive types. If the list could contain other types, you would need to add additional checks to handle them.

Lastly, the question asked for any values, which doesn't make much sense in the context of Java. Java is a statically typed language and therefore requires the programmer to specify the type of each variable. If it'
