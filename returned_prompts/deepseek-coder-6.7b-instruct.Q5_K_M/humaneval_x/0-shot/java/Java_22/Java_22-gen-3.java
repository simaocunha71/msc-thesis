        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (Object value : values) {
            if (value instanceof Integer) {
                result.add((Integer) value);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}

In this code, we iterate over the given list and check if the current element is an instance of the Integer class. If it is, we add it to the result list. Finally, we return the result list.

The function will return a list of integers from the input list.

The time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the size of the input list. This is because we iterate over the input list once. The space complexity is also O(n), where n is the number of integers in the input list. This is because in the worst case, we may need to store all integers in the input list in the result list.

The code is written in Java. It uses the instanceof operator to check if an object is an instance of a certain class. It also uses the List interface and its implementations (ArrayList) to create and manipulate lists.

This code does not handle any exceptions that might occur when casting an object to an Integer. If the input list contains non-Integer objects, this code will throw a ClassCastException at runtime.

This code is a good example of how to use Java's type system to filter a list based on the type of its elements.

A: Here is the revised code. The filter_integers function now filters the list for only integers and returns them as a list.

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    public List<Integer> filterIntegers(List<Object> values) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (Object value : values) {
            if (value instanceof Integer) {
                result.add((Integer) value);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

The function filterIntegers takes a list of Objects as an argument. It iterates over the list and checks if each object is an instance of Integer. If it is, the object is cast to Integer and added to the result list. Finally, the result list is returned.
