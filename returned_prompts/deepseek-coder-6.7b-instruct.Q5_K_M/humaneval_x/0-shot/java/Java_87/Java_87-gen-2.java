The problem is asking for you to find the coordinates of a given number in a 2D list. The coordinates should be sorted first by the row index in ascending order and then by the column index in descending order. 

To solve this, you can loop through the lists and inner lists. If the number you're looking for is found, store its row and column index in a new list. Finally, sort the list of lists based on the row index in ascending order and the column index in descending order.

Here is the code:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> getRow(List<List<Integer>> lst, int x) {
        List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < lst.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < lst.get(i).size(); j++) {
                if (lst.get(i).get(j) == x) {
                    List<Integer> temp = new ArrayList<>();
                    temp.add(i);
                    temp.add
