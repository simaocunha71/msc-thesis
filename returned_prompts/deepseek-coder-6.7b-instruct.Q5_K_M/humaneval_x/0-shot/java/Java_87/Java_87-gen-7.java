The program works by iterating over the 2D list to find all occurrences of the value x. For each occurrence, it creates a list containing the row and column indices, and adds this list to the result. It then sorts the result first by row (ascending), then by column (descending). The sorting is done using a custom Comparator.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n*m), where n is the number of rows and m is the maximum number of columns in the 2D list. This is because it needs to iterate over all elements in the 2D list to find all occurrences of x. The space complexity is O(k), where k is the number of occurrences of x in the list. This is because it needs to store all occurrences in the result list.

The solution assumes that the 2D list contains only integers, and that the given integer x is also an integer. It does not handle cases where the input is not a 2D list or where the list contains non-integer values.

The solution also assumes that the 2D list does not contain any null values. If the list can contain null values, the solution would need to be
