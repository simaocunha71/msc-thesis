        List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < lst.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < lst.get(i).size(); j++) {
                if (lst.get(i).get(j) == x) {
                    List<Integer> coordinate = new ArrayList<>();
                    coordinate.add(i);
                    coordinate.add(j);
                    result.add(coordinate);
                }
            }
        }

        // Sort coordinates by rows in ascending order and by columns in descending order.
        result.sort(Comparator.comparing((List<Integer> c) -> c.get(0)).thenComparing(c -> c.get(1), Comparator.reverseOrder()));

        return result;

}

The code begins by initializing an empty List of Lists to hold the results. It then iterates over the outer list to get each row, and then iterates over each row to get each column. If the value at the current position matches x, it creates a new List with the current row and column, adds this List to the result, and then continues to the next position.

Finally, it sorts the result List first by the first element of each List (i.e., the row), and then by the second element (i.e., the column), but in descending order. The result is then returned.

Note that the Comparator.reverseOrder() is used to sort the columns in descending order.

This solution runs in O(n*m) time, where n is the number of rows and m is the average number of columns in the rows.

Also, it uses O(n) extra space for storing the result.

The space complexity can be optimized to O(1) by modifying the input list if we don't want to use extra space.
