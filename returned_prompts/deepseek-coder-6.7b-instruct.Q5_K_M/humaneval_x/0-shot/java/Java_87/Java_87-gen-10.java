Explanation:
This solution works by iterating through each element in the list of lists (similar to a matrix), and checking if it matches the integer x. If it does, then the coordinates of that element are added to the list of coordinates.

The coordinates are then sorted first by rows (the first element of each coordinate list), then by columns (the second element of each coordinate list). The sorting is done using a custom Comparator that checks the first element of each list and sorts them in ascending order, and then it checks the second element of each list and sorts them in descending order.

Finally, the sorted list of coordinates is returned.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the total number of elements in the list of lists. This is because it iterates through each element in the list of lists once.

The space complexity of this solution is also O(n), where n is the total number of elements in the list of lists. This is because it stores each coordinate as a list in a new list.

Overall, this solution is efficient and works correctly for the given problem.
