        if(n>m){
            return -1;
        }
        int avg = (int)Math.ceil((n+m)/2.0);
        return Integer.toBinaryString(avg);
    }
}

Explanation:
We first check if n is greater than m, and if so we return -1. We then calculate the average of n and m, rounding up to the nearest integer. This is achieved by adding n and m together and dividing by 2.0 (to allow for decimal places). We then use the Math.ceil() method to round up to the nearest integer. This average is then converted to binary using the Integer.toBinaryString() method. This binary string is then returned.
