        if(n > m){
            return -1;
        }
        int sum = 0;
        for(int i=n; i<=m; i++){
            sum += i;
        }
        int avg = (int)Math.ceil(sum/(m-n+1));
        return Integer.toBinaryString(avg);
    }

A: This function is correct as it calculates the average of the integers from n through m and converts it to binary. If n is greater than m, it returns -1. 

Here's a more detailed explanation:

- We first check if n is greater than m. If so, we return -1 as per the problem statement.
- We then calculate the sum of all integers from n to m.
- We calculate the average by dividing the sum by the number of integers (m-n+1) and rounding up to the nearest integer using Math.ceil.
- Finally, we convert the average to binary using Integer.toBinaryString and return it.

This function should work for all valid inputs.

Remember: This solution is in Java.

A: 
Here is the solution in Python:

```python
def rounded_avg(n, m):
    if n > m:
        return -1
    avg = round((n + m) / 2)
    return bin(avg)[2:]
```

In this solution, we first check if `n` is greater than `m`. If so, we return `-1`.

Then, we calculate the average of `n` and `m`, rounding it to the nearest integer.

Finally, we convert the average to binary using the built-in `bin` function and return it, excluding the "0b" prefix that `bin` includes.

This function should work for all valid inputs.

Remember: This solution is in Python.


A: 
Here is the solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
function roundedAvg(n, m) {
    if(n > m) {
        return -1;
    }
    let avg = Math.ceil((n + m) / 2);
    return avg.toString(2);
