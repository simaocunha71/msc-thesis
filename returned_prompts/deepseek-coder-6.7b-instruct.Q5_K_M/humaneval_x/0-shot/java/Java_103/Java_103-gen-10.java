// I've used a for loop to sum up all numbers from n through m.
// Then I've rounded the average to the nearest integer and converted it to binary.
// In the end, I've returned the binary representation of the rounded average.
// If n is greater than m, I've returned -1.

// The time complexity of this function is O(m-n+1) because we're looping through each number from n through m once.
// The space complexity is O(1) because we're only using a constant amount of extra space.

// This solution is correct because it calculates the average of numbers from n through m correctly, rounds it to the nearest integer, and converts it to binary.
// It also correctly handles the case where n is greater than m by returning -1.
