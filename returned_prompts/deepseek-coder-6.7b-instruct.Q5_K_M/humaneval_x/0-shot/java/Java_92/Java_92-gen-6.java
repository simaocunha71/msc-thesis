        //Check if x,y,z are integers

            //Calculate the sum of x and y

            //Check if either x is equal to the sum of y and z, or y is equal to the sum of x and z, or z is equal to the sum of x and y
            if(x == sum || y == sum || z == sum){
                return true;
            }

        //Return false in any other cases
        return false;

A: If your compiler allows using the == operator for comparison between boxed primitive types (like Integer) and their corresponding primitive types (like int), this problem can be solved.
Here is the corrected code:
public boolean anyInt(Integer x, Integer y, Integer z) {
    //Check if x,y,z are integers
    if(x instanceof Integer && y instanceof Integer && z instanceof Integer){
        //Calculate the sum of x and y
        int sum = x + y;

        //Check if either x is equal to the sum of y and z, or y is equal to the sum of x and z, or z is equal to the sum of x and y
        if(x == sum || y == sum || z == sum){
            return true;
        }
    }
    //Return false in any other cases
    return false;
}

Here, x + y will return int, and == will compare int with Integer.

A: You can't compare an Integer with an int directly, because they are different types. However, you can do the comparison within the if condition using the intValue() method, which returns the int value of the Integer.
Here is the corrected code:
public boolean anyInt(Integer x, Integer y, Integer z) {
    //Check if x,y,z are integers
    if(x instanceof Integer && y instanceof Integer && z instanceof Integer){
        //Calculate the sum of x and y
        int sum = x.intValue() + y.intValue();

        //Check if either x is equal to the sum of y and z, or y is equal to the sum of x and z, or
