The function checks if all the inputs are integers and if the sum of the first two numbers equals the third number. The function returns true if that's the case, false otherwise.

The function "anyInt" takes in three Objects as parameters because Java is a statically typed language. This means we can't directly compare Objects to Integers and we have to cast them to Integers.

The function first checks if all inputs are integers. If not, it immediately returns false.

If all inputs are integers, the function calculates the sum of the first two integers and compares it to the third integer. If they are equal, the function returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

The function uses the "instanceof" operator to check if the inputs are integers. The "instanceof" operator returns true if the object is an instance of the specified type.

The function uses the "==" operator to compare the third integer to the sum of the first two integers. The "==" operator returns true if the two operands are equal.

The function uses the "+" operator to add the first two integers.

The function uses the "return" statement to return a value. The "return" statement specifies the value that the function returns.

The function uses the "{}" brackets to encapsulate the code of the function. The "{}" brackets delimit the code of the function.

The function uses the "boolean" keyword to declare the return type of the function. The "boolean" keyword specifies that the function returns a boolean value.

The function uses the "public" keyword to declare the access level of the function. The "public" keyword specifies that the function can be accessed from anywhere.

The function uses the "class" keyword to declare the class of the function. The "class" keyword specifies that the function is a method of the Solution class.

The function uses the "static" keyword to declare the context of the function. The "static" keyword specifies that the function belongs to the Solution class, not to an instance of the S
