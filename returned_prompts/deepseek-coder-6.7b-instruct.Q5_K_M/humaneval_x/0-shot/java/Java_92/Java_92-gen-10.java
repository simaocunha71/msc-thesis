A: The function anyInt takes three parameters x, y, and z. These parameters are Object types because it is specified in the problem that the inputs could be of any type. However, in the function, we are casting the parameters to Integer type because we are only dealing with integers.

The first if statement checks if the parameters are instances of Integer type. If not, it returns false. 

The next two lines cast the parameters to integers so that we can perform arithmetic operations. 

In the last two lines, we check if the sum of any two numbers is equal to the third number. If it is, the function returns true. If not, it returns false.

This function will work for any integer inputs and return true if any of the inputs are equal to the sum of the other two integers and false otherwise.

Note: In Java, it's generally not recommended to use Object as the type of a parameter. If possible, you should use specific types to make your code more type-safe. 

Also, it's important to note that the problem statement seems to be misleading. It says that the function should return true if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two, but in the examples provided, it doesn't seem to be the case. So, if the problem statement is indeed misleading, you might want to reconsider it.

Also, the function should be named as per the problem statement. The name "anyInt" is not a good name for a function that takes three parameters and returns a boolean value. The function name should reflect what the function does.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
class Solution {
    /**
    Create a function that takes 3 numbers.
    Returns true if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two, and all numbers are integers.
    Returns false in any other
