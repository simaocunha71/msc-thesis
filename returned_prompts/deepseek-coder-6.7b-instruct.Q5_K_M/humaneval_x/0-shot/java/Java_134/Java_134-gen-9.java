        if(txt.length()==0){
            return false;
        }
        if(Character.isLetter(txt.charAt(txt.length()-1))){
            if(txt.length()==1){
                return true;
            }
            if(txt.charAt(txt.length()-2)==' '){
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}

The function works by first checking if the string is empty. If it is, it returns false. If the string is not empty, it checks if the last character is a letter. If it is, it checks if it's the only character in the string or if the character before it is a space, indicating that it's not part of a word. If both conditions are met, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

This solution has a time complexity of O(1) and a space complexity of O(1), as it only performs a fixed number of operations that do not depend on the size of the input string.

This function is a good example of how to efficiently solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller, manageable steps and checking each one individually.

The function's performance is also good because it checks only the last character of the string, which is the most significant character in the string. This makes it a fast solution.
