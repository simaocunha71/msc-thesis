        // Base case if string is empty
        if (txt.length() == 0)
            return false;

        // Get last character
        char lastChar = txt.charAt(txt.length() - 1);

        // Check if it is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word
        if (Character.isLetter(lastChar) && !Character.isLetter(txt.charAt(txt.length() - 2)))
            return true;
        else
            return false;
    }
}

The solution first checks if the string is empty. If it is, the function returns false. Then it gets the last character from the string and checks if it is an alphabetical character. If it is, it checks if the character before it is also a letter (this means it is part of a word). If it is, the function returns false. If the character before it is not a letter (meaning it is not part of a word), the function returns true.

The solution assumes that the string will not contain special characters or numbers. If this is not the case, the function will need to be updated to handle these cases.

Also, the function assumes that the string will not contain spaces at the end. If this is not the case, the function will need to be updated to handle these cases.

The function does not handle multiple spaces between words, it will return true for "apple  pi e", it should return false. If you want to handle multiple spaces, you will need to update the function to split the string into words and check if the last word ends with a letter.

The function does not handle the case where the string contains a single letter, it will return true for "a", it should return false. If you want to handle this case, you will need to update the function to check if the string contains more than one character.

The function does not handle the case where the string contains a single letter at the end of a word, it will return true for "apple a", it should return false. If you want to handle this case, you will need to update the function to check if the character before it is a space or the start of the string.
