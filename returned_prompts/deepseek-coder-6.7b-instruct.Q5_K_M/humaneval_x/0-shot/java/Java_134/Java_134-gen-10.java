        if (txt.isEmpty())
            return false;
        char lastChar = txt.charAt(txt.length() - 1);
        if (!Character.isLetter(lastChar))
            return false;
        if (txt.length() == 1)
            return true;
        char secondLastChar = txt.charAt(txt.length() - 2);
        return !Character.isLetter(secondLastChar);
    }
}

Explanation:
The function checkIfLastCharIsALetter checks if the last character of the string is a letter. If it's not a letter, it immediately returns false. If it is a letter, it checks if the second last character is also a letter. If the second last character is also a letter, it returns false. If the second last character is not a letter, it means that the last character is not part of a word and is a letter, so it returns true.

The function also handles the case when the string is empty, in which case it also returns false.

The function uses the Character.isLetter method to check if a character is a letter. The function also uses the charAt method to get the characters at specified positions in the string. The length method is used to get the length of the string.

The function does not use any other classes or methods from the Java standard library.

The function has a time complexity of O(1) because it always executes a constant number of operations, regardless of the size of the input string. Its space complexity is also O(1), because it always uses the same amount of memory, regardless of the size of the input string.

This function is correct according to the problem statement.
