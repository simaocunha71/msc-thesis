The answer is correct. The code is using the modulo operator to isolate the last digit of the input number. If this digit is odd, it is multiplied with the current product. This operation is performed for each digit in the input number. If no odd digit is found, the product remains 1, which is then returned.


In the provided example,

digits(1)  == 1, because only one odd digit 1.

digits(4)  == 0, because there is no odd digit.

digits(235) == 15, because the odd digits are 3 and 5 and their product is 15.

So, the code is correctly returning the product of the odd digits in a number.


Note:
This code does not handle negative integers as per the problem statement. If negative integers are possible inputs, the code should be modified to check for this and handle it appropriately.


Time Complexity: O(d), where d is the number of digits in n.
Space Complexity: O(1), as no additional space is used that scales with the size of the input.


The code is correct and efficient as it iterates through the digits of the input number exactly once.
