The given solution is correct and efficient. It works by taking each digit from right to left (by using n % 10) and then removing that digit from the number (by using n /= 10). 

For each digit, it checks if that digit is odd by using the modulus operator (digit % 2 != 0). If the digit is odd, it multiplies the result by that digit. The variable isOdd is used to check if there was at least one odd digit in the input number. If there was not, the method returns 0.

The time complexity of this solution is O(number of digits), which is the best possible time complexity for this problem, because we have to visit each digit at least once. The space complexity is O(1), which is the best possible space complexity for this problem, because we are using a constant amount of space to store the result and the isOdd variable.

Therefore, the given solution is optimal for this problem.

Note: The problem description states that the input is a positive integer, but the solution does not account for negative numbers or zero. If these inputs are possible, the solution would need to be modified to handle these cases.

In summary, the given solution is correct, efficient, and correctly solves the problem.
