        int product = 1;
        boolean flag = false;

        while(n > 0){
            int digit = n % 10;
            n /= 10;

            if(digit % 2 != 0){
                product *= digit;
                flag = true;
            }
        }

        return flag ? product : 0;
    }
}

The given code works by iterating through each digit of the number n and checks if it is an odd number. If it is, it multiplies it to a running total (product) and sets the flag to true. If there is at least one odd digit, it returns the product. If not, it returns 0.

Test Cases:

1. digits(1)  => 1
2. digits(4)  => 0
3. digits(235) => 15

This code has a time complexity of O(d) where d is the number of digits in n. It also has a space complexity of O(1) as it uses a constant amount of space.

The code is correct and should pass all test cases.
