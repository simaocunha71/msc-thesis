This solution uses Kadane's algorithm to find the minimum subarray sum. It maintains a running sum of the array and resets it to the current value if it's smaller than the current value. The minimum sum is updated every iteration to the smaller of the current sum and the minSum.

This solution runs in O(n) time and uses O(1) space.

The test cases provided are correct.

The runtime complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array. This is because we are performing a single pass over the array. 

The space complexity is O(1), as we are using a constant amount of space to store our variables.
