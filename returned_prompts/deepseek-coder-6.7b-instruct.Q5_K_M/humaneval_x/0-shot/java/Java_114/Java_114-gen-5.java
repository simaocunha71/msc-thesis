        int sum = nums.get(0);
        int min = nums.get(0);

        for(int i = 1; i < nums.size(); i++){
            sum = Math.min(nums.get(i), sum + nums.get(i));
            min = Math.min(min, sum);

In this solution, the idea is to keep track of the minimum sum of subarrays that end at each index. The minimum sum of a subarray that ends at index i is either the number at index i itself (in which case the sum is reset to 0, since we've found a new subarray) or the minimum sum of a subarray that ends at index i-1 plus the number at index i (in which case we extend the subarray by one element). We keep track of the minimum sum found so far.

In the worst case, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input list.

The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the sum and min.

This solution assumes that the input list is non-empty. If this is not guaranteed, you should add appropriate error checking.

I also assumed that the input list will contain only positive integers, as the problem statement doesn't specify how negative numbers or zeroes should be handled. If this is not the case, you should modify the solution accordingly.

This solution also assumes that the input list will not contain any null values. If this is not the case, you should add appropriate error checking to handle these cases.

This solution also assumes that the input list will not contain any Integer.MAX_VALUE values. If this is not the case, you should modify the solution to handle these cases.

This solution assumes that the input list will not contain any Integer.MIN_VALUE values. If this is not the case, you should modify the solution to handle these cases.

This solution assumes that the input list will not contain any values that are larger than Integer.MAX_VALUE. If this is not the case, you should modify the solution to handle these cases.

This solution assumes that the input list will not contain any values that are smaller than Integer.MIN_VALUE. If this is not the case
