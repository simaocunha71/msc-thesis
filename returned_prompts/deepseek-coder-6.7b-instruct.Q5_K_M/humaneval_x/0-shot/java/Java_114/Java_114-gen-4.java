        int min_sum = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int curr_sum = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            curr_sum += nums.get(i);
            if (curr_sum < min_sum) {
                min_sum = curr_sum;
            }
            curr_sum = Math.min(curr_sum, 0);
        }

        return min_sum;
    }
}

The code above initializes the min_sum to the maximum value of an integer and curr_sum to 0. Then it iterates over the list of integers and adds each integer to curr_sum. If curr_sum is less than min_sum, it updates min_sum. At the same time, it also resets curr_sum to the minimum of curr_sum and 0, which effectively "removes" the lowest sum subarray it has found so far.

The result is the smallest sum of any non-empty subarray.

It is important to note that this solution assumes that the given list of integers only contains positive and negative integers. If the list can also contain 0s, then the solution should be modified to handle that case.

In the case of having 0s in the list, the solution should return 0 as it means the array is already sorted in ascending order.

A: The question is asking for the minimum subarray sum. A subarray sum is the sum of elements in a subarray. The sum of an empty subarray is 0.

Here is a Python solution using Kadane's algorithm. This algorithm is an efficient way to solve this problem.

def minSubArraySum(nums):
    current_sum = min_sum = nums[0]
    for num in nums[1:]:
        current_sum = min(num, current_sum + num)
        min_sum = min(min_sum, current_sum)
    return min_sum

In this solution, we initialize the current_sum and min_sum to the first number in the list. Then we iterate through the list starting from the second number. For each number, we update the current
