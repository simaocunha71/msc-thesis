        int minSum = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int currentSum = 0;

        for (int num : nums) {
            currentSum = Math.min(currentSum + num, num);
            minSum = Math.min(minSum, currentSum);
        }

        return minSum;
    }
}

Explanation:
The algorithm works by iterating over the array of integers. For each integer, it calculates the sum of the current integer and the current sum. This new sum becomes the new current sum if it is smaller, or the current integer if the current sum is smaller. This is done because we want the smallest sum of any non-empty sub-array.

In the same iteration, it also updates the minimum sum found so far. This is done by comparing the minimum sum found so far with the current sum. If the current sum is smaller, it becomes the new minimum sum.

The algorithm finally returns the minimum sum found.

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array, because it makes a single pass over the array. It also has a space complexity of O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the current sum and the minimum sum.

This solution is based on Kadane's algorithm, which is used to solve the maximum sum subarray problem. It is modified to find the minimum sum subarray instead of the maximum sum.

It's important to note that this solution assumes that the input list is not empty. If there is a chance that the input list could be empty, you should add a check for this condition at the beginning of the method.
