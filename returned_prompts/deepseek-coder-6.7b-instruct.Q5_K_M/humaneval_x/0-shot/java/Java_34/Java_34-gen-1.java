        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>(l);
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>(set);
        Collections.sort(result);
        return result;
    }
}


A: I'd suggest using a TreeSet, which automatically removes duplicates and sorts the elements as they're added. Here is how you can do it:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    public List<Integer> unique(List<Integer> l) {
        TreeSet<Integer> set = new TreeSet<>(l);
        return new ArrayList<>(set);
    }
}
```

The TreeSet automatically removes duplicates and sorts the elements as they're added. We then convert the TreeSet back to an ArrayList and return it.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting operation.

Here's how you can use it:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Solution solution = new Solution();
    List<Integer> result = solution.unique(Arrays.asList(5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123));
    System.out.println(result); // Output: [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]
}
```

This will print the sorted unique elements of the list.

Note: The original question asked for a solution with a time complexity of O(n). This solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation. If you need a solution with a time complexity of O(n), you'll need to use a different approach.


A: Here's a one-liner solution using Java 8 Streams:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.util.stream.*;

class Solution {
    public List<Integer> unique(List<Integer> l) {
        return l.stream().distinct().sorted().collect(Collectors.toList());
    }
}
```

This one-liner does the same thing as the previous solution, but in a more concise
