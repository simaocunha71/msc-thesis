        Set<Integer> set = new TreeSet<>(l);
        return new ArrayList<>(set);
    }
}


A: I believe your answer is correct. 

Here is your code:

```
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution  {
    /**
    Return sorted unique elements in a list
    >>> unique(Arrays.asList(5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123))
    [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]
      */
    public List<Integer> unique(List<Integer> l) {
        Set<Integer> set = new TreeSet<>(l);
        return new ArrayList<>(set);
    }
}
```

In this code, we are using a set to remove duplicate elements. A set in Java does not allow duplicate elements, so when we add all the elements from the list to the set, any duplicates will be removed. We then convert the set back to a list and return it. Since sets are inherently sorted, we get a sorted list as a result.

Also, you can use Java 8's Stream API for this problem which makes the code cleaner and more readable.

Here is the Java 8 version of the same code:

```
import java.util.stream.*;

class Solution {
    public List<Integer> unique(List<Integer> l) {
        return l.stream().distinct().sorted().collect(Collectors.toList());
    }
}
```

In this version, we use the stream() method to convert the list to a Stream. The distinct() method removes duplicates, sorted() method sorts the elements and finally, collect(Collectors.toList()) method converts the result back to a list.

Both versions of the code do the same thing, but the second one is more concise and idiomatic in Java 8.

Hope, it helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.


A: Your code is correct. It uses the TreeSet class to remove duplicate elements and then converts the TreeSet back to an ArrayList. The ArrayList is then returned.
