        Set<Integer> uniqueSet = new TreeSet<>(l);
        return new ArrayList<>(uniqueSet);
    }
}


A: Your code is almost correct. However, you are missing the part where you will print the result.

Here is the complete code with the print statement:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    /**
    Return sorted unique elements in a list
    >>> unique(Arrays.asList(5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123))
     [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]
     */
    public List<Integer> unique(List<Integer> l) {
        Set<Integer> uniqueSet = new TreeSet<>(l);
        return new ArrayList<>(uniqueSet);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args){
        Solution s = new Solution();
        List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123);
        System.out.println(s.unique(list));
    }
}
```

In this code, I have added a main method in which I'm creating an object of the Solution class and calling the unique method with a test list. The result is printed to the console.

This code will work as expected and print [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123] to the console.

Make sure to run this in a Java environment.
