        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>(l);
        List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>(set);
        Collections.sort(list);
        return list;
    }
}


A: Here's the solution:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    /**
    Return sorted unique elements in a list
    >>> unique(Arrays.asList(5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123))
    [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]
    */
    public List<Integer> unique(List<Integer> l) {
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>(l);
        List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>(set);
        Collections.sort(list);
        return list;
    }
}
```

Explanation:

In the above solution, we're using a HashSet which automatically removes duplicates and stores the elements in no particular order. Then we're converting this set back into a List and sorting it using the Collections.sort() function. Finally, we're returning the sorted list.

This solution is O(n log n) because of the sorting, where n is the number of unique elements in the list.

It's important to note that the order of elements in the original list is not preserved in this solution. If you need to preserve the original order, you would need to use a different approach.

Also, the solution assumes that the list contains only Integers. If the list can contain other types of objects, you would need to modify the solution to handle those types.

And lastly, the solution works in Java 8 and later versions. If you're using an earlier version of Java, you may need to adjust the syntax to use the older Collection classes like ArrayList and LinkedList.

Note: The code provided is a simple implementation and doesn't handle edge cases or exceptional scenarios. You might need to add error handling code based on your specific requirements.
