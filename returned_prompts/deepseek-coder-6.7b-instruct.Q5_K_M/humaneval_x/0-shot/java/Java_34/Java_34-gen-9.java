        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>(l);
        List<Integer> uniqueList = new ArrayList<>(set);
        Collections.sort(uniqueList);
        return uniqueList;
    }
}


A: 
I'm not sure what the question is asking for. It appears to be asking for a function that takes a list of integers, removes duplicate numbers, sorts the numbers, and then returns the sorted list of unique numbers. The provided function does exactly that.
