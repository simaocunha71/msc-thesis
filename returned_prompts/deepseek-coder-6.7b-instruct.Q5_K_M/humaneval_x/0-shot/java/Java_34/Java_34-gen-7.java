        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<Integer>(l);
        List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<Integer>(set);

A: The solution you provided is correct. It uses a HashSet to remove duplicate values and then converts the set back to a list before sorting it.

In Java, a HashSet is a collection of items where every item is unique. It is an unordered collection of items. It does not maintain the insertion order and permits null elements.

So, when you pass your list to a HashSet, any duplicate elements will be removed. Then you convert the HashSet back to a List and sort it using Collections.sort().

So, overall, your solution is correct and efficient.

A: Yes, the solution given is correct. It uses a HashSet to remove duplicate values and then converts the set back to a list before sorting it.

Here is the code in a more readable format:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public List<Integer> unique(List<Integer> l) {
        // Converting the list to a set to remove duplicates
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>(l);
        // Converting the set back to a list
        List<Integer> uniqueList = new ArrayList<>(set);
        // Sorting the list
        Collections.sort(uniqueList);
        // Returning the sorted list of unique elements
        return uniqueList;
    }
}
```

This code first removes the duplicates from the list by converting it to a set, then it converts the set back to a list, and finally it sorts the list before returning it.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the list. This is because the sorting operation takes O(n log n) time. The space complexity is O(n), because we are using an additional set to remove the duplicates.

So, it is a correct and efficient solution.

Also, keep in mind that this code assumes that the input list contains Integer objects. If you try to use it with a list of other types, you will get a compile-
