The code you provided is correct. It will return a sorted list of odd numbers in the Collatz sequence for the input n. 

First, it initializes an empty ArrayList odds. Then, it enters a loop that continues until n is equal to 1. Inside the loop, it checks if n is an odd number by checking if the remainder of n divided by 2 is not 0. If n is odd, it adds n to the ArrayList odds. Then, it updates n according to the Collatz sequence rules. After the loop, it adds 1 to the ArrayList odds (since the last number in the Collatz sequence is always 1), and sorts the ArrayList. Finally, it returns the sorted ArrayList. 

So for example, if you call getOddCollatz(5), it will return [1, 5] because the odd numbers in the Collatz sequence for 5 are 1 and 5.

The Collections.sort(odds) line is not strictly necessary in this case since the ArrayList odds is always sorted after adding an element. But it does not hurt and makes the code more readable.
