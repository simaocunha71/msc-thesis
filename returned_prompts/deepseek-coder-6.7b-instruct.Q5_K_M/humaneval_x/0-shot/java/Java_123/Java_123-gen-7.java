        List<Integer> oddNumbers = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        while (n != 1) {
            if (n % 2 != 0) {
                oddNumbers.add(n);
            }
            n = n % 2 == 0 ? n / 2 : 3 * n + 1;
        }
        oddNumbers.add(1);
        Collections.sort(oddNumbers);
        return oddNumbers;
    }
}

```

## Solution:

The solution works by generating the Collatz sequence for the given number `n`. If a number in the sequence is odd, it's added to the list `oddNumbers`. After the loop finishes, `1` is added to the list since every Collatz sequence ends with `1`. Finally, the list `oddNumbers` is sorted in increasing order before it's returned.

The Collatz sequence is generated in the while loop, where `n` is updated according to the Collatz rules. If `n` is even, it's divided by 2, and if it's odd, it's multiplied by 3 and 1 is added. This continues until `n` becomes `1`.

This solution assumes that the input `n` is always a positive integer greater than or equal to `1`. If this is not the case, additional error checking should be added.

## Complexity:

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) as it iterates through the Collatz sequence until `n` becomes `1`. The space complexity is also O(n) as it stores the odd numbers in the list `oddNumbers`.

## Test Cases:

Here are some test cases you can use to test the solution:

```java
System.out.println(getOddCollatz(5));  // Expected output: [1, 5]
System.out.println(getOddCollatz(10)); // Expected output: [1, 11, 22]
System.out.println(getOddCollatz(15)); // Expected output: [1, 15, 46, 23, 60]
