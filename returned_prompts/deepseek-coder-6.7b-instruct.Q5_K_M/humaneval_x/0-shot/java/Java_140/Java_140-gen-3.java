## Explanation:

This solution uses a StringBuilder to build the output string. It iterates over the input string, checking each character. If the character is a space, it increments a count of consecutive spaces. If the count is 1, it appends an underscore to the output string. If the count is greater than 1, it appends a dash to the output string. If the character is not a space, it appends the character to the output string and resets the count of consecutive spaces.

This solution assumes that the input string is well-formed and does not contain any other special characters. If the input string can contain other special characters, the solution would need to be updated accordingly.

## Time and Space Complexity:

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because the solution iterates over the input string once.

The space complexity of this solution is also O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because the solution uses a StringBuilder to build the output string, which can potentially be up to the size of the input string.

## Test Cases:

Here are some test cases for the `fixSpaces` method:

```java
Solution solution = new Solution();

System.out.println(solution.fixSpaces("Example")); // Expected: "Example"
System.out.println(solution.fixSpaces("Example 1")); // Expected: "Example_1"
System.out.println(solution.fixSpaces
