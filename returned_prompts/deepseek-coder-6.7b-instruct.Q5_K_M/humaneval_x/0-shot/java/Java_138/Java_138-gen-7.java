        if (n <= 10) {
            return false;
        } else if (n % 2 == 1) {
            return false;
        } else {
            return true;
        }
    }
}


A: The problem statement is contradictory. 

Evaluate whether the given number n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers

This implies that the number n has to be the sum of exactly 4 even numbers. The problem statement doesn't mention about whether these numbers can be distinct or not. Also, the problem statement doesn't provide any constraints about the range of the input. 

If the input number is an even number, it can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers (2, 2, 2, 2).

Here is the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution  {
    public boolean isEqualToSumEven(int n) {
        if (n % 2 == 0 && n >= 8) {
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
}
```

This code checks if the input number is even and greater than or equal to 8. If it is, the function returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

Please revise the problem statement to clarify the requirements.


A: You could solve this problem by checking if the given number can be written as the sum of 4 distinct even numbers. The smallest even number is 2, so you can start checking from 2 to the square root of the given number. If you find four such numbers, you can return true. Otherwise, you return false.

Here is the corrected Java code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    public boolean isEqualToSumEven(int n) {
        for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; i += 2) {
            if (isEqualToSumEven(n, i)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    private boolean isEqualToSumEven(int n, int start) {
        int count = 1, sum =
