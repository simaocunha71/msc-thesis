        int sum = 0;
        for(int i = 2; i <= n; i += 2){
            for(int j = i+2; j <= n; j += 2){
                for(int k = j+2; k <= n; k += 2){
                    for(int l = k+2; l <= n; l += 2){
                        if(i + j + k + l == n){
                            return true;
                        }
                    }

In the above code, we are trying to find four numbers that sum up to the given number n. We start from 2, because we only want to consider even numbers. Inside the nested loops, we increment by 2 each time to ensure we only consider even numbers. If we find a combination of four numbers that sum up to n, we return true. If no such combination is found after checking all possible combinations, we return false. This solution is not efficient, but it works for small inputs.

Note: This solution does not take into account that the problem is asking for exactly four positive even numbers, and it does not handle the case where n is odd.

Edit: This solution does not work for large inputs because its time complexity is O(n^4), which is too high. For large inputs, we need to use a more efficient algorithm.

Here's the more efficient solution:

```java
public boolean isEqualToSumEven(int n) {
    if (n < 8 || n % 2 != 0) {
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

This solution works by first checking if n is less than 8 or if it's not even. If either of these conditions is true, it returns false. Otherwise, it returns true. This solution is more efficient because its time complexity is O(1), which is much better than the previous solution's time complexity of O(n^4).

This solution assumes that the problem is asking for exactly four positive even numbers that sum up to n, and it handles the case where n is odd.
