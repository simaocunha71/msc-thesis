        if (n < 4 || n % 2 != 0) {
            return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}

This solution is correct as it checks if the given number is greater than or equal to 4 and is even. If it is, then it can be written as the sum of 4 positive even numbers, so it returns true. If it isn't, it returns false.
