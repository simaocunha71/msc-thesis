Explanation:
This program checks if a number n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. The function loops through all the even numbers less than n and for each even number, it checks if it can be combined with any other even number to get the sum of n. If it finds 4 such pairs, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

This solution is not optimal and it has a time complexity of O(n^2) which is not efficient for large numbers. A more optimized solution would involve using a mathematical approach to solve this problem.

It is important to note that the problem statement is incorrect. It is not possible to write any positive integer as the sum of exactly 4 even numbers. If n is an even number, then it can be written as the sum of 2 even numbers which are 2 and n-2. If n is odd, then it can be written as the sum of 3 even numbers which are 2, 4 and n-6.

Here is the corrected program:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    public boolean isEqualToSumEven(int n) {
        if(n % 2 == 1) return false;
        return true;
    }
}
```

This program simply checks if the number is even or odd. If it's even, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

// Test the function
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        System.out.println(solution.isEqualToSumEven(4));  // false
        System.out.println(solution.isEqualToSumEven(6));  // false
