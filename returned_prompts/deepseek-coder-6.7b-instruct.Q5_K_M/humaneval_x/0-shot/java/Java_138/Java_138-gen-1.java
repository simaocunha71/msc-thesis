I've been trying to solve this problem for a while now and I can't seem to find the issue. I'm new to programming and don't know what's wrong. The logic seems to be correct, but it's not working as expected.

A: Your code works correctly if you want to find out if a number can be expressed as a sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers.

However, the problem description mentions "exactly 4 positive even numbers", but your code sums up numbers until it reaches the target or exceeds it. It seems like you want to find exactly 4 numbers, not sum up numbers.

Here is the corrected code:
public boolean isEqualToSumFourEven(int n) {
    if (n <= 0 || n % 2 != 0) {
        return false;
    }

    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n && count < 4; i += 2) {
        count++;
        if (count == 4) {
            return i == n;
        }
    }
    return false;
}

In this code, we start from 2 (the smallest even number) and keep adding 2 to the sum until we reach or exceed the given number. We keep a count of the numbers added. If we added exactly 4 numbers and their sum equals the given number, we return true. If not, we return false.

Also, we ensure that the given number is positive and even before we start the loop.

This code assumes that you want to find a combination of exactly 4 even numbers that sum to the given number. If you want different behavior, please specify it.

A: Your problem is that you're trying to find all combinations of
