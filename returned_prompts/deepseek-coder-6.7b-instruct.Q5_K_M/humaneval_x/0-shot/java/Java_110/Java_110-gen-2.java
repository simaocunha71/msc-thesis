        int oddCount = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < lst1.size(); i++) {
            if (lst1.get(i) % 2 != 0) {
                oddCount++;
            }
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < lst2.size(); i++) {
            if (lst2.get(i) % 2 != 0) {
                oddCount++;
            }
        }

        if (oddCount % 2 == 0) {
            return "YES";
        } else {
            return "NO";
        }
    }
}

This code works by first counting the number of odd numbers in both lst1 and lst2. If the total count of odd numbers is even, it's possible to convert all numbers in lst1 to even by exchanging odd numbers from lst2. If the total count of odd numbers is odd, it's not possible to convert all numbers in lst1 to even by exchanging odd numbers from lst2.
So, it checks if the total count of odd numbers in lst1 and lst2 is even, if it is it returns "YES" else "NO".

A: Yes, it is possible to convert all the odd numbers in lst1 to even by exchanging odd numbers from lst2.

B:
In the given problem, the task is to determine whether it is possible to perform an exchange of elements between two lists of numbers to make lst1 a list of only even numbers.
