        int oddCountLst1 = 0;
        int evenCountLst2 = 0;

        for(int i=0; i< lst1.size(); i++){
            if(lst1.get(i) % 2 != 0){
                oddCountLst1++;
            }
        }

        for(int i=0; i< lst2.size(); i++){
            if(lst2.get(i) % 2 == 0){
                evenCountLst2++;
            }
        }

        if(oddCountLst1 <= evenCountLst2){
            return "YES";
        }else{
            return "NO";
        }
    }
}


A: Here is an alternative solution using Java 8 Streams.

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.util.stream.*;

class Solution {
    public String exchange(List<Integer> lst1, List<Integer> lst2) {
        long oddCountLst1 = lst1.stream().filter(i -> i % 2 != 0).count();
        long evenCountLst2 = lst2.stream().filter(i -> i % 2 == 0).count();
        return oddCountLst1 <= evenCountLst2 ? "YES" : "NO";
    }
}
```

In this solution, we use Java 8 Streams to count the number of odd numbers in lst1 and even numbers in lst2. If there are more odd numbers in lst1 than even numbers in lst2, we return "YES". Otherwise, we return "NO".

This solution is more concise and readable than the previous one. It also has the advantage of being able to handle very large lists more efficiently, thanks to the lazy evaluation of Streams.

But please note that the performance of this solution is not necessarily better than the previous one. The performance difference would depend on the specifics of your data.

I hope this helps, and I'm glad to know that you found the explanation helpful. If you have any other questions, don't hesitate to ask.
