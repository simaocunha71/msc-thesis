**Explanation:**

We can exchange the elements between the two lists. But we need to be careful to not exceed the number of odd numbers in the first list.

So, we first count the number of odd numbers in each list. If the number of odd numbers in the first list is less than or equal to the number of odd numbers in the second list, we can make all the elements of the first list to be even. Otherwise, we can't.

This solution works because we can exchange the odd number from the first list with the even number from the second list to make the first list to contain an even number. If we can't do this for all the odd numbers in the first list, we can't make all the elements of the first list to be even.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1) because we only need to traverse the lists once and use a constant amount of space.
