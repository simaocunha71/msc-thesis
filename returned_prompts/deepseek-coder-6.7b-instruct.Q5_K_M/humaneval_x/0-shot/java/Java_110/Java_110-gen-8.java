        int odd1 = 0;
        int odd2 = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < lst1.size(); i++){
            if(lst1.get(i) % 2 != 0)
                odd1++;
            if(lst2.get(i) % 2 != 0)
                odd2++;
        }
        if(odd1 == odd2)
            return "YES";
        else
            return "NO";
    }
}

Explanation:
This function counts the number of odd numbers in both lst1 and lst2. If the number of odd numbers in both lists is equal, it means we can exchange elements from lst2 to make lst1 all even. If not, it means we cannot do so.

Here is a test case:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Solution s = new Solution();
    System.out.println(s.exchange(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4), Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4))); // "YES"
    System.out.println(s.exchange(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4), Arrays.asList(1, 5, 3, 4))); // "NO"
}
```

The output will be:
```
YES
NO
```

This is because in the first case, we can exchange the 1 from lst1 and 1 from lst2 to make all elements in lst1 even. In the second case, we cannot do so.

Time complexity is O(n) because we need to traverse both lists once. The space complexity is O(1) because we only use a fixed amount of space.
