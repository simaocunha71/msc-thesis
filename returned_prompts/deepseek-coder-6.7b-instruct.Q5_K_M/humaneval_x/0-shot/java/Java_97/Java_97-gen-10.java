        int a_lastDigit = Math.abs(a % 10);
        int b_lastDigit = Math.abs(b % 10);
        return a_lastDigit * b_lastDigit;
    }
}

This solution takes the absolute value of the modulo 10 of the input numbers, which gives the unit digit of the number. Then it returns the product of these last digits.

In the multiply method, the modulo operation returns the remainder of the division of the input number by 10, which is the last digit of the number. By using the Math.abs method to ensure that the last digit is always positive, we also handle the case where the input number is negative.

The final product of the last digits is then returned.

This solution is correct for the examples given and should work for any valid inputs.

The time complexity is O(1) as it performs a constant number of operations regardless of the size of the input. The space complexity is also O(1) as it uses a constant amount of space.

The function is case sensitive, so the method multiply(14,-15) returns 20, not 40.

The function works correctly for numbers with more than one digit as well. For example, multiply(148, 412) returns 16.

The function will not work correctly for numbers with more than one digit in the last place. For example, multiply(140, 410) will return 100 instead of 16.

The function does not work correctly for floating point numbers or numbers with decimal points. For example, multiply(14.8, 41.2) or multiply(14.8, 412) will not work correctly.

The function does not work correctly for numbers that are too large to be represented by an int. For example, multiply(2147483647, 2147483647) will not work correctly.

The function does not work correctly for negative numbers that are too large to be represented by an int. For example, multiply(-2147483648, -2147483648) will
