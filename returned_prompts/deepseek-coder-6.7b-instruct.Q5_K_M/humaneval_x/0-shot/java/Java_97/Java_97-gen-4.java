The solution here is to extract the last digit of both numbers by using the modulus operator, taking the absolute value of the number to handle negative numbers. Then we simply return the product of these two digits.
The main method is used to test the function with different inputs.
The multiply function is in the Solution class and is public, so it can be accessed from other classes.
