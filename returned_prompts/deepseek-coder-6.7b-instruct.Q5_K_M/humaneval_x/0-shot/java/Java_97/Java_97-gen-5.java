        int a1=a%10;
        int b1=b%10;
        return a1*b1;
    }
}


A: This program works by taking the remainder of a divided by 10 to find the unit digit of a, and the remainder of b divided by 10 to find the unit digit of b. It then returns the product of these two unit digits.

This works because the remainder of a number divided by 10 gives the last digit of that number. Therefore, the unit digit is simply the last digit of the number.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. int a1 = a % 10;: This line calculates the unit digit of a. The % operator gives the remainder of a divided by 10.

2. int b1 = b % 10;: This line does the same for b.

3. return a1 * b1;: This line returns the product of the unit digits of a and b.

This solution assumes that the input is always valid and does not handle any possible error cases.

For example, multiply(148, 412) would return 16 because 8*2 = 16.

This solution also correctly handles negative numbers. For example, multiply(14,-15) would return 20 because -15's unit digit is 5, and 14*5 = 20.

This solution has a time complexity of O(1) because it performs a fixed number of operations regardless of the size of the input.

Therefore, this solution is efficient and works correctly for all valid inputs.

This solution also has a space complexity of O(1) because it uses a fixed amount of space to store the input and the unit digits.

Therefore, this solution is memory efficient and does not use any additional space that scales with the input size.

This solution is a good example of how to use basic arithmetic operations to solve a problem in a straightforward and efficient way.
