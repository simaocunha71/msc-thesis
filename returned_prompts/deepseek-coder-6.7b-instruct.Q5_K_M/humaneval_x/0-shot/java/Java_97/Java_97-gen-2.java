        // Find the unit digit of each number by taking modulo 10
        int unitDigitA = Math.abs(a % 10);
        int unitDigitB = Math.abs(b % 10);

        // Return the product of the unit digits
        return unitDigitA * unitDigitB;
    }
}


A: The main logic of this problem is to find the last digits of the numbers. We can get the last digit of a number by taking modulo 10 of the number. In Java, '%' operator is used for finding the modulus. But, since the question states that the input will be always valid, we can directly use the modulo operator.

In case the number is negative, we can get the absolute value of the number by using Math.abs() method.

Finally, we multiply the unit digits of the numbers and return the result.

Your solution seems to be correct.

Here is your solution:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution  {
    public int multiply(int a, int b) {
        int unitDigitA = Math.abs(a % 10);
        int unitDigitB = Math.abs(b % 10);

        return unitDigitA * unitDigitB;
    }
}
```

The multiply() method takes two integers as input, finds the unit digits of these numbers, and returns the product of these unit digits.

The time complexity of this solution is O(1) since it performs constant number of operations. The space complexity is also O(1) since it uses constant amount of space.

Hope this helps.
