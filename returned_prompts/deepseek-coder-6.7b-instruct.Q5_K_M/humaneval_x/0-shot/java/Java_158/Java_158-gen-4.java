A: The code you provided is correct and it should work as expected.
It iterates over the list of words and for each word, it creates a hash set that stores unique characters from the word. It then compares the size of this set with the maximum count found so far. If the size of the set is greater, it updates the maximum count and the result string. If the size of the set is equal to the maximum count, it compares the result string with the current word and updates the result string if the current word comes lexicographically first.
Finally, it returns the result string which is the word with the maximum number of unique characters.

A: It seems like you have done a good job with the code.
You are correct in using a HashSet to store the unique characters in each word. Then, you are comparing the size of this HashSet with the maximum count found so far, and updating the maximum count and result string if necessary.
In the case of a tie (when the size of the HashSet
