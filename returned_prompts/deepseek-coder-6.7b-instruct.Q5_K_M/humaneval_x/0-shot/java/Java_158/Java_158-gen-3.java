A: The solution you've posted is correct. It iterates over every word in the list, counts the unique characters in it, and keeps track of the word with the maximum number of unique characters. If there are multiple words with the maximum number of unique characters, it keeps the one that comes first in lexicographical order.

Here's a bit more explanation of the code:

- It initializes maxWord as an empty string and maxUnique as 0.
- It then iterates over each word in the list.
- For each word, it creates a Set of unique characters by iterating over the characters in the word.
- If the size of the Set (i.e., the number of unique characters in the word) is greater than maxUnique, or if the size is the same but the word is lexicographically smaller than maxWord, then it updates maxUnique and maxWord.
- Finally, it returns maxWord, which is the word with the maximum number of unique characters.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n*m) where n is the number of words and m is the average length of the words. The space complexity is O(n*m) as well, due to the storage of the Set for each word.

I hope this helps clarify the solution to your problem. Let me know if you have any other questions.


A: Here is the implementation of the problem.

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public String findMax(List<String> words) {
        String maxWord = "";
        int maxUnique = 0;
        
        for (String word
