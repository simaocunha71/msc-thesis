        return l.stream().filter(i -> i > 0).collect(Collectors.toList());

A: The code you posted is correct. It uses Java 8 Stream API to filter out the positive numbers from the list.
Here is the brief explanation of the code:


*

*The getPositive method takes a List of Integers as input.

*The stream() method converts the list to a Stream.

*The filter() method filters out the numbers which are not positive. It checks each number in the stream if it's greater than 0.

*The collect() method collects the results to a new list.


So, the output of your getPositive method will be a list of only positive numbers from the input list.
