        return l.stream().filter(x -> x > 0).collect(Collectors.toList());
    }
}


A: The question asks to filter out the negative numbers from the list and return only the positive ones. This is achieved by using the Java 8 Stream API to filter out the numbers which are less than or equal to zero.

The solution given by you is correct. It uses Java 8's Stream API to filter out the negative numbers. The stream() function is used to convert the list into a Stream. Then, the filter() function is used to filter out the numbers which are less than or equal to zero. Finally, the collect() function is used to convert the Stream back into a List.

So, your solution is correct.

A: The given solution is correct and it uses Java 8 Stream API to solve the problem. The filter function is used to filter out the negative numbers. The numbers that are greater than 0 are collected into a list. 

Here is the solution in detail:

Stream<Integer> stream = l.stream();

Here, we are converting the list into a Stream.

stream.filter(x -> x > 0);

Here, we are filtering out the negative numbers. The condition x -> x > 0 is a lambda expression which checks if the number is greater than 0.

stream.filter(x -> x > 0).collect(Collectors.toList());

Here, we are collecting the filtered numbers into a list.

So, the entire function is returning the list of positive numbers from the given list.
