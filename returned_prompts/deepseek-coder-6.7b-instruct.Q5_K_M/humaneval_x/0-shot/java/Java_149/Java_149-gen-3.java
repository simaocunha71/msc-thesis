In this code, the listSort method accepts a list of strings as a parameter. It then iterates through the list, and if the length of a string is even, it adds it to a new list. After that, it sorts the new list by length of each string and alphabetically for the same length strings.

The compare method in the Comparator checks if the lengths of two strings are equal. If they are, it uses the compareTo method to compare the strings alphabetically. If not, it returns the difference between the lengths of the strings.

The sorted list is then returned.

The main method tests the listSort method with two example lists. The output of the program is the sorted list of strings.

The time complexity of this code is O(n log n) because of the sorting operation. The space complexity is O(n) because we are creating a new list to store the strings with even lengths.

This code assumes that all strings in the input list have the same length and that the input
