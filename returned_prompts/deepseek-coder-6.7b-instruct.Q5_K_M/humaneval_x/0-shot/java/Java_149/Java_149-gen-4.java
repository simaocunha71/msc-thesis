        List<String> result = new ArrayList<String>();

                    return s1.length() - s2.length();
                else
                    return s1.compareTo(s2);

A: Here is an improved version of the code which uses Java 8's lambda expressions:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.util.stream.*;

class Solution {

    public List<String> listSort(List<String> lst) {
        return lst.stream()
                  .filter(s -> s.length() % 2 == 0)
                  .sorted(Comparator.comparing(String::length).thenComparing(String::compareTo))
                  .collect(Collectors.toList());
    }
}
```

This version does the same as the previous one, but in a more concise and functional way. It uses the Java Stream API to filter out the strings with odd lengths, then sorts them according to the length and alphabetical order, and finally collects them into a list. The `Comparator.comparing(String::length)` and `String::compareTo` methods are lambda expressions that refer to the `length` and `compareTo` methods of the `String` class respectively.

This version is more readable and easier to maintain, as it does not require explicit loops or conditionals. It also has better performance, as it avoids the overhead of creating extra lists and sorting them.

It's important to note that while this version is more concise, it might be harder to understand for beginners. If you're looking for a version that's easier to understand, you can stick with the previous version.
