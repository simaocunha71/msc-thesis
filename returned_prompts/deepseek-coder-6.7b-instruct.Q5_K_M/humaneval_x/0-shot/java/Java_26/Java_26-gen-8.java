        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        Map<Integer, Long> counts = numbers.stream()
            .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Function.identity(), Collectors.counting()));
        for (Integer number : numbers) {
            if (counts.get(number) == 1) {
                result.add(number);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}

Explanation:
This solution uses a combination of Java 8 Streams and Collectors to count occurrences of each integer. Then it iterates through the original list again and adds each integer to the result if it only occurs once. This preserves the order of elements as in the original list.

The time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of elements in the list, because we do two passes over the list. The space complexity is also O(n) because we store counts of all elements in a map.

The function is tested with the following code:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Solution s = new Solution();
    System.out.println(s.removeDuplicates(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 2, 4)));  // prints [1, 3, 4]
}
```

This will print [1, 3, 4] as expected.

If you have any questions or need further clarification, please let me know.


A: Yes, the solution is correct. But, it would be more efficient if you use a single pass over the list. You can use a HashMap to count the occurrences of each integer. If the count is 1, add it to the result list, and if the count is more than 1, remove it from the list. Here is an optimized version of the solution:

```java
public List<Integer> removeDuplicates(List<Integer> numbers) {
    List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
    Map<Integer, Integer> counts = new HashMap<>();
    for (Integer number : numbers) {
        counts.put(number, counts.getOrDefault(number, 0) + 1);
    }
    for (Integer number : numbers) {
