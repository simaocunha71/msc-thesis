        Map<Integer, Long> counts = numbers.stream()
            .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Function.identity(), Collectors.counting()));

        return numbers.stream()
            .filter(n -> counts.get(n) == 1)
            .collect(Collectors.toList());
    }
}


A: Here is the corrected code:

import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

class Solution {
    /**
    From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.
    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.
    >>> removeDuplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])
    [1, 3, 4]
    */
    public List<Integer> removeDuplicates(List<Integer> numbers) {

        Map<Integer, Long> counts = numbers.stream()
            .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Function.identity(), Collectors.counting()));

        return numbers.stream()
            .filter(n -> counts.get(n) == 1)
            .collect(Collectors.toList());
    }
}

This code uses Java 8's streams API to count the occurrences of each number in the list, and then filters the original list to only keep numbers that occur exactly once. The result is a list with all duplicates removed, in the same order as the original list.

A: The original question had a typo where it mentioned "Array.asList(1, 2, 3, 2, 4)" but the correct way to create a list in Java is "Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 2, 4)". Here's the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

class Solution {
    /**
    From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.
    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.
    >>> removeDuplicates(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 2, 4
