        Map<Integer, Long> counts = numbers.stream()
                .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Function.identity(), Collectors.counting()));

        List<Integer> result = numbers.stream()
                .filter(n -> counts.get(n) == 1)
                .collect(Collectors.toList());

        return result;
    }
}


A: Here is the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

class Solution  {
    public List<Integer> removeDuplicates(List<Integer> numbers) {
        Map<Integer, Long> counts = numbers.stream()
                .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Function.identity(), Collectors.counting()));

        List<Integer> result = numbers.stream()
                .filter(n -> counts.get(n) == 1)
                .collect(Collectors.toList());

        return result;
    }
}
```

The function `removeDuplicates(List<Integer> numbers)` works by first creating a map `counts` that holds the count of each integer in the list `numbers`. Then, it creates a new list `result` by filtering the original list `numbers` and keeping only the integers that have a count of 1 (i.e., they occur only once in the list). The function then returns this `result` list.

This solution uses Java 8's Stream API, which provides a more concise way to perform operations on collections.

Please note that this solution assumes that the input list does not contain null elements. If there could be null elements in the list, you would need to add a null check in the `counts` calculation.

Also, please note that this solution does not preserve the original order of elements in the list. If you need to preserve the original order, you would need to use a different approach, like using a LinkedHashMap to keep track of the count and the order of elements.

Here is the modified version of the code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

class Solution  {
    public
