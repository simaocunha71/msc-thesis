I:


*

*Splits the string x and n into the numerator and denominator.

*Converts these to integers.

*Calculates the new numerator and denominator for the simplified fraction (x * n).

*Checks if the new numerator is evenly divisible by the new denominator. If it is, it returns true, otherwise it returns false.


R:
This solution works by first breaking the fractions into their numerator and denominator parts. It then converts these parts into integers and calculates the new numerator and denominator for the simplified fraction (x * n). It then checks if the new numerator is evenly divisible by the new denominator. If it is, it returns true, indicating that the expression x * n evaluates to a whole number. If the new numerator is not evenly divisible by the new denominator, it returns false.

This solution assumes that the input strings are valid fractions and that they do not have zero as the denominator.

The time complexity of this solution is O(1), as it performs a constant number of operations regardless of the input size. The space complexity is also O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the numerator and denominator parts of the fractions and the final numerator and denominator of the simplified fraction.

It's worth noting that this solution could be optimized by eliminating the need for the numFinal and denFinal variables and directly returning the result of the modulo operation.

This solution could be further improved by adding input validation to ensure that the input strings are valid fractions and that they
