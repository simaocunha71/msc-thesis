This solution works by first splitting the input strings into numerator and denominator parts. It then converts these parts from strings to integers. After that, it calculates the product of the numerators and the product of the denominators and checks if these products are equal. If they are, the function returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

This solution assumes that the input strings are always valid fractions and do not have zero as a denominator. If this is not the case, the function should be modified to handle invalid inputs.

This solution uses the Java built-in `split` method to split the strings into numerator and denominator parts, and the `parseInt` method to convert the parts from strings to integers. It then calculates the product of the numerators and the product of the denominators and checks if these products are equal. If they are equal, the function returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

This solution has a time complexity of O(1) because it performs a constant number of operations regardless of the size of the input. It has a space complexity of O(1) because it uses a constant amount of space to store the numerator and denominator parts of the input strings and the products of the numerators and denominators.
