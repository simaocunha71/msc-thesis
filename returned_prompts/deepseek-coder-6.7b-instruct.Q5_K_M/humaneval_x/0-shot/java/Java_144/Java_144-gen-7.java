The function works by first splitting the input strings into numerators and denominators. It then converts these strings into integers. The product of the numerators is then calculated and the greatest common divisor (gcd) of this product and the product of the denominators is calculated. If the product is a whole number (i.e., the product is divisible by the gcd), the function returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

The gcd is calculated using the Euclidean algorithm, which is a recursive method for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers. The base case of this recursion is when the second number is 0, in which case the first number is the gcd. Otherwise, the gcd is calculated recursively by calling the gcd function with the second number and the remainder of the first number divided by the second number.

The time complexity of this function is O(log min(a, b)), where a and b are the numbers for which the gcd is being calculated. This is because the gcd function uses the Euclidean algorithm, which has a complexity of O(log min(a, b)). The space complexity is O(1), as no additional space is used that scales
