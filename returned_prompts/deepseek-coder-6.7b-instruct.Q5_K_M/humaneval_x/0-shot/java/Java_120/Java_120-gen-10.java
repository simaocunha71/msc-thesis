        PriorityQueue<Integer> heap = new PriorityQueue<Integer>(Collections.reverseOrder());
        heap.addAll(arr);
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        for(int i=0; i<k; i++){
            result.add(heap.poll());
        }
        Collections.sort(result);
        return result;
    }
}

This solution uses a priority queue to store the maximum k numbers. It then polls the heap k times and adds them to the result list. This list is then sorted and returned.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) as the priority queue operations are log n and it is performed n times. The space complexity is O(n) as the priority queue and result list can store up to n elements.

In the given examples, the function maximum is called with the following arguments:

maximum([-3, -4, 5], 3) // returns [-4, -3, 5]
maximum([4, -4, 4], 2) // returns [4, 4]
maximum([-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1], 1) // returns [2]

These examples correctly compute the maximum k numbers from the input array and return them in a sorted list.

The given problem is about finding the maximum k numbers from an array and returning them in a sorted list. The solution uses a priority queue to store the maximum k numbers and then polls them out. The results are stored in a list and returned. The time complexity is O(n log n) and the space complexity is O(n).
