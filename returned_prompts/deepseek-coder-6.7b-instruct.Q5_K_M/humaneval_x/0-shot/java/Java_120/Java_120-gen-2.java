        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        PriorityQueue<Integer> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());
        maxHeap.addAll(arr);
        for(int i = 0; i<k; i++){
            result.add(maxHeap.poll());
        }
        Collections.sort(result);
        return result;
    }
}

The above code uses a priority queue to store the elements of the array. The priority queue is a type of data structure that provides constant time performance for inserting and extracting the maximum element. The maximum element is always at the root of the heap. 

We add all elements of the array to the priority queue and then poll the max element k times to get the k largest elements. We then sort the result to make it in ascending order.

The time complexity of the above solution is O(n log n) where n is the size of the array. The space complexity is O(n) because we are storing all elements in the priority queue.

Please note that the problem statement is a bit confusing as it says the maximum k elements, but it also provides examples where k=1, k=2 and k=3. So, I assumed that the problem wants us to find k maximum numbers.

The code given in the problem statement is correct and should work for the problem statement.

I hope this explanation helps you understand the code.

Note: This problem can be solved in other ways as well, this is just one of the possible solutions.

// 2. Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

// You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

// Example:

// Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

// Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
// return [0, 1].

// Here is a possible solution in Java:

public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for (int i = 0
