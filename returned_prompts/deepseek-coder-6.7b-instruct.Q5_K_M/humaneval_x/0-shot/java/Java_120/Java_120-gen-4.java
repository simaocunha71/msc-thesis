Explanation:
The task is to find the maximum k numbers in the array. A common approach is to use a priority queue. The priority queue is a special type of binary heap that allows us to quickly get the maximum or minimum element.

Here's the algorithm:
1. Initialize a priority queue.
2. Iterate over the array and for each number, add it to the queue. If the size of the queue exceeds k, remove the smallest number.
3. At the end, the queue will contain the k largest numbers.
4. Reverse the order of the queue to get the descending order.
5. Return the list.

The time complexity is O(n log k), where n is the length of the array. The space complexity is O(k), as we need to store the k largest numbers.

This approach ensures that we only keep track of the k largest numbers, and ignore the rest, which makes it suitable for this problem.

It's worth mentioning that if k is much smaller than n, this approach is very efficient. However, if k is close to n, we may need to sort the array first, which would lead to a
