A: This function works by first splitting the input string into words. Then it iterates through each word, converts it to a character array, sorts the characters in the array based on their ASCII values, and then appends the sorted characters to the result string. Finally, it removes the trailing space from the result string before returning it.

For example, if the input is "Hello World!!!", the function will first split the string into the words "Hello" and "World!!!". Then it will sort the characters in each word and append them to the result string. The result string will be "Hello !!!Wdlor".

Note that this function preserves the original order of the words in the sentence, as requested. Also, the function treats punctuation as part of the word, so "Hello" and "Hello!!!" are considered different words.

If you want to treat punctuation as separate characters, you will need to modify the function to handle that case.

Here is the function again for reference:

```java
public String antiShuffle(String s) {
    String[] words = s.split(" ");
    StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();

    for (String word : words) {
        char[] chars = word.toCharArray();
        Arrays.sort(chars);
        result.append(new String(chars)).append(" ");
    }

    if (result.length() > 0) {
        result.setLength(result.length() - 1);
    }

    return result
