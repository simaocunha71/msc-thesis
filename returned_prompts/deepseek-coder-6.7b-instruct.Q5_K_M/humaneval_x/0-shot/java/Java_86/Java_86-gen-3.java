        String[] words = s.split(" ");
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (String word : words) {
            char[] chars = word.toCharArray();
            Arrays.sort(chars);
            sb.append(new String(chars)).append(" ");
        }
        return sb.toString().trim();
    }
}

This solution works by first splitting the input string into words. Then, for each word, it converts it to a character array, sorts the characters, and appends the sorted characters (as a string) to a StringBuilder. It then returns the result string, trimmed to remove trailing whitespace.

Here's an explanation of the code:

- The function antiShuffle takes a string s as an argument.
- The string s is split into words using the split() method, which splits the string at each space character. The result is an array of words.
- A StringBuilder sb is created to hold the sorted words.
- A for-each loop is used to iterate over each word in the words array.
- For each word, the toCharArray() method is used to convert the word into an array of characters.
- The Arrays.sort() method is used to sort the characters in ascending order based on their ASCII values.
- The sorted characters are then appended to the StringBuilder sb, followed by a space.
- After all words have been processed, the toString() method is used to convert the StringBuilder sb back to a string.
- The trim() method is used to remove any trailing whitespace from the result string.
- The result string is then returned.

This solution assumes that words are separated by spaces and that punctuation is considered part of the preceding word.

Please note that this solution is case sensitive. If you want it to be case insensitive, you could convert the input string to lower case before splitting it into words.
