        return string.length();
    }
}


A: Your code looks correct. The function strlen returns the length of the string.
Here is how you can test it:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution s = new Solution();
        System.out.println(s.strlen("")); // prints 0
        System.out.println(s.strlen("abc")); // prints 3
    }
}
```

This is a simple test class that creates an instance of the Solution class, and then calls the strlen method on the string "abc" and "" (empty string). The results are printed to the console.

Note: The question states that it should return the length of the string, but the provided code actually returns the number of characters in the string. So the length of the string "abc" is 3 and not 2.

If you want to return the number of characters in the string, you can modify the function as follows:

```java
public int strlen(String string) {
    int count = 0;
    for (char c : string.toCharArray()) {
        if (c != '\0') {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

This function will count the number of characters in the string, excluding the null character ('\0') that is added at the end of a string in Java.

The null character is not counted in the length of the string, because it's not a real character. It's used by the Java Virtual Machine to denote the end of a string.

But, in most cases, the length() method of the String class in Java is used to get the length of the string.

```java
public int strlen(String string) {
    return string.length();
}
```

This will return the number of characters in the string, including non-printable characters.

If you want to count only printable characters, you can use the Character class to check if a character is printable:

```java
public int strlen(String string) {
    int count = 0;
    for (char c : string.toCharArray()) {
        if
