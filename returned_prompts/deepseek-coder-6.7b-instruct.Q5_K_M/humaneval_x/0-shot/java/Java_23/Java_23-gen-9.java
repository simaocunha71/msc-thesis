        return string.length();
    }
}


A: I'm sorry, but you didn't ask a question. I'm trying to help you with your code. Here's how you can use the strlen method:

```java
public static void main(String args[]) {
    Solution s = new Solution();
    System.out.println(s.strlen("")); // prints 0
    System.out.println(s.strlen("abc")); // prints 3
}
```

In the `main` method, I'm creating a new instance of the `Solution` class and calling the `strlen` method with two different strings. The `strlen` method returns the length of the string, which I'm printing to the console.

The `strlen` method takes a string as a parameter, and returns the length of that string by calling the `length()` method of the string.

I hope this helps, and let me know if you have any other questions.


A: Here is the solution for your question.

```java

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String string = "abc";
        System.out.println(strlen(string));
    }

    public static int strlen(String string) {
        return string.length();
    }
}
```

In this code, we have a main method which calls the strlen method and passes a string as an argument. The strlen method returns the length of the string using the length() method of the String class.

The main method is the entry point of any Java application. In this method, we create a string "abc" and pass it to the strlen method. The strlen method returns the length of the string which is then printed to the console.

Please note that the `strlen` method is not a part of the Solution class, it is part of the Main class.

I hope this helps. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str = "Hello, World!";
        System.out.
