            if(i % 2 != 0 && lst.get(i) % 2 == 0) {
                sum += lst.get(i);

This code loops through the list and checks if the index is odd and the value at that index is even. If it is, the value is added to the sum.

This code assumes that the list index starts at 0, which is common in many programming languages. If the list index starts at 1, the code would need to be adjusted slightly.
