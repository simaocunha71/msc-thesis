        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < lst.size(); i += 2) {
            if (lst.get(i) % 2 == 0) {
                sum += lst.get(i);
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}


A: This is correct. It iterates over the list starting at index 1 (since we count from 0, 1 is the second element), and adds every second element to the sum if it is even.

A: It seems like your code is correct. But there's a minor thing. You are starting the loop from index 1, which means you are ignoring the first element in the list. If you want to consider the first element as well, just change the loop condition to "i < lst.size()".
