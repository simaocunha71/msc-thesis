        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < lst.size(); i += 2) {
            if (lst.get(i) % 2 == 0) {
                sum += lst.get(i);
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}

Explanation:
The function `add` takes a list of integers as input. We initialize a variable `sum` to 0. We then iterate through the list using a for loop, with the condition that we only consider elements at odd indices. In the loop, we check if the element at the current index is even. If it is, we add it to `sum`. Finally, we return `sum`.

This function will sum all the even elements at odd indices in the list. For example, in the list `[4, 2, 6, 7]`, the elements at odd indices are 2 and 6. Both of them are even, so the function returns 2 + 6 = 8.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the list. This is because we must iterate through all the elements in the list. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the sum and the indices.

I hope this helps to understand the problem and solution better.
