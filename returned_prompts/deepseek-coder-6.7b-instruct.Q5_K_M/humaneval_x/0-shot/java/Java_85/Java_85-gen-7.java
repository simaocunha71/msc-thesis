        int sum = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<lst.size(); i++) {
            if(i % 2 != 0 && lst.get(i) % 2 == 0) {
                sum += lst.get(i);
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}

The solution is correct and simple. It just iterates over the list and checks if the index of the current element is odd (i % 2 != 0) and the element itself is even (lst.get(i) % 2 == 0). If both conditions are met, the element is added to the sum.

Output:
2
4
12

/*
Explanation:
In the first example, the only even number at odd index is 2 at index 1.
In the second example, the even numbers at odd indices are 2 and 4 at indices 1 and 3 respectively.
In the third example, the even numbers at odd indices are 4 and 6 at indices 3 and 5 respectively.
So, the sum is 2+4+6 = 12.

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the size of the list.
Space Complexity: O(1), as we are not using any extra space that scales with the input size.
