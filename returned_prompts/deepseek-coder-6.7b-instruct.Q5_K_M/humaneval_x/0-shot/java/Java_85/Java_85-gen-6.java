            if(lst.get(i) % 2 == 0){
                sum += lst.get(i);

A: This is the correct solution to the problem. The code takes the list, iterates over it starting from the 1st index (which is an odd index), and checks if the integer is even. If it is, it adds it to the sum, which is then returned as the result.

A: The problem can be solved using simple iteration over the list. In Java, you can use the modulo operator to check if a number is even. If the number at index i in the list is even, then add it to a running total.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    public int add(List<Integer> lst) {
        int sum = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<lst.size(); i++){
            if(lst.get(i) % 2 == 0 && i % 2 != 0){
                sum += lst.get(i);
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

In this corrected code, I also fixed the condition of checking even elements at odd indices. Now, the code checks if the element at the current index is even and if the index is odd. If both conditions are met, then the element is added to the sum.

This code will return the sum of all even elements in the list that are at odd indices.

I hope this helps.

A: The problem requires you to add the even numbers at odd indices of the list. This can be solved by iterating over the list and adding the even numbers at odd indices to a running total. Here is the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    public int add(List<Integer> lst) {
        int sum = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<lst.size(); i++){
            if
