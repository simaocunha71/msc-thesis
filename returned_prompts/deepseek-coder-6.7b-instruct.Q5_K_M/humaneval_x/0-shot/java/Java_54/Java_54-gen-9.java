        // convert strings to character arrays
        char[] c0 = s0.toCharArray();
        char[] c1 = s1.toCharArray();

        // sort both arrays
        Arrays.sort(c0);
        Arrays.sort(c1);

        // compare sorted arrays
        return Arrays.equals(c0, c1);
    }
}

This code works by first converting the strings to character arrays, then sorting these arrays, and finally comparing the sorted arrays. If the arrays are equal (that is, if the two strings contain exactly the same characters in the same quantities), the method will return true. Otherwise, it will return false.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting of the character arrays, where n is the length of the strings.

It also has a space complexity of O(n) because the character arrays are the main data structure used to store the strings.

Note: The sorting step is necessary because we want to compare the characters in the strings in sorted order, rather than the original order. This ensures that "sameChars("abcd", "dddddddabc")" will return true, rather than false, even though the characters in the strings are not in the same order.
