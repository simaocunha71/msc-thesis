        // convert strings to char arrays
        char[] s0_array = s0.toCharArray();
        char[] s1_array = s1.toCharArray();

        // sort the char arrays
        Arrays.sort(s0_array);
        Arrays.sort(s1_array);

        // convert char arrays back to strings
        String sorted_s0 = new String(s0_array);
        String sorted_s1 = new String(s1_array);

        // check if sorted strings are equal
        return sorted_s0.equals(sorted_s1);
    }
}

The code creates two char arrays from the input strings. It then sorts these arrays and converts them back into strings. Finally, it checks if these sorted strings are equal. The result is a boolean indicating whether or not the input strings contain the same characters.

Note: This code assumes that case matters (i.e., 'a' is considered different from 'A'). If you want to ignore case, you can convert the strings to lower or upper case before sorting them.

This code also assumes that spaces, punctuation, and other non-letter characters do not matter. If you want to ignore these, you can remove them before sorting the strings.

The time complexity of this code is O(nlogn), where n is the length of the strings. This is because the sorting operation dominates the runtime. The space complexity is O(n), because we are creating new char arrays for the strings.

This code could be further optimized by using a frequency count instead of sorting, which would have a time complexity of O(n).
