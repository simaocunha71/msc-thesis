        // Initialize two hashmaps to store the count of each character in s0 and s1
        Map<Character, Integer> map1 = new HashMap<>();
        Map<Character, Integer> map2 = new HashMap<>();

        // Iterate over the characters in s0 and s1 respectively
        for (int i = 0; i < s0.length(); i++) {
            char c = s0.charAt(i);
            map1.put(c, map1.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < s1.length(); i++) {
            char c = s1.charAt(i);
            map2.put(c, map2.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
        }

        // Check if the hashmaps are equal
        return map1.equals(map2);
    }
}

This solution works by using a hashmap to store the count of each character in the two strings, and then checking if the two hashmaps are equal.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the longer string. This is because we iterate over each character in both strings once.

The space complexity is also O(n), as we store the count of each character in both strings in a hashmap.

This solution assumes that the strings are case-sensitive (i.e., 'a' and 'A' are considered different characters). If you want to ignore case, you can convert both strings to lower or upper case before processing them.

The solution also assumes that the strings can contain any characters, not just lowercase letters. If you want to restrict the solution to only letters, you can add a check to only count and compare the characters in the strings that are letters.

This solution assumes that the strings can contain duplicate characters, not just unique ones. If you want to restrict the solution to only unique characters, you can modify the solution to only count and compare the unique characters in the strings.

A: Your code is almost correct, but the logic of sorting is wrong. In your code, you're sorting both strings which is not necessary. 
Instead, you should sort just one string and then check
