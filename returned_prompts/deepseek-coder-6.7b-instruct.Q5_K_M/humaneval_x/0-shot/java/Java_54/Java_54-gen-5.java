    This line checks if the lengths of the two strings are equal. If they are not, it returns false. This is because if the lengths are not equal, it is guaranteed that they cannot have the same characters, so we return false immediately.

B:
    This line converts the strings into character arrays.

C:
    This line sorts the character arrays.

D:
    This line checks if the sorted character arrays are equal. If they are, it means that the strings have the same characters, so it returns true. If they are not equal, it means that the strings do not have the same characters, so it returns false.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) because of the sorting. The space complexity is O(n) because of the character arrays.
