        char[] s0Chars = s0.toCharArray();
        char[] s1Chars = s1.toCharArray();
        Arrays.sort(s0Chars);
        Arrays.sort(s1Chars);
        return Arrays.equals(s0Chars, s1Chars);
    }
}


A: You can use a HashMap to count the occurrences of each character in both strings. Then, for each character in the first string, you decrease its count in the HashMap. For each character in the second string, you increase its count in the HashMap. 

In the end, if all counts in the HashMap are zero, it means that both strings have the same characters. 

Here is the Java code:
class Solution {
    public boolean sameChars(String s0, String s1) {
        Map<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

        for (char c : s0.toCharArray()) {
            map.put(c, map.getOrDefault(c, 0) - 1);
        }

        for (char c : s1.toCharArray()) {
            map.put(c, map.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
        }

        return map.values().stream().allMatch(count -> count == 0);
    }
}


A: The problem is that you're not considering the quantity of each character in the strings.
The toCharArray() method returns an array of characters from the given string.
The Arrays.sort() method sorts the specified array of objects into ascending numerical order.
The Arrays.equals() method returns true if the two specified arrays are equal to one another.

What you need to do is count the occurrence of each character in both strings and compare if they are the same. Here is an example of how to do this:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public boolean sameChars(String s0, String s1) {
        Map<Character, Integer> countS0 = new HashMap<>();
        Map<Character, Integer> countS1 = new HashMap<>();

        for (char c : s0
