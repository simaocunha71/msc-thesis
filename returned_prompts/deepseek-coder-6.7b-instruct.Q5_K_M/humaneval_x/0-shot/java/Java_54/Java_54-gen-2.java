        char[] s0Chars = s0.toCharArray();
        char[] s1Chars = s1.toCharArray();

        Arrays.sort(s0Chars);
        Arrays.sort(s1Chars);

        return Arrays.equals(s0Chars, s1Chars);
    }
}

This solution works by converting the strings to character arrays, sorting them, and then checking if the sorted arrays are equal. If they are, the strings contain the same characters.

Note: This solution assumes that the case of characters is significant (i.e., 'a' is different from 'A'). If it's not the case, we can convert all characters to lowercase or uppercase before sorting and comparing.
Also, it assumes that order of characters is not important. If order is important, we would need a different approach, such as counting the occurrences of each character in both strings and making sure the counts are the same for each character.

// --------------
// This is a Java program that determines if two words contain the same characters.
// The program takes two strings as input and returns true if they contain the same characters, otherwise false.
// It does this by sorting the characters in each string and comparing the sorted strings.
// If the sorted strings are equal, the original strings contain the same characters.
