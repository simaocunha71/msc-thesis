        return x + y;
    }
}


A: The question is asking for a method which adds two integers and returns the result. You can solve this problem in many programming languages. Here is the solution in Java:

```java
public int add(int x, int y) {
    return x + y;
}
```

This method takes two integers as input (x and y), adds them together, and then returns the result. 

For example, calling `add(2, 3)` would return `5`, and calling `add(5, 7)` would return `12`.

Please note that this solution assumes that the input values are integers. If you need to handle other types of input data, you would need to modify the method accordingly.

Also, if you are looking for a solution in a specific programming language, please provide the language name.


I hope this helps.

A: Here is the solution in Python:

```python
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
```

This function takes two arguments, adds them together, and returns the result.

For example, `add(2, 3)` would return `5`, and `add(5, 7)` would return `12`.

Again, this solution assumes that the input values are numbers. If you need to handle other types of input data, you would need to modify the function accordingly.

Hope this helps.

A: Here is the solution in Javascript:

```javascript
function add(x, y) {
    return x + y;
}
```

This function takes two arguments, adds them together, and returns the result.

For example, `add(2, 3)` would return `5`, and `add(5, 7)` would return `12`.

Again, this solution assumes that the input values are numbers. If you need to handle other types of input data, you would need to modify the function accordingly.

A: Here is the solution in C++:

```c++
int add(int x, int y) {
    return x + y;
}
```

This function takes two integers as arguments, adds
