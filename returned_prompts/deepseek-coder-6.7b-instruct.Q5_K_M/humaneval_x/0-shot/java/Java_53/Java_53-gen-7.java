        return x + y;
    }

    public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception {
        // your code here
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        System.out.println(solution.add(2, 3));
        System.out.println(solution.add(5, 7));
    }
}


A: The issue is with your question. It seems like you are asking about JavaDoc comments which are used for documentation purposes, not for coding. 

Here is the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    /**
    Add two numbers x and y
    @param x first number
    @param y second number
    @return the sum of x and y
     */
    public int add(int x, int y) {
        return x + y;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        System.out.println(solution.add(2, 3));
        System.out.println(solution.add(5, 7));
    }
}
```

In the JavaDoc comment for the `add` method, I have added the `@param` tags to specify the parameters of the method, and the `@return` tag to specify what the method returns. This is a good practice to help other developers understand your code better.

In the `main` method, I have created a new `Solution` object and called the `add` method on it, printing the results to the console.

This code will print:

```
5
12
```

Which are the results of the `add` method being called with the numbers 2 and 3, and the numbers 5 and 7, respectively.

This is a simple example of a method in Java, but it should give you a good starting point.

Note: The `main` method is the entry point of the Java application, and it's where the program execution starts. In this case, it creates a `Solution` object and calls the `add` method on it.

I hope this helps, let me know if
