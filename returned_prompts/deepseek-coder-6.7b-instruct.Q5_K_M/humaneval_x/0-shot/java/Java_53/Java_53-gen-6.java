    return x+y;
    }
    
}


A: The code you provided is already correct. It defines a method add() which takes two integers as parameters and returns their sum. Here's the code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    public int add(int x, int y) {
        return x + y;
    }
}
```

If you run this code, you will get the results as you described, e.g. add(2, 3) will return 5 and add(5, 7) will return 12.

But, if you meant to ask about a different problem or question, please provide the details.

Note: The comments in the code are not meant to be Java documentation comments. They are just comments in the code to provide context and help understanding the code. They are not meant to be run as code.

A: 
    return x+y;
}

This is the correct answer. This line of code returns the sum of x and y.
