        return x+y;
    }

    public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception {
        System.out.println(new Solution().add(2, 3));
        System.out.println(new Solution().add(5, 7));
    }
}

The question is to add two numbers x and y. The given code does that perfectly. In the main function, new Solution().add(2, 3) is called which returns the sum of 2 and 3 which is 5. Similarly, new Solution().add(5, 7) returns the sum of 5 and 7 which is 12.

So, the code does exactly what the question asks for, and does not need any modifications.

// Solution:

class Solution {
    public int add(int x, int y) {
        return x + y;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        System.out.println(solution.add(2, 3)); // 5
        System.out.println(solution.add(5, 7)); // 12
    }
}

// Alternate Solution:

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(add(2, 3)); // 5
        System.out.println(add(5, 7)); // 12
    }
    
    public static int add(int x, int y) {
        return x + y;
    }
}

/*
Both solutions are valid and do the same thing. The first one separates the logic of the problem from the main method, making it easier to read and understand. The second one keeps everything in the main method, but it's a bit more concise.
