        String binary = Integer.toBinaryString(decimal);
        binary = "db" + binary + "db";
        return binary;
    }
}


A: You can use Java's built-in Integer.toBinaryString() method to convert decimal to binary.
This method returns a String that represents the binary value of the given decimal number.

The code snippet you provided is correct. Here is how it works:


*

*The Integer.toBinaryString(decimal) returns a String that represents the binary value of the decimal.

*The "db" + binary + "db" is then concatenated to the binary value to add the "db" characters at the start and end of the binary string.

*The binary String is then returned by the method.


This code will work correctly for any valid decimal input, and will return a String in binary format with the "db" characters at the start and end.

A: The code you have written is correct, and it should work as expected. It converts the decimal number to binary and then adds the "db" at the beginning and end of the binary string.
Here is how you can test it:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        System.out.println(solution.decimalToBinary(15));  // Outputs: "db1111db"
        System.out.println(solution.decimalToBinary(32));  // Outputs: "db100000db"
    }
}
```

This will test the `decimalToBinary` method with the numbers 15 and 32. The output should be the binary representations of these numbers with the "db" characters added at the beginning and end.

Please make sure that you have the correct imports at the beginning of your code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;
```

These are the imports that you need for this code to work correctly.

Hope this helps, and let me know if you have any more questions.

A: The given code is correct and it will work as expected. It converts the given decimal number to binary
