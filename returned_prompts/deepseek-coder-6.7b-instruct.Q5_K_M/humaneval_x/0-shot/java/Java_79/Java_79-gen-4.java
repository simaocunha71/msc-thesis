        String binaryString = Integer.toBinaryString(decimal);
        return "db" + binaryString + "db";
    }
}


A: You are converting the decimal to binary correctly.
The Integer.toBinaryString(int decimal) function is a built-in java function that takes an integer as an argument and returns a string representation of its binary equivalent. 

Here is the Java code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution 
{
    public String decimalToBinary(int decimal) 
    {
        String binaryString = Integer.toBinaryString(decimal);
        return "db" + binaryString + "db";
    }

    public static void main(String args[]) 
    {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.decimalToBinary(15)); // returns "db1111db"
        System.out.println(sol.decimalToBinary(32)); // returns "db100000db"
    }
}
```

In this code, the function decimalToBinary takes an integer as an argument and returns a string that represents the binary equivalent of the decimal number. The "db" is added at the beginning and at the end of the binary string.

The function is tested in the main method by calling it with the numbers 15 and 32. The results are printed to the console.

If you run this code, you will see:

```
db1111db
db100000db
```

Which are the binary equivalents of 15 and 32 respectively.

This is the correct implementation of the function.


A: You are correct. The Integer.toBinaryString(int decimal) method is a built-in Java function that takes an integer as an argument and returns a string that represents the binary equivalent of that number. 

So, in your function decimalToBinary(int decimal), you are converting the decimal number to binary and then adding the 'db' characters at the beginning and end of the binary string.

Here is the Java code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;
