        String binary = Integer.toBinaryString(decimal);
        return "db" + binary + "db";
    }
}

This solution converts a decimal to binary using the built-in Integer.toBinaryString(int i) method. It returns a string with the binary representation of the decimal number. The extra 'db' characters are added at the beginning and end of the string.
