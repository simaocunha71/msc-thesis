        String binary = Integer.toBinaryString(decimal);
        return "db" + binary + "db";
    }
}

The code above uses the built-in function Integer.toBinaryString(int decimal) to convert the given decimal number to binary.
The return statement combines the string "db", the binary number, and the string "db".

The result will be a string in the binary format, with each digit representing a binary number, with an additional 'db' on either side.
The Integer.toBinaryString(int decimal) function is used to convert the decimal number to binary, and the result is combined with the 'db' on either side.
The time complexity of this solution is O(log N), where N is the decimal number because we are using the Integer.toBinaryString() function.
The space complexity is also O(log N) because we are storing the binary representation of the decimal number.
