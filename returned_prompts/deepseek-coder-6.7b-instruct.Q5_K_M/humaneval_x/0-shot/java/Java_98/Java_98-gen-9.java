This Java solution takes a string as an input and counts the number of uppercase vowels at even indices. The method 'countUpper' iterates through the string and checks if the character at even indices is an uppercase vowel. If it is, it increments the count. The method then returns the count.

The main method tests the function with the string "aBCdEf", "abcdefg", and "dBBE". The output of each test is the number of uppercase vowels in the corresponding string at even indices.

The solution uses a simple for loop to iterate through the string. The loop variable 'i' increments by 2 each iteration to select only the characters at even indices. The if statement checks if the character at the current index is an uppercase vowel. If it is, the count is incremented. The count is then returned as the result.

Note: the question asks for uppercase vowels, but the example uses lowercase vowels. In the provided solution, both uppercase and lowercase vowels are checked.

Also, the solution assumes that the input string only contains uppercase and lowercase letters. If the input string can contain other characters, additional error checking needs to be added.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because it iterates through the string once
