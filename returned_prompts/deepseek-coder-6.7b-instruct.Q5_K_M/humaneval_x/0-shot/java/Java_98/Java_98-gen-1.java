        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i += 2) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == 'A' || s.charAt(i) == 'E' || s.charAt(i) == 'I' || s.charAt(i) == 'O' || s.charAt(i) == 'U') {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}

This solution works by looping through the string, incrementing a count each time it encounters an uppercase vowel at an even index. It then returns the count.

In the question, the problem statement mentions "uppercase vowels in even indices", but it doesn't specify whether to consider only the first letter of each word or all letters in the string. This solution assumes all letters in the string.

// Time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because we are looping through the string once.
// Space complexity of this solution is O(1), as we are using a constant amount of space to store the count and the string characters.

// I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.

// This solution assumes all letters in the string are uppercase. If this is not the case, we would need to add a check to ensure we are only counting uppercase letters.

// If we want to consider only the first letter of each word in the string, we would need to split the string by words and then check the first letter of each word. This would require a minor modification to
