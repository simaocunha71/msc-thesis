The provided code is a correct Java solution for the problem described. It iterates over the string from the start to the end with a step of 2 (even indices only), and for each character checks whether it is an uppercase vowel. If it is, the count is increased. The final count is returned as the result.

Test Cases:

countUpper("aBCdEf") returns 1, as the only uppercase vowel at even index is 'E'.
countUpper("abcdefg") returns 0, as there are no uppercase vowels at even indices.
countUpper("dBBE") returns 0, as there are no uppercase vowels at even indices.

Thus, the provided code passes all the test cases and is a correct solution.

Possible Improvement:

It's a good idea to add a null check at the beginning of the method to handle the case where the input string is null. This can prevent a NullPointerException.

Updated code:

```java
public int countUpper(String s) {
    if(s == null) {
        return 0;
    }

    int count = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i += 2) {
        if(s.charAt(i) == 'A' || s.charAt(i) == 'E' || s.charAt(i) == 'I' || s.charAt(i) == 'O' || s.charAt(i) == 'U') {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

This updated code will return 0 when the input string is null, which is a more robust solution.
