  const notDivisible = l.filter((_, i) => (i + 1) % 3 !== 0);
  const divisible = l.filter((_, i) => (i + 1) % 3 === 0);
  
  divisible.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  
  return l.map((_, i) => (i + 1) % 3 === 0 ? divisible.shift() : l[i]);
};

console.log(sortThird([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]));


A: Here is the solution using JavaScript.

```javascript
const sortThird = (l) => {
  let divisible = l.filter((_, i) => (i + 1) % 3 === 0).sort((a, b) => a - b);
  return l.map((_, i) => (i + 1) % 3 === 0 ? divisible.shift() : l[i]);
};

console.log(sortThird([1, 2, 3])); // [1, 2, 3]
console.log(sortThird([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])); // [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
```

This solution first filters the elements of the array at the indices that are divisible by 3, sorts them and assigns the sorted array to the variable "divisible". Then, it maps over the original array and for each element, checks if the index is divisible by 3. If it is, it replaces the element with the first element of the sorted array "divisible" (and removes this element from the array "divisible" using the shift method). If the index is not divisible by 3, it leaves the element as it is. The resulting array is returned.

The filter function is used to get the elements at the indices that are divisible by 3. The sort function is used to sort the elements at the indices that are divisible by 3. The map function is used to replace the elements at the indices that are divisible by 3 with the elements of the sorted array "divisible
