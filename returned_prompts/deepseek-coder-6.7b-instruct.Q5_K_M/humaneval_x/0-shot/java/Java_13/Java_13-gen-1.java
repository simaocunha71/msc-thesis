        if (b == 0) {
            return a;
        } else {
            return greatestCommonDivisor(b, a % b);
        }
    }
}


A: Yes, the function works as expected. It uses the Euclidean Algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers. If b is zero, the function returns a, which is the greatest common divisor. Otherwise, it calls itself with b and the remainder of a divided by b.

The function works by continually reducing the size of the problem by making b the smaller number and the remainder the new number until b is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the greatest common divisor.

This is a classic example of recursion in mathematics and computer science.

The time complexity of this function is O(log min(a, b)). This is because in each recursive call, we are reducing the size of the problem by at least a factor of 2.

The space complexity of this function is O(1), because the space used does not increase with the size of the input.

The function is correct and efficient.

Here is the function for reference:

```java
public int greatestCommonDivisor(int a, int b) {
    if (b == 0) {
        return a;
    } else {
        return greatestCommonDivisor(b, a % b);
    }
}
```

This function can be used to find the greatest common divisor of two integers. For example:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Solution solution = new Solution();
    System.out.println(solution.greatestCommonDivisor(3, 5)); // Output: 1
    System.out.println(solution.greatestCommonDivisor(25, 15)); // Output: 5
}
```

This will print the greatest common divisor of 3 and 5 as 1, and the greatest common divisor of 25 and 15 as 5.
