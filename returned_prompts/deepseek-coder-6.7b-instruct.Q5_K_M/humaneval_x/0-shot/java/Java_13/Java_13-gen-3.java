        if (b == 0) {
            return a;
        } else {
            return greatestCommonDivisor(b, a % b);
        }
    }
}

I understand the concept of Euclidean algorithm, but I'm not sure how to implement it in this problem. I tried to adapt the Euclidean algorithm to this problem, but to no avail.

A: Your solution is correct. This algorithm uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers. It is a recursive function, which means it calls itself with new arguments until it reaches the base case (b == 0).

Here's the breakdown of the algorithm:


*

*If b is 0, the GCD of a and b is a. This is the base case of the recursion.

*If b is not 0, the GCD of a and b is the GCD of b and the remainder of a divided by b. This is the recursive step of the algorithm.


In the end, it will return the GCD of the original a and b.

A: Here's how you can use this function:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Solution solution = new Solution();
    System.out.println(solution.greatestCommonDivisor(3, 5)); // Outputs 1
    System.out.println(solution.greatestCommonDivisor(25, 15)); // Outputs 5
}
```

In the main method, you create an instance of the Solution class and call the greatestCommonDivisor method with different pairs of integers. The results are printed to the standard output.

The output of the program will be:

```
1
5
```

This shows that the greatest common divisor of 3 and 5 is 1, and the greatest common divisor of 25 and 15 is 5, as expected.
