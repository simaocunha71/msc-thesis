            return a;

A: 
I think you are correct. This is the correct code to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using recursion. The algorithm used here is called Euclidean algorithm. If 'b' is zero, then 'a' is the GCD, otherwise, we recursively call the function with 'b' and 'a%b' as arguments.
