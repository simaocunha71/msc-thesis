A: The problem with your code is that it sorts the list before finding the closest elements, which means that if the smallest difference is between two elements that are not adjacent in the sorted list, it will not be found.
The solution is to find the smallest difference while iterating over the list without sorting it. Here is the corrected code:
```java
public List<Double> findClosestElements(List<Double> numbers) {
    double minDiff = Double.MAX_VALUE;
    double minNum1 = 0, minNum2 = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size() - 1; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < numbers.size(); j++) {
            double diff = numbers.get(j) - numbers.get(i);
            if (diff < minDiff) {
                minDiff = diff;
                minNum1 = numbers.get(i);
                minNum2 = numbers.get(j);
            }
        }
    }
    return Arrays.asList(minNum1, minNum2);
}
```
This code works by comparing each pair of elements in the list and updating the minimum difference and corresponding elements whenever a smaller difference is found. The elements with the smallest difference are the closest in the original unsorted list.

Note: This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested loop. If the input list is large, you may need to consider a more efficient algorithm.

Also, keep in mind that this solution does not handle the case where there are multiple pairs of elements
