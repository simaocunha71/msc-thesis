        Collections.sort(numbers);
        double minDiff = Double.MAX_VALUE;
        List<Double> closest = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size() - 1; i++) {
            double diff = numbers.get(i+1) - numbers.get(i);
            if (diff < minDiff) {
                minDiff = diff;
                closest.clear();
                closest.add(numbers.get(i));
                closest.add(numbers.get(i+1));
            }
        }
        return closest;
    }
}

This solution sorts the list of numbers and then checks the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers. If the difference is less than the current minimum difference, it updates the minimum difference and the closest pair of numbers. Finally, it returns the closest pair of numbers.


A: Here is the Python code:
def findClosestElements(numbers):
    numbers.sort()
    minDiff = float('inf')
    closest = []
    for i in range(len(numbers)-1):
        diff = numbers[i+1] - numbers[i]
        if diff < minDiff:
            minDiff = diff
            closest = [numbers[i], numbers[i+1]]
    return closest

print(findClosestElements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2]))
print(findClosestElements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]))

This code works in a similar way as the Java code. It sorts the numbers list and then iterates over the list to find the two numbers that are closest to each other. If the difference between the current pair of numbers is less than the current minimum difference, it updates the minimum difference and the closest pair of numbers. Finally, it returns the closest pair of numbers.

A: Here is the JavaScript code:
function findClosestElements(numbers) {
    numbers.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    let minDiff = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;
