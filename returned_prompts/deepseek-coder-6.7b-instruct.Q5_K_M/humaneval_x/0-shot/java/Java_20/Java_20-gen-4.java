A: Here's the correct Java code to solve the problem:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<Double> findClosestElements(List<Double> numbers) {
        Collections.sort(numbers);
        int left = 0;
        int right = 1;
        double minDifference = numbers.get(right) - numbers.get(left);
        while (right < numbers.size() - 1) {
            double difference = numbers.get(right + 1) - numbers.get(left);
            if (difference < minDifference) {
                minDifference = difference;
                left = right;
                right++;
            } else {
                right++;
            }
        }
        return new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(numbers.get(left), numbers.get(right)));
    }
}
```

This code works by sorting the input list of numbers, then iterating through it to find the smallest difference between two consecutive numbers. The indexes of these two numbers are stored in `left` and `right`. Finally, a new list containing the two numbers with the smallest difference is returned.

The time complexity of this code is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, and the space complexity is O(1) as no extra space is used that scales with the input size.

It's worth noting that the initial problem statement seems to be incorrect, as it mentions returning two numbers, but the example outputs only show one pair. I've assumed the
