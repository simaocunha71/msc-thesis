A: Your code is correct. It sorts the numbers first, then it iterates over the list of numbers, computing the difference between each pair of consecutive numbers. If the difference is less than the current minimum difference, it updates the minimum difference and remembers the pair of numbers. Finally, it returns the remembered pair of numbers. The pair is sorted before returning it to ensure that the smaller number is always the first element.

Your code also handles the edge case where the minimum difference occurs between two identical numbers correctly. In this case, the pair of numbers returned will consist of the identical number and itself.

The time complexity of your code is O(n log n) because of the sorting step, where n is the size of the input list. The space complexity is O(1) as your code only uses a constant amount of extra space.

The provided solution is correct and efficient.

You can test this method using the following code:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Solution solution = new Solution();
    List<Double> numbers = Arrays.asList(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2);
    List<Double> closestElements = solution.findClosestElements(numbers);
    System.out.println(closestElements);  // Output: [2.0, 2.2]
}
```

This will print the pair of numbers that are the closest to each other in the list.
