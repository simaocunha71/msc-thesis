A: The problem statement seems to be a bit misleading. It says it wants you to return the "two that are the closest to each other". However, if by "closest" you mean the two numbers that are closest to each other in the list, then the provided solution will work. 

If by "closest" you mean the two numbers that are closest to the average of the list, then you need to modify the solution.

Here is a modified version of your solution:

```java
public List<Double> findClosestElements(List<Double> numbers) {
    double sum = 0;
    for(double num : numbers) {
        sum += num;
    }
    double average = sum / numbers.size();

    List<Double> result = new ArrayList<>();
    double minDifference = Double.MAX_VALUE;
    for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size() - 1; i++) {
        double difference = Math.abs(numbers.get(i+1) - numbers.get(i) - average);
        if (difference < minDifference) {
            minDifference = difference;
            result.clear();
            result.add(numbers.get(i));
            result.add(numbers.get(i+1));
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

This function now finds the two elements in the list that are closest to the average of all numbers in the list.

This is assuming that by "closest to the average" you mean the two elements that are closest to the average of all
