        for(int i = 1; i < numbers.size(); i++){
            double difference = numbers.get(i) - numbers.get(i-1);
            if(difference < minDifference){
                minDifference = difference;
                closest.clear();
                closest.add(numbers.get(i-1));
                closest.add(numbers.get(i));

        return closest;

}


A: The issue with the original code is that it doesn't handle the case where the difference between the smallest two numbers is zero.

In your case, when the two closest numbers are the same (like in the second example), the code will return them in the reverse order. To fix this, you should sort the list in ascending order first. Then, you can iterate over the list to find the two closest numbers.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    public List<Double> findClosestElements(List<Double> numbers) {
        Collections.sort(numbers);
        double minDifference = Double.MAX_VALUE;
        List<Double> closest = new ArrayList<>();

        for(int i = 1; i < numbers.size(); i++){
            double difference = numbers.get(i) - numbers.get(i-1);
            if(difference <= minDifference){
                minDifference = difference;
                closest.clear();
                closest.add(numbers.get(i-1));
                closest.add(numbers.get(i));
            }
        }

        return closest;
    }
}
```

This code will return the two numbers in ascending order if they are not the same. If they are the same, it will return them in ascending order.

And here is the updated docstring:

```python
"""
From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each
other and return them
