The solution provided checks the hexadecimal number character by character. If it is found in the set of prime hexadecimal digits, it increases the count of prime hexadecimal digits. In the end, it returns the count of prime hexadecimal digits found in the input string.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because it scans each character of the string once. The space complexity is also O(n), as in the worst case scenario (when all characters are unique), it could store all characters in the prime set.
