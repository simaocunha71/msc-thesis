        if (num == null || num.isEmpty()) {
            return 0;
        }

B:
        Set<Character> primeHexDigits = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList('2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D'));
        int count = 0;

C:
        for (char c : num.toCharArray()) {
            if (primeHexDigits.contains(c)) {
                count++;
            }
        }

D:
        return count;

}


A: Initial condition, the function checks if the input string is null or empty. If it is, the function returns 0.

B: A set is defined, which contains hexadecimal digits that are primes.

C: For each character in the input string, the function checks if it is in the set of prime digits. If it is, the count is increased by 1.

D: Finally, the function returns the count.

The function works by iterating over each character in the input string, and checking if it is in the set of hexadecimal digits that are primes. If it is, the count is increased. The function then returns the count.

It's worth noting that the function could be made more efficient by converting the hexadecimal digits to decimal and checking if they are prime, but this would not make a significant difference in terms of performance, and it would make the code more complex.


A: This is a simple solution. It uses a HashSet to store the prime hexadecimal digits. It then iterates over each character in the input string, checking if it is in the set of prime digits. If it is, the count is incremented. Finally, the count is returned.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the code:

A: If the input string is null or empty, the function returns 0.

B: A HashSet is created to store the prime hexadecimal digits.

C: For each character in the input string, the function checks if it is in the set of prime digits. If it is, the count is incremented.

D: The function returns the count.

This solution assumes that the input
