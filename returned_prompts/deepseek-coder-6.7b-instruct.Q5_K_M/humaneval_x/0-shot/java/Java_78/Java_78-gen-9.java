        int count = 0;
        HashSet<Character> primeHex = new HashSet<Character>(Arrays.asList('2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D'));
        for (int i = 0; i < num.length(); i++) {
            if (primeHex.contains(num.charAt(i))) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}


A: You're correct. The code you've written checks for prime numbers in hexadecimal representation. Here is the corrected version of your code:

```
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int hexKey(String num) {
        int count = 0;
        HashSet<Character> primeHex = new HashSet<Character>(Arrays.asList('2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D'));
        for (int i = 0; i < num.length(); i++) {
            if (primeHex.contains(num.charAt(i))) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

This code creates a HashSet containing the hexadecimal digits that are prime. It then iterates over each character in the input string, and if the character is in the HashSet, it increases the count. Finally, it returns the count.

The output of the function hexKey for the input "AB" is 1, for the input "1077E" is 2, for the input "ABED1A33" is 4, for the input "123456789ABCDEF0" is 6, and for the input "2020" is 2.

You've made a good point about the use of HashSet to improve the performance of the contains() method. This code is simple and efficient, and should work as expected.

Please note that the digits 'B' and 'D' are included in the primeHex HashSet, but they are not prime numbers in decimal representation. The decimal representation of 'B' is 11, which is not a prime number, and the decimal representation of 'D
