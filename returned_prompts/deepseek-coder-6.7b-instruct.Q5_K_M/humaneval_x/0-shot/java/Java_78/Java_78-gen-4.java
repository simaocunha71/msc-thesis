        Set<Character> hex = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList('2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D'));
        int count = 0;

B:
        for(char c : num.toCharArray()) {
            if(hex.contains(c)) {
                count++;
            }
        }

C:
        return count;
    }
}

What does this code do?


*

*First, we create a set of hexadecimal digits that are primes.

*Then, we iterate over each character in the input string. If the character is in the set of primes, we increment the count.

*Finally, we return the count.


What are the possible improvements of this solution?


*

*We could improve the performance by creating a HashSet of prime hexadecimal digits once and reusing it.

*We could also use a switch statement instead of a HashSet to check if a hexadecimal digit is prime, which might be faster if the number of primes is large.

*We could also use a bitwise operation to check if a hexadecimal digit is prime, which might be faster if the number of primes is large.

*We could also use parallel streams to check if a hexadecimal digit is prime, which might be faster if the number of primes is large.

*We could also use a regular expression to count the number of primes, which might be faster if the number of primes is large.

*We could also use a HashMap to map hexadecimal digits to their decimal equivalents and check if a decimal number is prime, which might be faster if the number of primes is large.

*We could also use a bitmask to check if a hexadecimal digit is prime, which might be faster if the number of primes is large.
