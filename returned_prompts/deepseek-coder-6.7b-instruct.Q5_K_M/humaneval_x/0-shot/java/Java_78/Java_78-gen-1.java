        int count = 0;
        String hex = "2357BDF";
        for (char c : num.toCharArray()){
            if (hex.indexOf(c) != -1) count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}

The code creates a string of hexadecimal numbers that are prime. It then loops through each character in the input string, and if the character is in the string of prime hexadecimal numbers, it increments a count. The function finally returns the count.

The complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string. The space complexity is O(1), as the amount of extra space used does not increase with the size of the input string.

The solution works by using the String method indexOf() to check if each character in the input string is in the string of prime hexadecimal numbers. If it is, the count is incremented. The final count is returned as the result.

The solution assumes that the input string is always correct or an empty string, and that the symbols A, B, C, D, E, F are always uppercase. The solution may not work correctly if these assumptions are not met.

The solution may not work correctly if the input string contains lowercase letters, as the indexOf() method is case sensitive.

The solution may not work correctly if the input string contains characters that are not hexadecimal digits, as the indexOf() method returns -1 if the character is not found in the string of prime hexadecimal numbers.
