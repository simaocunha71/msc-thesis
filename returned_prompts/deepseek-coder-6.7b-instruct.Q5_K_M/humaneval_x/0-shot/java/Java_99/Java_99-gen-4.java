This solution works by first converting the given string to a double. It then checks whether the number is positive or negative. If it is positive, it rounds up to the nearest integer using the ceil() function. If it is negative, it rounds down to the nearest integer using the floor() function.

In the case of a tie (when the given number is exactly halfway between two integers), the Math.ceil() function rounds up, and the Math.floor() function rounds down, resulting in the desired behavior of rounding away from zero.

This solution should work for all valid inputs, as it uses the built-in Java Math.ceil() and Math.floor() functions to handle the rounding.

If you want to round towards zero, you would use Math.floor() for positive numbers and Math.ceil() for negative numbers.

Here's the modified code:

```java
public int countUpper(String value)  {
    double num = Double.parseDouble(value);
    if (num > 0) {
        return (int)Math.ceil(num);
    } else {
        return (int)Math.floor(num);
    }
}
```

I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.


A: Here's the modified code:

    if (num > 0) {
        return (int)Math.ceil(num);
    } else {
        return (int)Math.floor(num);
    }
