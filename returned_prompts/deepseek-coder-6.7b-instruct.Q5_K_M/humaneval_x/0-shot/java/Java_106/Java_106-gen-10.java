The above solution provides the required output. The function factorial(int num) calculates the factorial of a number and the function sum(int num) calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to num. The function f(int n) creates a list of size n as per the problem statement. The list is populated with the factorial of the number if it's even indexed or the sum of numbers from 1 to that index if it's not.

The time complexity of the solution is O(n^2) due to the fact that inside the loop, we are calculating the factorial and sum of numbers from 1 to num. The space complexity is O(n) because we are storing the result in a list of size n.

This solution can be improved by reducing the time complexity. The factorial and sum of numbers can be calculated once and stored in variables, and then used to populate the list. However, the improvement would be marginal as the time complexity remains O(n^2) due to the nature of the problem.
