This solution first initializes an empty list. Then it fills this list with elements calculated according to the problem's conditions. The function f takes in an integer n and returns a list of size n. The elements of the list are either the factorial of the index if the index is even or the sum of numbers from 1 to the index if the index is odd. The factorial is calculated using the factorial helper function and the sum of numbers is calculated using the sumOfNumbers helper function.

The helper functions factorial and sumOfNumbers are used to calculate the factorial and the sum of numbers respectively.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) as there are two nested loops. One loop is to go through each index from 1 to n and the other loop is to calculate the factorial or the sum of numbers. The space complexity is O(n) as we are storing the result in a list.

This solution assumes that n is a positive integer and that the input is valid. If n is negative or if the input is not valid, additional error checking would be needed.
