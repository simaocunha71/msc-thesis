The function f takes a parameter n and returns a list of size n. The function checks if the index i is even or odd and based on that, it adds either the factorial of i or the sum of numbers from 1 to i to the list.
The function factorial calculates the factorial of a given number, and the function sum calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to i.
The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) because of the nested loop structure in the factorial and sum methods.



'''

# The function takes an integer n as a parameter and returns a list of size n.

# If the index i is even, the function adds the factorial of i to the list.
# If the index i is odd, the function adds the sum of numbers from 1 to i to the list.

# The factorial of i is the multiplication of the numbers from 1 to i.
# For example, the factorial of 4 (4!) is 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24.

# The sum of numbers from 1 to i is (i * (i + 1)) / 2.
# For example, the sum of numbers from 1 to 4 is 4 * (4 + 1) / 2 = 10.

# The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) because of the nested loop structure in the factorial and sum methods.

# The space complexity is O(n) because we store the result in a list of size
