## Solution Analysis 

The solution uses a for loop to iterate over the range from 1 to n (inclusive). For each iteration, it checks if the index i is even or odd. If i is even, it calculates the factorial of i and adds it to the list. If i is odd, it calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to i and adds it to the list. The function returns the resulting list.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) because of the nested for loops. The space complexity is O(n) because we are storing n elements in the list. 

The factorial calculation is done by multiplying the numbers from 1 to i, and the sum calculation is done by adding the numbers from 1 to i. Both operations are
