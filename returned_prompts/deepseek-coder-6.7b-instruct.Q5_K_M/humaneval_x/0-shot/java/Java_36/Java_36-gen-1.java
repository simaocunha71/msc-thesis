A: Your problem statement is a bit confusing as it says "Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13." But it's not clear what you mean by "which are divisible by 11 or 13". Are you looking for numbers divisible by 11 or 13? Or by both? 

Assuming you mean by "which are divisible by 11 or 13" numbers divisible by both 11 and 13, you're right in your approach. You need to iterate over all numbers from 11 to n (exclusive), and check if they're divisible by 11 or 13. If they are, you count how many times the digit 7 appears in them.

The countDigits method works correctly, it counts how many times a specific digit appears in a number.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    public int fizzBuzz(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 11; i < n; i++) {
            if (i % 11 == 0 || i % 13 == 0) {
                count += countDigits(i, 7);
            }
        }
        return count;
    }

    private int countDigits(int number, int digit) {
        int count = 0;
        while (number > 0) {
            if (number % 10 == digit) count++;
