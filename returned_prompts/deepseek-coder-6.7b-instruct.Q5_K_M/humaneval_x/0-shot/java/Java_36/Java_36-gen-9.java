A: The answer is incorrect.
Here, I have corrected it.

import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    public int fizzBuzz(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (i % 11 == 0 || i % 13 == 0) {
                count += countDigit(i, 7);
            }
        }
        return count;
    }

    public int countDigit(int number, int digit) {
        int counter = 0;
        while (number > 0) {
            if (number % 10 == digit) counter++;
            number = number / 10;
        }
        return counter;
    }
}

In the original code, the loop started from 11 and went up to n. This is incorrect because the problem statement specifies that we should check numbers less than n and divisible by 11 or 13, not greater than n. Therefore, we should start from 0 and go up to n - 1.

In the countDigit method, the while loop should be executed as long as number is greater than 0, not less than 0. This is because the loop should continue until all digits in the number have been checked, not until the number itself is zero.

Also, the condition in the countDigit method should be number % 10 == digit, not number / 10 == digit, because we want to check the last digit of the number, not the digit before the last.
