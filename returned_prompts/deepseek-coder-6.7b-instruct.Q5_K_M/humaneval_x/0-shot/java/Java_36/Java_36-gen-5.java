        int count = 0;
        String number;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (i % 11 == 0 || i % 13 == 0) {
                number = String.valueOf(i);
                for (int j = 0; j < number.length(); j++) {
                    if (number.charAt(j) == '7') {
                        count++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}

This code works by iterating through numbers less than n. If the number is divisible by 11 or 13, it converts the number to a string and iterates through the characters of the string to count the number of times '7' appears. The count is then returned at the end of the function.

The time complexity of this code is O(n) because it iterates through all the numbers less than n. The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the count and the number.
