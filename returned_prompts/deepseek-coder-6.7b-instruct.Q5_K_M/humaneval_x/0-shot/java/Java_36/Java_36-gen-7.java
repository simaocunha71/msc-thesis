        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 11; i < n; i++) {
            if (i % 11 == 0 || i % 13 == 0) {
                count += countDigit(i, 7);
            }
        }
        return count;
    }

    public int countDigit(int number, int digit) {
        int count = 0;
        while (number != 0) {
            if (number % 10 == digit)
                count++;
            number = number / 10;

The given code counts the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13. The method countDigit is used to count the number of times the digit 7 appears in the number. The main method fizzBuzz checks all numbers from 11 to n and updates the count if the number is divisible by 11 or 13.
The time complexity of this solution is O(n).

Here is a python version of the same code:

```python
class Solution:
    def fizzBuzz(self, n: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        for i in range(11, n):
            if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:
                count += self.countDigit(i, 7)
        return count

    def countDigit(self, number: int, digit: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        while number != 0:
            if number % 10 == digit:
                count += 1
            number = number // 10
        return count
```

In this python version, we use the same logic as the Java version. We initialize a count variable to 0 and then iterate over all numbers from 11 to n. If a number is divisible by 11 or 13, we update the count by the number of times the digit 7 appears in the number. The countDigit function is used to count the number of times the digit 7 appears in a number.
