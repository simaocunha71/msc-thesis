This solution works by looping through all numbers from 11 to n-1 and checks if the current number is divisible by 11 or 13. If it is, the count of digit 7 in this number is added to the total count.

The countDigits method counts the number of times the digit appears in a given number. It works by continuously dividing the number by 10 (which gives the last digit) and incrementing the count if the last digit is equal to the digit we're counting. This process repeats until the number becomes 0.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the input number. This is because we are looping through all numbers from 11 to n-1. The space complexity is O(1), as we are using a constant amount of space to store the count and the current number.

The question asked to implement a function that counts the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13. This function is implemented as the fizzBuzz method in the code above. The function takes an integer n as input and returns the count of the digit 7 as an integer.

The function uses a helper method countDigits to count the number of times the digit 7 appears in a given number. The helper method takes a number and a digit as input and returns the count of the digit in the number as an integer.

The function uses a for loop to iterate through all numbers from 11 to n-1. For each number, it checks if the number is divisible by 11 or 13. If it is, it counts the number
