        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();

        for(int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
            if(isPrime(i)) {
                result.add(i);
            }
        }

        return result;
    }

    private boolean isPrime(int num) {
        if(num <= 1) {
            return false;
        }

        for(int i = 2; i < num; i++) {
            if(num % i == 0) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
}

This is the solution in Java.
Here is how it works:
1. The countUpTo function loops from 2 to n-1 and for each number, it checks if it is prime by calling the isPrime function.
2. If the number is prime, it is added to the result list.
3. Finally, the result list is returned.
4. The isPrime function checks if a number is prime by looping from 2 to num - 1 and checking if num is divisible by any of these numbers. If it is, then num is not prime and false is returned. If num is not divisible by any of these numbers, then num is prime and true is returned.

The time complexity for this solution is O(n^2) because of the two nested loops. The outer loop runs n-1 times and for each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop runs n-1 times. So the time complexity is O(n^2).

The space complexity is O(n) because in the worst case (when all numbers less than n are prime), the result list will store n-1 prime numbers.

If we consider the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, it would be more efficient with a time complexity of O(n log log n) and a space complexity of O(n), but it requires more advanced knowledge of algorithms.

//This solution also assumes that the input will be a non-negative integer. If the input can be a negative number or a decimal, the isPrime function and the countUpTo function would need to be adjusted accordingly.
