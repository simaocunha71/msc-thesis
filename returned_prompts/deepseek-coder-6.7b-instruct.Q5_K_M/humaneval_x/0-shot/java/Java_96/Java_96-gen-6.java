The function isPrime is used to check whether a number is prime or not. It's a common method to check prime numbers.

The function countUpTo first runs through each number in the range from 2 to n (not including n). For each number, it checks if it is prime with the isPrime function. If it is, it adds it to the list of prime numbers. Finally, it returns the list of prime numbers.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n*sqrt(n)), due to the fact that for each number in the range, we have to check up to its square root to see if it is prime. The space complexity is O(n), because in the worst case, we may have to store all the prime numbers up to n.

This is a brute-force approach, but it gets the job done. For more optimized solutions, you might want to look into Sieve of Eratosthenes, which is an algorithm for finding all primes up to a given limit.

Please note that the function will return an empty list if the input is less than 2. This is because there are no prime numbers less than 2.

A: In your code, you have a minor error in the countUpTo function. The return type of the function should be List<Integer>, not List<int>.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution  {
    /**
    Implement a function that takes an non-negative integer and returns an array of the first n
    integers that are prime numbers and less than n.
    for example:
    countUpTo
