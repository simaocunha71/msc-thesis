        List<String> words = new ArrayList<String>();
        String[] splitWords = s.split("\\W+");
        for (String word : splitWords) {
            words.add(word);
        }
        return words;
    }
}


A: The solution is correct, but it can be simplified a bit by using Java 8 streams. Here's how you can do it:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

public class Solution {
    public List<String> wordStrings(String s) {
        return Arrays.stream(s.split("\\W+")).collect(Collectors.toList());
    }
}
```

In this code, `s.split("\\W+")` splits the string into words using any non-word character as a delimiter. Then `Arrays.stream()` converts the resulting array into a stream, and `Collectors.toList()` collects the elements of the stream into a list.

This solution will work exactly the same way as the previous one, but it's a bit shorter and more modern.

Note: `\\W+` is a regular expression that matches any non-word character. `+` means one or more of the preceding element. So `\\W+` matches one or more non-word characters.

Also, you should ensure that your string does not end with a non-word character, because this will cause the last word to be missed. If you want to include the last word even if it ends with a non-word character, you should use `s.split("\\W")` instead.

Finally, the `\\W+` regular expression also includes whitespace characters, so if you want to split the string on spaces but not on other whitespace characters (like tabs and line breaks), you should use `s.split("\\s+")` instead.

Just to clarify, the `\\W` (non-word character) and `\\s` (whitespace character) are special regular expression characters that mean "match any non-word character" and "match any whitespace character", respectively. The `+` after them means "match one or more
