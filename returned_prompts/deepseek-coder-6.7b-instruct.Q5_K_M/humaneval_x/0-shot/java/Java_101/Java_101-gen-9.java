        List<String> words = new ArrayList<>();
        String[] splitWords = s.split("[, ]");
        for(String word : splitWords) {
            if(!word.isEmpty()) {
                words.add(word);
            }
        }
        return words;
    }
}


A: The solution provided is correct. It splits the string into words based on a delimiter, which is a comma or a space. The words are then added to an ArrayList and returned. The provided solution also takes care of cases where there are multiple delimiters in a row or at the beginning or end of the string, which would otherwise result in empty strings.

Here's the code once more:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution  {
    public List<String> wordStrings(String s)  {
        List<String> words = new ArrayList<>();
        String[] splitWords = s.split("[, ]");
        for(String word : splitWords) {
            if(!word.isEmpty()) {
                words.add(word);
            }
        }
        return words;
    }
}
```

This solution will work for any string input.

Test the solution with the following code:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        System.out.println(solution.wordStrings("Hi, my name is John"));
        System.out.println(solution.wordStrings("One, two, three, four, five, six"));
        System.out.println(solution.wordStrings("This is a test     "));
    }
}
```

This will print:

```java
[Hi, my, name, is, John]
[One, two, three, four, five, six]
[This, is, a, test]
```

So, the solution is correct and is working as expected.

Please note that the provided solution is case sensitive. If you want it to be case insensitive, you can convert the string to lower case or upper case before splitting it.
