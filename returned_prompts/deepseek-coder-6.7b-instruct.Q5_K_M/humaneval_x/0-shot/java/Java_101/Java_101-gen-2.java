        List<String> words = new ArrayList<String>();
        String[] wordArray = s.split("[\\s,]+");
        Collections.addAll(words, wordArray);
        return words;
    }
}


A: The solution provided is correct. It uses the split method of the String class to split the string on whitespace or commas. The regular expression "[\\s,]+" is used to match one or more spaces or commas. The result is then added to the list using Collections.addAll.
Here's a small test to validate the function:

```
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Solution solution = new Solution();
    System.out.println(solution.wordStrings("Hi, my name is John"));
    System.out.println(solution.wordStrings("One, two, three, four, five, six"));
}
```

Output:

[Hi, my, name, is, John]
[One, two, three, four, five, six]

The words are correctly separated and added to the list.

Also, it is good practice to include a Javadoc comment explaining what the method does.

```java
/**
 * Splits the input string into words based on commas and spaces.
 *
 * @param s the string to split
 * @return a list of words
 */
public List<String> wordStrings(String s) {
    // ... your code here ...
}
```

This will make it easier for other developers to understand what the method does.
