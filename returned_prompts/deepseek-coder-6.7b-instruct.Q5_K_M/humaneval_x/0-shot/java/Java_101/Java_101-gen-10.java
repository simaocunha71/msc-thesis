        List<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();
        String[] words = s.split("\\W+");
        for(String word : words){
            list.add(word);
        }
        return list;
    }
}

This solution uses the split method to split the string into an array of words based on non-word characters. The resulting array is then iterated over to populate the ArrayList.

The regular expression "\\W+" is used to match any non-word character. The plus sign after the character class (\\W) means one or more of the preceding element.

The resulting list is then returned.

In the example, the split method is called on the input string s. The resulting array is then iterated over using a for-each loop. Each word in the array is added to the ArrayList using the add method. The ArrayList is then returned.

This solution assumes that the input string will contain words separated by commas or spaces. If the input string contains other types of separators, the split method and regular expression will need to be adjusted accordingly.

This solution also assumes that the input string will not contain punctuation that is not attached to a word (for example, a period at the end of a sentence). If the input string contains such punctuation, it will need to be handled separately.

Note: This solution assumes that the input string will not contain any numbers or special characters that are not attached to a word. If the input string contains such characters, they will need to be handled separately.

This solution also assumes that the input string will not contain any leading, trailing, or consecutive spaces. If the input string contains such spaces, they will need to be handled separately.

To handle these cases, additional processing steps may be necessary.
