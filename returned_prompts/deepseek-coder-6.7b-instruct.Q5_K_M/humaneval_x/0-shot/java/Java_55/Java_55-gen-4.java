        if (n<=0)
            return 0;
        else if (n==1)
            return 1;
        else
        {
            int fib1 = 1, fib2 = 1, fibN = 1;
            for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++)
            {
                fibN = fib1 + fib2;
                fib1 = fib2;
                fib2 = fibN;
            }
            return fibN;
        }
    }
}

This algorithm works by using a for loop to iterate from 3 to n, updating the variables fib1, fib2, and fibN at each step. fibN is the nth Fibonacci number, and it is calculated by adding the last two Fibonacci numbers (fib1 and fib2). Finally, fibN is returned as the result.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n) because it performs a single loop from 3 to n. The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the Fibonacci numbers.

Please note that the method signature is public int fib(int n), which means the method is public and returns an integer. The method is named fib and it takes an integer n as a parameter. The method calculates and returns the nth Fibonacci number.

The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. The sequence is: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on.

The method checks if n is less than or equal to 0. If it is, the method returns 0 because the 0th Fibonacci number is 0. If n is 1, the method returns 1 because the 1st Fibonacci number is 1. Otherwise, the method calculates the nth Fibonacci number using a for loop that iterates from 3 to n.

At each iteration of the loop, the method calculates the next Fibonacci number by adding the last two Fibonacci numbers. It then updates fib1, fib2
