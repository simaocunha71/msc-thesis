            return n;

        int fib = 1;
        int prevFib = 1;

        for(int i=2; i<n; i++){
            int temp = fib;
            fib+= prevFib;

This solution uses a dynamic programming approach. It initializes the first two Fibonacci numbers to be 1, then it continuously adds the previous two numbers to get the next one, until it reaches the n-th Fibonacci number.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n) because it performs a single loop from 2 to n. The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the Fibonacci numbers.

This solution is also correct and efficient. It is a good example of how to use a loop to solve a problem in a step-by-step manner, and how to use variables to store intermediate results to avoid redundant computation.

The documentation of the method `fib` is also correct. It correctly describes what the method does, its input and output.

The method `fib` also correctly implements the Fibonacci sequence formula. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. It starts with 0 and 1.

Overall, this solution is well-documented and correctly implements the Fibonacci sequence formula.


A: Here is a Python solution that uses recursion to calculate the nth Fibonacci number. This solution is very efficient but it has a limitation because it can cause a stack overflow for large inputs due to the recursive nature of the algorithm.

```python
def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
