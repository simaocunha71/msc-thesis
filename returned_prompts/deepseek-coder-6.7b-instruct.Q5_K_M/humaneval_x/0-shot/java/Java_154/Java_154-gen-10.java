        for(int i = 0; i < b.length(); i++){
            String rotation = b.substring(i) + b.substring(0, i);
            if(a.contains(rotation))
                return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}


A: The code you provided is correct and it should work as expected. It checks all rotations of the second string in the first string. If it finds any rotation as a substring in the first string, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

In the cycpatternCheck method, you are given two strings a and b. You need to check if any of the rotations of the string b is a substring of the string a.

Here is the detailed explanation of the code:


*

*You start a loop from 0 to the length of the string b.

*In each iteration of the loop, you get the rotation of the string b by concatenating the substring of b starting from the current index to the end of the string and then concatenating the substring of b from the start of the string to the current index.

*You then check if the rotation of the string b is a substring of the string a using the contains method of the String class. If it is a substring, you return true.

*If the loop completes without finding a rotation of b as a substring in a, you return false.


This is how you can check if any rotation of a string b is a substring of a string a.

A: Here is the corrected code:

class Solution {
    public boolean cycpatternCheck(String a, String b) {
        for (int i = 0; i < b.length(); i++) {
            String rotation = b.substring(i) + b.substring(0, i);
            if (a.contains(rotation))
                return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}

In the given code, you are checking all the rotations of the second string in the first string. If you find any rotation as a substring in the first string, you return true. Otherwise, you return false. The function `cycpatternCheck` checks if any rotation of the string `b
