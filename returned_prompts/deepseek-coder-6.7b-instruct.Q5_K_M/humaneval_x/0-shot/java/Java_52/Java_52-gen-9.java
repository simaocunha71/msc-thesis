        for(int i=0; i<l.size(); i++){
            if(l.get(i)>=t){
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}


A: The code is almost correct, but it needs to check if the current element in the list is greater than or equal to the threshold. If it is, then you know that not all numbers are below the threshold, so you should return false immediately. 
Here is the corrected code:
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    public boolean belowThreshold(List<Integer> l, int t) {
        for(int i = 0; i < l.size(); i++){
            if(l.get(i) >= t){
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}

This code iterates over each element in the list, and checks if it is greater than or equal to the threshold. If it finds an element that is equal to or greater than the threshold, it immediately returns false, because not all numbers are below the threshold. If it doesn't find any such element, it returns true, indicating that all numbers are below the threshold.
