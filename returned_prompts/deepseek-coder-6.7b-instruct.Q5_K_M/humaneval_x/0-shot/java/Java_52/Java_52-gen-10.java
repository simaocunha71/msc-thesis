        for(int num : l) {
            if(num >= t) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}


A: The answer is correct. The function belowThreshold checks if all elements in the list l are less than the threshold t. If the element is greater than or equal to t, the function returns false immediately. If the function has gone through all the elements and not returned false, it means all elements are smaller than t, so it returns true.

A: Here is a more detailed explanation:


*

*We start a loop that iterates over all elements in the list l. The variable num takes on the value of each element in l one by one.

*Inside the loop, we perform a single comparison operation: num >= t. If num is greater than or equal to t, the result of this comparison operation is true, and the function immediately returns false.

*If the loop completes without any comparison operation being true, it means that all elements in l were less than t. In that case, the function returns true.


So in summary, the function is checking if all elements in l are less than t. If it finds any element that is greater than or equal to t, it immediately returns false. If it never finds such an element, it returns true.

A: The given solution is correct.
Here is the explanation of the code:
The function belowThreshold checks if all the elements of the list l are below a threshold t. It does so by iterating over the list and comparing each element with the threshold.
If it finds any element that is not below the threshold, it immediately returns false.
If it goes through the entire list without finding any such element, it returns true.

A: The code is correct and it does exactly what is asked in the question. This code is checking if all numbers in the list are below a certain threshold. If it finds a number that is equal to or above the threshold, it returns false immediately. If it doesn't find any such number, it returns true.

A: The function belowThreshold checks if all numbers in the list l are below a threshold t. It does so by iterating over the list and comparing each number with the threshold. If it finds a number that is not below the threshold, it immediately returns false
