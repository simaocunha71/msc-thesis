A: The answer is correct. It loops through each element of the list and checks if it is greater than or equal to the threshold. If it finds such an element, it immediately returns false. If it does not find such an element, it returns true after it has looped through the entire list.

A: Yes, your code is correct.
The function belowThreshold takes in a list of integers and a threshold as parameters.
It loops through each integer in the list. If it finds an integer that is greater than or equal to the threshold, it immediately returns false. If it does not find such an integer after checking all the integers in the list, it returns true.
So, if all numbers in the list are below the threshold, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

A: Your solution is correct.
It checks each number in the list to see if it is greater than or equal to the threshold. If it finds a number that is not below the threshold, it immediately returns false. If it has checked all numbers in the list and not found a number that is not below the threshold, it returns true.
So, if all numbers in the list are below the threshold, the function returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

A: Your solution is correct.
The function belowThreshold takes a list of integers and a threshold as parameters.
It iterates through each integer in the list. If it finds an integer that is greater than or equal to the threshold, it immediately returns false. If it does not find such an integer after checking all the integers in the list, it returns true.
So, if all numbers in the list are below the threshold, the function returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

A: Your code is correct and efficient. It goes through each number in the list to see if it is greater than or equal to the threshold. If it finds such a number, it immediately returns false, indicating that not all numbers are below the threshold. If it goes through the whole list without finding such a number, it returns true, indicating that all numbers are indeed below the threshold.

A: Yes, your code is correct.
The function belowThreshold takes a list of integers and
