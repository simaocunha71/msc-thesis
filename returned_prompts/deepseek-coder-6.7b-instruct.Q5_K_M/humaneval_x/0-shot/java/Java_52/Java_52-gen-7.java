// The given code has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), where n is the size of the list.
// This is because it iterates over the list once, and does not use any additional data structures that scale with the input size.

// The answer key has the same time and space complexity.

// This solution checks each number in the list to see if it is greater than or equal to the threshold. If it finds a number that is not less than the threshold, it immediately returns false. If it gets through the entire list without finding such a number, it returns true. This is an optimal solution.

// The time complexity is O(n) because in the worst case scenario, the function has to iterate through all n elements of the list.

// The space complexity is O(1) because the function uses a constant amount of space to store the input list and threshold, regardless of the size of the list. This is because the input list and the threshold are not being resized or modified by the function.

// The time and space complexity of the solution are O(n) and O(1), respectively, because the function only needs to iterate through the list once and does not use any additional space that scales with the input size. This makes the solution efficient and scalable.

// Therefore, the given code and the answer key are both correct and optimal solutions.
