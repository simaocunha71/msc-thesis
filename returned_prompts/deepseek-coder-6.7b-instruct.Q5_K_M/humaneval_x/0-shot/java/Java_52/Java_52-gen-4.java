A: You've got it. This solution checks every number in the list and if it is greater or equal to the threshold, it immediately returns false. If there are no numbers in the list that are greater or equal to the threshold, it will return true after iterating through the entire list.

A: You've done it perfectly. 
This function is iterating over all numbers in the list and checking if any number is greater than or equal to the threshold. If it finds such a number, it immediately returns false. If it doesn't find any such number after checking all numbers, it returns true.

A: Yes, you've got it. The code iterates over each integer in the list. If it finds one that is greater than or equal to the threshold, it immediately returns false. If it gets through the entire list without finding such an integer, it returns true.

A: Yes, you've done it correctly. This function goes through each number in the list and checks if it is greater than or equal to the threshold. If it finds one that is, it immediately returns false. If it goes through the entire list without finding such a number, it returns true.
