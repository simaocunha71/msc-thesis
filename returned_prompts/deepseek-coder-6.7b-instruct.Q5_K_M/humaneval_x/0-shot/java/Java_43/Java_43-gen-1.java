        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (int num : l) {
            if (set.contains(-num)) {
                return true;
            }
            set.add(num);
        }
        return false;
    }
}

Explain:
This solution uses a HashSet to store the elements of the list as we iterate through it. For each number in the list, we check if its negation is in the set. If it is, we return true because we've found a pair of numbers that sum to zero. If we get through the entire list without finding such a pair, we return false.

This works because the negation of a number is in the set if and only if the number is in the set. This is because we're storing the elements of the list in the set and we're checking for the negation of each number in the list. This means that if we find a number in the list that is in the set, we've found a pair of numbers that sum to zero.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the size of the list, because we're doing a single pass through the list. The space complexity is also O(n), because in the worst case we're storing all the elements of the list in the set.

The solution assumes that the input list is not null and contains at least one element. If the input list could be null or empty, then we would need to add some additional checks to handle this case.

This solution is correct because it correctly identifies pairs of elements in the list that sum to zero. It does this by using a set to keep track of the elements it has seen so far and checking if it has seen the negation of the current element.

Note: This solution will only return true if there are exactly two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and it does not handle the case where there are more than two such pairs. If you need to handle this case, you would need to modify the solution to keep track of more than just the elements it has seen so far.
