        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (Integer num : l) {
            if (set.contains(-num)) {
                return true;
            }
            set.add(num);
        }
        return false;
    }
}

This solution uses a HashSet to store the elements of the list. For each number in the list, it checks if its negation is already in the set. If it is, it returns true, indicating that there are two elements that sum to zero. If it finishes the loop without finding such a pair, it returns false. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the list, because it needs to go through the list once. The space complexity is also O(n), because in the worst case (when all elements are distinct), it needs to store all the elements in the set.

This solution assumes that the input list is not null and contains at least one element. It also assumes that the elements of the list are integers.

I hope this explanation is clear. If you have any questions, please let me know.

A: The question is asking for a function that checks if there are two distinct numbers in a given list that sum up to zero. The function should return a boolean value indicating whether such a pair exists or not.

Here is a Python solution using a set to track the numbers we have seen so far. We iterate over the list, and for each number, we check if its opposite (-number) is in the set. If it is, we have found a pair that sums to zero and we return True. If we go through the entire list without finding such a pair, we return False.

```python
def pairsSumToZero(lst):
    seen = set()
    for num in lst:
        if -num in seen:
            return True
        seen.add(num)
    return False
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the list, because we go through the list once. The space complexity is O(n) as well, because in the worst case (when all elements are distinct), we store all the elements in the set.

The question also specifies that the input list is not null and contains at least one element
