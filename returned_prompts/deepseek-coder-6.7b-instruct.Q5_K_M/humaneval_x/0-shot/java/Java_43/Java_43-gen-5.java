Explanation:
The solution starts by sorting the input list. This is necessary because we want to use the two-pointer technique, where we start by pointing to the smallest and largest elements in the list. If the sum of the elements at the pointers is less than 0, we increment the start pointer; if the sum is greater than 0, we decrement the end pointer. If the sum is 0, we have found a pair that sums to 0, so we return True. If we traverse the entire list without finding such a pair, we return False.

This solution runs in O(n log n) time due to the sorting step, and in O(n) space because we're using a constant amount of space to store the start and end pointers.

This solution assumes that the input list is not empty and does not contain any null values.
