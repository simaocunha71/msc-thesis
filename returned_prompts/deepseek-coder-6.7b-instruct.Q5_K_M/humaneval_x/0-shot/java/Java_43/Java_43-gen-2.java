        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (int num : l) {
            if (set.contains(-num)) {
                return true;
            }
            set.add(num);
        }
        return false;
    }

This solution works by using a HashSet to store the numbers in the list. For each number in the list, it checks if its negation is in the set. If it is, it means that there are two numbers that sum to zero, so it returns true. If it finds no such pair, it returns false.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the list, because it scans the list once. The space complexity is also O(n), because in the worst case, all the elements in the list can be distinct and be added to the set.

Note that the order of the numbers in the list doesn't matter in this solution.

Also, this solution assumes that the input list doesn't contain any null values.

Please note that this solution is case sensitive.

For example,

```
Input:
["1", "2", "3", "7"]
Output:
false
```

This is because the input is a list of strings, not a list of integers.

```
Input:
[2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7]
Output:
true
```

This is because the numbers 2 and -5 sum to zero.

```
Input:
[1]
Output:
false
```

This is because there are no two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero.

```
Input:
[1, 3, 5, 0]
Output:
false
```

This is because there are no two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero.

```
Input:
[1, 3, -2, 1]
Output:
false
```

This is because there are no two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero.

```
Input:
[2, 4, 3, 7]
Output:
false
```

This is because there are no two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero
