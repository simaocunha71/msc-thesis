        Set<Integer> set1 = new HashSet<>(l1);
        Set<Integer> set2 = new HashSet<>(l2);
        set1.retainAll(set2);
        List<Integer> common = new ArrayList<>(set1);
        Collections.sort(common);

A: The question is asking to return the sorted unique common elements in two lists.

*

*The first step is to convert both lists into Sets. This is done using new HashSet<>(l1) and new HashSet<>(l2).


*The retainAll() method is used on the first set (set1) to keep only the elements that are also present in the second set (set2).


*The result is then converted back to a List and sorted using Collections.sort().


*Finally, the sorted list of common elements is returned.


*Note that the complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting step.


*Also, the use of Sets makes sure that we don't have any duplicates in our result.


*This solution assumes that the input lists do not contain any null elements.


*If the input lists could contain null elements, you should handle this case appropriately.


*Also, if the input lists are very large, you might want to consider a more efficient solution that does not involve converting the lists to Sets.

A: It seems like you have posted the correct answer. The answer is correct and efficient. It uses the Java Collection Framework to find the common elements in two lists, removes duplicates and sort them. 

If you're looking for a more detailed explanation, here is how it works:

The function takes in two lists l1 and l2. It first converts these lists into sets using HashSet. A set in Java is a collection that contains no duplicate elements. So this step essentially removes any duplicate elements from the lists.

The retainAll() method then removes any elements from set1 that are not present in set2. This effectively gives us a set containing only the common elements present in both lists.

We then convert this set back into a List using new ArrayList<>(set1).

Finally, we sort this list using Col
