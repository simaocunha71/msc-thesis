        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();

        for (int i : l1) {
            if (l2.contains(i)) {
                set.add(i);
            }

A: Here is the correct code.

import java.util.*;

class Solution {

    public List<Integer> common(List<Integer> l1, List<Integer> l2) {
        List<Integer> commonList = new ArrayList<>();
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();

        for (int i : l1) {
            if (l2.contains(i)) {
                set.add(i);
            }
        }

        commonList.addAll(set);
        Collections.sort(commonList);
        return commonList;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.common(Arrays.asList(1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5), Arrays.asList(5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121)));
        System.out.println(sol.common(Arrays.asList(5, 3, 2, 8), Arrays.asList(3, 2)));
    }
}

The code you provided has a syntax error. In the for-each loop, variable 'i' was assigned a value in the scope of the loop, and that value would not have been updated in the original list. This is why the contains() method was not giving the expected results. 

In the corrected code, I have added a main method to test the functionality of the common method.

This will print the unique common elements of the two lists, sorted in ascending order.


A: Your solution is almost correct, but it contains a subtle bug. When you use l2.contains(i) to check if i
