        Set<Integer> s1 = new HashSet<>(l1);
        s1.retainAll(l2);
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>(s1);
        Collections.sort(result);
        return result;
    }
}

Explanation:
The problem requires finding the common elements in two lists, removing duplicates, sorting the result and returning it. 

The solution uses a HashSet to store the elements of the first list. Then it uses the method retainAll() to keep only the elements that are in the second list. The result is a set of common elements.

Then a new ArrayList is created using this set. The Collections.sort() method is used to sort this list. The method returns the sorted list of common elements.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting, where n is the number of common elements. The space complexity is O(n) for the HashSet and ArrayList.

The solution assumes that the input lists don't contain any null elements. If they can, a null check should be added before the retainAll() method call.

// This solution also assumes that the input lists don't contain any duplicate elements. If they can, a duplicate check should be added before the retainAll() method call.
