        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        if (!numbers.isEmpty()) {
            result.add(numbers.get(0));
            for (int i = 1; i < numbers.size(); i++) {
                result.add(delimiter);
                result.add(numbers.get(i));
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}

This solution uses ArrayList to store the result. It first checks if the input list is empty. If not, it adds the first element of the list to the result. Then it iterates over the rest of the list and for each element, adds the delimiter and the element to the result. Finally, it returns the result.
