                temp = (i/2)+1;
                result.add(temp);
            } else {
                temp = result.get(i-1) + result.get(i-2) + result.get(i+1);
                result.add(temp);

        return result;
    }
}

The above code is a simple implementation of the problem. The code uses a loop to calculate the Tribonacci sequence for numbers 0 to n. If the number is even, it calculates the number as (i/2)+1. If the number is odd, it calculates the number as the sum of the previous number, the second previous number and the next number in the sequence. The code returns the list of first n+1 numbers in the Tribonacci sequence.

In this code, I have used the ArrayList to store the numbers in the sequence. The ArrayList class in Java is a resizable array, which can grow and shrink dynamically. The add method is used to add elements to the ArrayList. The get method is used to retrieve elements from the ArrayList.

The time complexity of this code is O(n) because it loops from 0 to n and performs a constant amount of work for each iteration. The space complexity is also O(n) because it stores the first n+1 numbers in the sequence in an ArrayList.

Please note that this implementation may not be correct, as the problem statement seems to be incorrect. The given Tribonacci sequence in the problem
