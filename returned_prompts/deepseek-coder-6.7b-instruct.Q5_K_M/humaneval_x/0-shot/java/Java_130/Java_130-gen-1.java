    List<Integer> sequence = new ArrayList<Integer>();
    if(n>=0){
        sequence.add(3);
    }
    for(int i=1; i<=n; i++){
        if(i%2==0){
            sequence.add(sequence.get(i-1)+sequence.get(i)+1);
        }else{
            sequence.add(sequence.get(i-1)+1);
        }
    }
    return sequence;
}
}


A: Here is a Python solution for the problem:

```python
def tribonacci(n):
    sequence = [3, 3, 2]
    if n<3:
        return sequence[:n+1]
    else:
        for i in range(3, n+1):
            if i%2==0:
                sequence.append(sequence[i-1]+sequence[i]+1)
            else:
                sequence.append(sequence[i-1]+sequence[i-2]+sequence[i+1])
        return sequence

print(tribonacci(3))  # Output: [3, 3, 2, 8]
```

This Python script uses a list to store the Tribonacci sequence. The first three elements of the sequence are [3, 3, 2]. If n is less than 3, it returns the sequence up to the nth element. If n is 3 or greater, it iterates from 3 to n and appends the next number in the sequence to the list. If the index is even, the next number is the sum of the current number, the previous number, and 1. If the index is odd, the next number is the sum of the previous number, the one before that, and the next number in the sequence.

Please note that the Python script provided has a mistake in the calculation of the tribonacci sequence for odd indices. The rule for odd indices should be: tri(n) = tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n - 3). The corrected version of the script is provided below:

```python
def tribonacci(n):
    sequence =
