This solution initializes the first three numbers of the Tribonacci sequence. Then, it adds the next numbers using a loop, the condition of which depends on whether the index i is even or odd. If it's even, the next number is 1 + i / 2. If it's odd, the next number is the sum of the previous, the one before that, and the one before that. This is based on the rules of the Tribonacci sequence. The result is a list of the first n+1 Tribonacci numbers.
The time complexity of this solution is O(n).
