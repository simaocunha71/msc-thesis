        List<Integer> tri = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        if (n < 0) return tri;
        if (n >= 0) tri.add(3);
        if (n >= 1) tri.add(2);
        if (n >= 2) tri.add(8);

        for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                tri.add(1 + i / 2);
            } else {
                tri.add(tri.get(i - 1) + tri.get(i - 2) + tri.get(i + 1));
            }
        }

        return tri;
    }
}

Note: In the question, it is stated that the Tribonacci sequence starts with [1, 3, 2, 8]. However, the problem has been interpreted as starting with [3, 2, 8] and the first element is 1.

A: The problem states that the Tribonacci sequence starts with 3, 2, 8 and the first number in the sequence is 1. That means the sequence should be 1, 3, 2, 8 and then for each subsequent number, it should be the sum of the previous three numbers. For example, the fourth number is 8 (3 + 2 + 1), the fifth number is 21 (8 + 3 + 2), and so on.

In the code you posted, you are initializing the list with the first three numbers of the sequence (3, 2, 8) and then for each subsequent number, you are calculating it based on the previous three numbers. The problem is that you are trying to access an element at position i + 1 in the list when you are calculating the number at position i, which will give an IndexOutOfBoundsException because you haven't added this number to the list yet.

To fix the problem, you should just use the sum of the last three numbers in the list when calculating the next number in the sequence. Here's the corrected code:

```java
public List<Integer> tri(int n) {
    List<Integer> tri = new ArrayList<>();
    if (n < 0) return tri;
    if (n >= 0)
