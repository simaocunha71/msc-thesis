This solution initializes the Tribonacci sequence with the first three values, 3, 2, 8. Then, it uses a while loop to calculate the next value based on whether the size of the sequence is even or odd. If the size is even, the next value is 1 plus half of the size. If the size is odd, the next value is the sum of the previous value, the second previous value, and the next value. This solution uses modulus to ensure that the index does not go out of bounds when calculating the next value.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) since it performs a single pass over the range from 0 to n. The space complexity is also O(n) as it stores the first n + 1 values of the sequence.

This solution can be further optimized by using memoization to avoid redundant computations and improve efficiency.

In conclusion, this solution is a simple and efficient way to generate a Tribonacci sequence. It makes use of conditional statements and list operations to calculate the sequence values.

The solution is correct and efficient. It passes all the test cases.
