        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();

        for(int i = 0; i < a.length(); i++){
            int bit1 = a.charAt(i) - '0';
            int bit2 = b.charAt(i) - '0';
            int xor = bit1 ^ bit2;
            result.append(xor);
        }
        return result.toString();
    }
}

This solution iterates over the two strings, taking one character at a time from each string. It converts these characters to integers (by subtracting '0' from them), performs XOR on these integers, and then appends the result to a StringBuilder. Finally, it converts the StringBuilder back to a string and returns it.

It's assumed that the inputs are of the same length. If they're not, you'll have to add some error checking to make sure they are.

This solution assumes that the inputs are well-formed, i.e., they are composed only of 1s and 0s. If this is not the case, you'll need to add some error checking to make sure of it.

This solution also assumes that the inputs are not null. If they can be null, you'll need to add some error checking to make sure of it.

This solution assumes that the inputs are not empty. If they can be empty, you'll need to add some error checking to make sure of it.
