It is correct. I think there might be a typo in the question.
The XOR operation should be performed on the corresponding characters in the two strings, not on the characters and the string. So, the corrected code is:

```java
public String stringXor(String a, String b)  {
    // Create a new string to store the result
    StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();

    // Loop through the length of the strings
    for (int i = 0; i < a.length(); i++) {

        // Perform XOR operation on the corresponding characters of the strings
        // Append the result to the new string
        result.append((a.charAt(i) ^ b.charAt(i)) == '1' ? '1' : '0');
    }

    // Return the result
    return result.toString();
}
```

This code performs the XOR operation on the corresponding characters of the two strings, and appends the result to a StringBuilder. It then converts the StringBuilder back to a String and returns it. The ternary operator is used to convert the XOR result to a character ('1' or '0').

Please note that this code assumes that the input strings a and b are of the same length. If they are not, you may need to add additional code to handle the case where one string is longer than the other.

Also, note that the XOR operation in Java uses the '^' operator, which performs a bitwise XOR operation. The '==' operator is used to compare the result of the XOR operation with '1', which is equivalent to checking if the result is true or false.

This code should work as expected.
