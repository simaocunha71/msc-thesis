        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();

        // Iterate over each character in both strings
        for (int i = 0; i < a.length(); i++) {

            // Perform XOR operation on the corresponding characters
            // Append the result to the result string
            result.append(a.charAt(i) ^ b.charAt(i));
        }

        return result.toString();
    }

}

Here in this code, the XOR operation is performed on each character in string a and b, and the result is appended to the result string. The XOR operation is performed using the '^' operator, which performs a bitwise XOR operation on the binary representations of the characters. The result is then returned as a string.

However, there are two issues with this code:

1. It assumes that both strings a and b are of the same length. If this is not the case, it will throw an IndexOutOfBoundsException when it tries to access a character at an index that is out of range.

2. It does not handle the case where strings a and b are not of the same length. This code will not work correctly if a and b are not of the same length.

Here is a revised version of the code that handles both of these issues:

```java
public String stringXor(String a, String b) {
    StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();

    // Determine the length of the shorter string
    int length = Math.min(a.length(), b.length());

    // Iterate over each character in the shorter string
    for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        // Perform XOR operation on the corresponding characters
        // Append the result to the result string
        result.append(a.charAt(i) ^ b.charAt(i));
    }

    // If a is longer than b, append the remaining characters of a to the result
    if (a.length() > b.length()) {
        result.append(a.substring(length));
    }
    // If b is longer than a, append the remaining characters of b to the result
    else if (b.length() > a.length()) {
