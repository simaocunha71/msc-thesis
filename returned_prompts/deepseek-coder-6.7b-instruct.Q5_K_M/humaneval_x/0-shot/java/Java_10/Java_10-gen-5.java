The program first checks if the string is a palindrome. If it is, it returns the string. If not, it creates a string builder, which is a mutable sequence of characters. It then appends the reverse of the string to the end of the string. Finally, it returns the modified string.

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because we go through the string once and perform a constant amount of work for each character. The space complexity is also O(n), as we create a new string which is the same length as the input string.

This solution assumes that the input string is not null. If it can be null, you should add a null check at the beginning of the makePalindrome method.

Also, the method isPalindrome checks if a string is a palindrome by comparing the characters at the beginning and end of the string, moving inwards. This is a common approach for solving this problem.

The makePalindrome method first checks if the string is already a palindrome. If it is, it simply returns the string. If not, it creates a new string that is the original string followed by the reverse of the original string. This new string is a palindrome because it is the same as the original string followed by its reverse.
