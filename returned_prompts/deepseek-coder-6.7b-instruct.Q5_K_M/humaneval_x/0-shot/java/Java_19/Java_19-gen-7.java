        String[] strNum = {"zero", "one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight", "nine"};
        String[] numArr = numbers.split(" ");
        Arrays.sort(numArr, new Comparator<String>() {
            @Override
            public int compare(String o1, String o2) {
                return Arrays.asList(strNum).indexOf(o1) - Arrays.asList(strNum).indexOf(o2);
            }
        });

        return String.join(" ", numArr);
    }
}

This solution splits the input string into an array of words and then sorts it using a custom comparator that compares the index of each word in the strNum array. This effectively sorts the numbers in ascending order. The sorted array is then joined back into a string with spaces in between the words.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the number of words in the input string. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the split words and sorted words.

This solution assumes that the input string is correctly formatted and does not contain any invalid words. It also assumes that the numbers are sorted in ascending order initially.

Please note that this solution uses the in-built sort function of Java which uses a Dual-Pivot Quicksort by Vladimir Yaroslavskiy, Jon Bentley, and Joshua Bloch. This algorithm offers O(n log n) performance on many data sets that cause other quicksorts to degrade to quadratic performance, and is typically faster than other algorithms for these data sets.


A: Here is the Java solution:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(sortNumbers("three one five"));
    }

    public static String sortNumbers(String numbers) {
        String[] strNum = {"zero", "one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight", "nine"};
        String[] numArr = numbers.split(" ");
