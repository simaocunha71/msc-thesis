A: The sortNumbers function works by splitting the input string into an array of words (numbers represented as strings). It then creates a TreeMap where the keys are the number words and the values are the corresponding numbers (as strings). 

The Arrays.sort method is then used to sort the array of words based on the numbers they represent, which is done by providing a custom comparator that uses the TreeMap to compare the numbers represented by the words.

Finally, the sorted array of words is joined back into a single string with spaces in between and returned.

This solution works because the TreeMap allows for fast lookup of the corresponding number for each word, which is used in the custom comparator to sort the words.

Here is the output of the function for the input "three one five":

"one three five"

This means that the words are correctly sorted based on their corresponding numbers.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the number of words in the input string, because of the sorting operation. The space complexity is O(n), because of the use of the TreeMap and the array of words.
