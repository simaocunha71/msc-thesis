        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for(int i = 0; i < game.size(); i++){
            result.add(Math.abs(game.get(i) - guess.get(i)));
        }
        return result;
    }
}

Here, we are iterating over the given lists using a for loop. For each index, we calculate the absolute difference between the score and the guess at that index, and add this difference to the result list. At the end, we return the result list.

The Math.abs() function is used to ensure that the difference is always a positive number, which reflects the difference between the scores and the guesses, regardless of which number is larger.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the size of the input lists. This is because we perform a constant amount of work for each element in the lists. The space complexity is also O(n), because we create a new list to store the results.

Note: In Java, the List interface is used to represent a list, which is a type of data structure that can contain any number of elements. In this case, we are using it to represent both the scores and the guesses.

// This code will print the result of the compare function for each test case. If the result matches the expected output, then the function is working correctly.
