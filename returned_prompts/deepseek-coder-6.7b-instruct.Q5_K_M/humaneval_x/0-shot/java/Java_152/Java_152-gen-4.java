## Notes
This problem is a simple array manipulation problem. The key is to loop through each element in the given arrays and calculate the absolute difference between the corresponding elements in the two arrays.

This can be done using Java's `Math.abs` function, which returns the absolute value of a number. The result is then added to a new list which is returned at the end.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input lists. This is because we are looping through each element of the input lists once.

The space complexity is also O(n), because we are creating a new list to store the result.

This solution assumes that the input lists are of the same length and that they are not empty. If this is not the case, additional error checking should be added.

In the main method, we test the `compare` method with two pairs of input lists. The expected output is printed to verify the correctness of the solution.

The provided code is correct and should pass all the test cases.

## Solution
```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;
