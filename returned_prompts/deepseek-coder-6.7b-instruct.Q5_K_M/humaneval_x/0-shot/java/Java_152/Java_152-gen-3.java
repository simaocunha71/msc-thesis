        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for(int i = 0; i < game.size(); i++) {
            result.add(Math.abs(game.get(i) - guess.get(i)));
        }

A: It seems like you have a misunderstanding of how the problem works. The guesses and the scores should be in the same order, and if the guess is correct, the difference between the guess and the score should be 0, not the absolute difference.
Here is a correct solution:
public List<Integer> compare(List<Integer> game, List<Integer> guess) {
    List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
    for(int i = 0; i < game.size(); i++) {
        if (game.get(i).equals(guess.get(i))) {
            result.add(0);
        } else {
            result.add(Math.abs(game.get(i) - guess.get(i)));
        }
    }
    return result;
}

In this solution, we iterate over the two lists in parallel. If the scores and guesses at a given index are equal, we add 0 to the result. If not, we add the absolute difference between the scores and guesses at that index to the result.

A: Here is a more efficient solution using Java 8's Streams:
import java.util.*;
import java.util.stream.*;

public List<Integer> compare(List<Integer> game, List<Integer> guess) {
    return IntStream.range(0, game.size())
        .map(i -> Math.abs(game.get(i) - guess.get(i)))
        .boxed()
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
}

This solution uses Java's IntStream to iterate over the indices of the lists. For each index, it calculates the absolute difference between the corresponding elements in the game and guess lists and adds this difference to the result list. The boxed() method is used to convert the IntStream to a Stream<Integer> before collecting the results into a list.
