        int count = 0;
        for (int num : arr) {
            if (sumDigits(num) > 0) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }

    private int sumDigits(int num) {
        int sum = 0;
        while (num != 0) {
            sum += num % 10;
            num /= 10;
        }
        return sum;
    }
}

This code works by first initializing a count variable to 0. The countNums function loops through each number in the given array. For each number, it calls the sumDigits helper function, which calculates the sum of the digits of the number. If the sum of the digits is greater than 0, the count variable is incremented. Finally, the count variable is returned as the result.

The sumDigits function works by initializing a sum variable to 0. It then enters a loop where it continues as long as the number is not 0. In each iteration of the loop, it adds the last digit of the number to the sum and then removes the last digit from the number. This process is repeated until all digits have been processed. The final sum is then returned as the result.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n*m), where n is the number of elements in the array and m is the number of digits in the largest number in the array. This is because for each number in the array, the sumDigits function is called which runs in O(m) time. The space complexity is O(1), since no additional space is used that scales with the input size.

Please note, if you are using this in a coding interview, be sure to test your code with various inputs to ensure it is working as expected.
