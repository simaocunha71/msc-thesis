A: This solution works by first filtering the array to only contain numbers from 1 to 9. It then sorts this new array in descending order and converts each integer to its corresponding word.

Here, we use a list of strings named "numbers" which contains the names of numbers from 0 to 9. This list is used to get the name of a number from its integer value.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) as it involves sorting the array.

A: The problem is asking to sort the array in descending order and replace each integer with its corresponding word.

Here is a Python solution:

```python
def byLength(arr):
    numbers = ["", "One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", "Eight", "Nine"]
    arr = [i for i in arr if 1 <= i <= 9] # filter out numbers not between 1 and 9
    arr.sort(reverse=True) # sort the array in descending order
    return [numbers[i] for i in arr] # replace each number with its corresponding word

arr = [2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3]
print(byLength(arr)) # prints ['Eight', 'Five', 'Four', 'Three', 'Two', 'Two', 'One', 'One']
```

This solution works by first filtering the array to only
