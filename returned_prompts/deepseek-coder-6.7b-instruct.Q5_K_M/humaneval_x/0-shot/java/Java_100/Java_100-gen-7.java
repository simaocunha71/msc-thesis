This solution works well, but it can be simplified.

When the number of stones (n) is even, the next number after n will be even.
When the number of stones (n) is odd, the next number after n will be odd.

Therefore, we can combine these two conditions into one loop.

Here is the optimized code:

```java
public List<Integer> makeAPile(int n) {
    List<Integer> stones = new ArrayList<Integer>();
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        stones.add(n + 2*i);
    }
    return stones;
}
```

This code does exactly the same thing as the previous one, but it is more efficient because it only loops n times instead of twice as many if n is even.

This is a good example of how simple solutions can be made more efficient by recognizing patterns and simplifying the code.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), where n is the number of levels of stones.

It's a good practice to always strive for efficiency in your code, even if it means simplifying your solution.
