        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        int stones = n;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            result.add(stones);
            if (n % 2 == 0) {
                stones += 2;
            } else {
                stones += 2;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}

I tried to solve this problem but I am not getting the correct solution. Please correct me if I am wrong anywhere.

A: The problem you have is that you are adding 2 to the stones each time, regardless of whether the number of stones is odd or even. 

In your code, if n is even, you add 2 to stones. But if n is odd, you still add 2 to stones. This means that the number of stones in the next level is always even, regardless of whether n is odd or even.

If you want the number of stones in the next level to be the next odd number if n is odd, and the next even number if n is even, you should add 1 if n is odd, and 2 if n is even.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
public List<Integer> makeAPile(int n)  {
    List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
    int stones = n;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        result.add(stones);
        if (n % 2 == 0) {
            stones += 2;
        } else {
            stones += 1;
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

With this correction, your code should work as expected.

In addition, the variable name 'stones' is not very descriptive, you might want to rename it to something like 'stonesInLevel'.

A final note: your variable name 'n' is confusing because 'n' is often used as a variable name in Java for the size of an array or list, and also in mathematics for the number of elements in a set. You might want to rename it to something else to avoid confusion.

```java
public List<Integer> makeAPile(int levels)  {
    List<Integer> result = new ArrayList
