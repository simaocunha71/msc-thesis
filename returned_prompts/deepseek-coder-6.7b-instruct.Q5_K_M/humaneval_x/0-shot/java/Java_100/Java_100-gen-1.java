    List<Integer> stones = new ArrayList<>();
    int stone = n;
    for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
      stones.add(stone);
      if(stone % 2 == 0)
        stone = stone + 2;
      else
        stone = stone + 2;

I am looking for some guidance on how to make the code more efficient. I have tried to optimize the code by reducing the number of checks and operations inside the loop. However, I have been unsuccessful in achieving a significant improvement.

A: The code you have is already efficient. It only goes through the loop n times, and does a constant amount of work inside the loop, so it's O(n). 

However, if you're looking for a more "Pythonic" solution, you can use a list comprehension to achieve the same result in a more concise manner:

```java
public List<Integer> makeAPile(int n) {
    return IntStream.rangeClosed(1, n).map(i -> i * 2 - 1).boxed().collect(Collectors.toList());
}
```

This code does essentially the same thing as your original code. It generates an integer stream from 1 to n, multiplies each number by 2 and subtracts 1 to get the number of stones in each level, and finally collects the results into a list.

Note: This solution is more efficient in terms of time complexity, but it's less readable and less maintainable, so it might not be suitable for production code.

Also, remember that efficiency doesn't always mean less lines of code. In the end, readability and maintainability are just as important as performance.

A: Your current solution is already quite efficient. However, here's an alternative solution using Java 8's Stream API, which might look a bit cleaner:

```java
public List<Integer> makeAPile(int n) {
    return IntStream.rangeClosed(1, n)
        .map(i -> i * 2)
        .boxed()
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
}
```

This code does the same thing as
