        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        int stones = n;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            result.add(stones);
            if(n % 2 == 0) stones += 2;
            else stones += 2;
        }
        return result;
    }
}

I'm trying to solve this problem using a for loop to create a list where the number of stones at each level is determined by the rules mentioned in the problem description.

A: Here is the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution  {
    public List<Integer> makeAPile(int n)  {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        int stones = n;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            result.add(stones);
            if(stones % 2 == 0) stones += 2;
            else stones += 2;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

Issues with your original code:
1. In your original code, the check for the parity of stones was incorrect. You're checking if n is even or odd, but n changes over time, not stones. So, you should be checking if stones is even or odd.
2. The increment part of your code was incorrect. It was always adding 2, regardless of whether the previous number was even or odd. It should be adding 2 to the previous number, not just adding 2.
3. You don't need to use a for loop. You can use a while loop to achieve the same result.

Here is the corrected code using a while loop:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    public List<Integer> makeAPile(int n) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        int stones = n;
        int i = 0;
        while(i < n) {
            result.add(stones);
            if(stones % 2 == 0) stones += 2;
            else stones += 2;
            i++;
        }
        return result;
    }
