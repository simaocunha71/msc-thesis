        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        int stones = n;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            result.add(stones);
            if(n % 2 == 0) stones += 2;
            else stones += 2;
        }
        return result;
    }
}

The problem statement is not clear about how the number of stones in the next level should increase. I am assuming that if the current level number is even, then the number of stones in the next level should be increased by 2 and if it's odd then the number of stones in the next level should be increased by 2. 

This solution adds the number of stones at each level to the result list, then increments the number of stones by 2 at each level. This will create a list of the number of stones at each level.

Please correct me if I am wrong.

A: Your logic in the for loop seems correct, but there's a minor mistake in the condition. You are checking if n is even or odd in every iteration of the loop. But n is supposed to be the number of levels. So, you need to check if i is even or odd in each iteration.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution  {
    public List<Integer> makeAPile(int n)  {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        int stones = n;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            result.add(stones);
            if(i % 2 == 0) stones += 2;
            else stones += 2;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

This solution will correctly create a list of the number of stones at each level.

Hope this helps. Let me know if you have any queries.
