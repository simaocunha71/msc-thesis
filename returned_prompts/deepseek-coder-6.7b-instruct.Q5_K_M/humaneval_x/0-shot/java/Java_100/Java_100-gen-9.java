        List<Integer> pile = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (n % 2 != 0) {
                pile.add(n + (2 * i));
            } else {
                pile.add(n + (2 * i));
            }
        }
        return pile;
    }
}

The problem with the code is that it does not handle the cases where n is even and n is odd. For n is odd, the next odd number should be added to n, and for n is even, the next even number should be added to n. So you need to replace the "n + (2 * i)" with "n + (2 * i) + (n % 2 == 0 ? 1 : 2)".

Corrected Code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution  {
    public List<Integer> makeAPile(int n) {
        List<Integer> pile = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            pile.add(n + (2 * i) + (n % 2 == 0 ? 1 : 2));
        }
        return pile;
    }
}
```


The code creates a list of integers, each representing the number of stones in each level of the pile. It uses a for loop to iterate from 0 to n-1 (inclusive), and for each iteration, it calculates the number of stones in the next level based on whether n is odd or even and adds it to the list. Finally, it returns the list of stones in each level.

The correct code should work as expected for all positive integer inputs.

In terms of time complexity, the code runs in O(n) because it performs a single operation (addition) n times. The space complexity is also O(n) because it creates a new list to store the number of stones in each level.

Please note that the problem statement seems to be missing some information that is crucial for the correct solution. For example, it doesn't specify the exact pattern for the number of stones in each level, which is crucial for the solution.
