        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            char c = s.charAt(i);
            if (Character.isUpperCase(c)) {
                sum += (int) c;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}


A: The function digitSum() takes a string s as input and returns the sum of the ASCII codes of the uppercase letters in the string.

Here's the solution:

1. Initialize a variable sum to 0.
2. Iterate over each character c in the string s.
3. If c is an uppercase letter (determined by the method isUpperCase() of the class Character), add the ASCII value of c to sum.
4. Return sum.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string s. This is because the function iterates over the string once.

The space complexity is O(1), because the function uses a constant amount of space to store the sum and the characters of the string.

This function can be useful in programming problems where you need to sum the ASCII values of uppercase letters in a string.

Here's your code:

```java
public int digitSum(String s) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
        char c = s.charAt(i);
        if (Character.isUpperCase(c)) {
            sum += (int) c;
        }
    }
    return sum;
}
```

This code works by iterating over each character in the string. If the character is uppercase (determined by the method isUpperCase()), the ASCII value of the character is added to the sum. The function then returns the sum of the ASCII values of the uppercase characters in the string.
