In this problem, we're given two strings that contain only parentheses. We have to determine whether it's possible to concatenate the two strings in some order to form a good string. A good string is one that has balanced parentheses.

Our approach is to check whether the strings are balanced. If they are, we return "Yes". If neither string is balanced, we return "Yes" because we can balance one string to make it good. If both strings are not balanced, we return "No" because we can't make either string good.

We use a stack to keep track of the open parentheses. If we encounter a closed parenthesis when the stack is empty, we return false because it means the parentheses are not balanced. If we encounter a closed parenthesis when there's an open parenthesis on the stack, we remove the open parenthesis from the stack. If we finish going through the string without finding any unbalanced parentheses, the string is balanced and we return true.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string, because we're going through the string once. The space complexity is also O(n), because in the worst case, we're pushing all the parentheses onto the stack.

In the main method, we're taking in a list
