This problem is a variation of the classic problem of parenthesis matching. The main idea is to count the number of open and close parenthesis. If we encounter a close parenthesis, we need to have an open parenthesis to match it. If we don't have any, we just count the close parenthesis. Finally, if the number of open parenthesis is more than the number of close parenthesis, it's impossible to make a good string, otherwise it's possible.

The time complexity is O(n), where n is the total number of characters in the two strings. The space complexity is O(1), because we only need a constant amount of space to store the count of open and close parenthesis.

This solution assumes that the input list contains exactly two strings. If the list can contain more than two strings, we need to modify the solution to handle that case.

This solution also assumes that the input strings only contain parenthesis. If there can be other characters in the strings, we need to modify the solution to handle that case.

Note: This solution assumes that the input strings are well-formed, i.e., they only contain valid parentheses. If the input strings can contain invalid parentheses (e.g., a close parenthesis without a matching open parenthesis), we need to add error checking to handle that case.

This solution also assumes that the input strings are non-empty. If the input strings can be empty, we need to add a special case to handle that case.

This solution assumes that the input strings are small enough to fit into memory. If the input strings are very large, we need to use a more efficient method to count the number of parent
