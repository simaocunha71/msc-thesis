        int open = 0, closed = 0;
        for (String s : lst) {
            for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
                if (c == '(')
                    open++;
                else if (c == ')')
                    closed++;
            }

        return (open == closed) ? "Yes" : "No";

A: The idea of this solution is to count the number of open and closed parentheses in each of the given strings. If the number of open parentheses equals the number of closed parentheses, then it's possible to form a "good" string because we can close all open parentheses. If not, then it's not possible to form a "good" string.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the total number of parentheses in both strings. This is because we iterate through each character of each string once. 

The space complexity is O(1), because we only use a constant amount of space to store the counts of open and closed parentheses, regardless of the size of the input.

Here is the Java code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(matchParens(Arrays.asList("()(", ")")));  // Output: Yes
        System.out.println(matchParens(Arrays.asList(")", ")")));  // Output: No
    }

    static String matchParens(List<String> lst) {
        int open = 0, closed = 0;
        for (String s : lst) {
            for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
                if (c == '(')
                    open++;
                else if (c == ')')
                    closed++;
            }
        }
        return (open == closed) ? "Yes" : "No";
    }
}
```

This code will print "Yes" if it's possible to concatenate the strings in a way that the resulting string is good, and "No" otherwise.
