    String vowels = "aeiouAEIOU";
    int length = word.length();
    for (int i = length - 2; i > 0; i--) {
        if (vowels.contains(Character.toString(word.charAt(i))) &&
            !vowels.contains(Character.toString(word.charAt(i - 1))) &&
            !vowels.contains(Character.toString(word.charAt(i + 1)))) {
            return Character.toString(word.charAt(i));
        }
    }
    return "";
}

This code will iterate from the end of the word and will check if the character at position i is a vowel and the characters before and after are not. If it is, it will return the character. If no such character is found, it will return an empty string.

The time complexity of this code is O(n) where n is the length of the word. This is because it iterates over the word from the end to the start. The space complexity is O(1) because it uses a constant amount of space to store the vowels string and the length of the word.

The code is correct and should work as expected.

The code is also efficient and should have a good performance.

It's important to note that the function will return the closest vowel from the right side of the word that is surrounded by consonants, not the one that is closest in terms of the number of consonants between them.

Also, the function is case sensitive, so it will treat uppercase and lowercase letters differently.
