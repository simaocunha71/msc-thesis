                !vowels.contains(Character.toString(word.charAt(i+1)))) {

A: The provided solution is correct. It scans the string from right to left and checks if the character is a vowel and its neighbors are not vowels. If the condition is met, it adds the character to the result and breaks the loop. 

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string. The space complexity is O(1), since it uses a constant amount of space.

The code is efficient and works as expected. The provided examples give correct results.

Here is the code again for reference:

```java
public String getClosestVowel(String word) {
    String vowels = "AEIOUaeiou";
    StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
    for(int i = word.length()-2; i > 0; i--) {
        if(vowels.contains(Character.toString(word.charAt(i))) &&
