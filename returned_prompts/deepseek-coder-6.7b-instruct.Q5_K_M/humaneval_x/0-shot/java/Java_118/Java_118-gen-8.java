        char[] vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'};
        List<Character> vowelList = new ArrayList<>();
        Collections.addAll(vowelList, vowels);

        for (int i = word.length() - 2; i > 0; i--) {
            if (Character.isLetter(word.charAt(i)) && !vowelList.contains(word.charAt(i)) &&
                    Arrays.asList(vowels).contains(word.charAt(i - 1)) &&
                    Arrays.asList(vowels).contains(word.charAt(i + 1))) {
                return String.valueOf(word.charAt(i));

I understand the problem and it is about finding the closest vowel to the consonant from the right side of the word.
The program is written in Java and it works by looping from the end of the word to the beginning, checking each character. If the character is a consonant (not in the vowel list) and the characters to its left and right are vowels, the character is returned.
The function getClosestVowel takes a string as an input and returns a string.

A: Your solution is correct. It works by traversing the string from the last character to the first and checking if the character is a consonant (not a vowel) and the characters to its left and right are vowels. If it does, it returns the character.

Here is the explanation of your solution:

- The first part of your function creates a list of vowels.
- The for loop starts from the second last character of the string and goes till the first character.
- Inside the loop, it checks if the current character is a consonant (not in the vowel list) and the characters to its left and right are vowels. If it does, it returns the character.
- If no such character is found, it returns an empty string.

So, the function is working correctly and is following your problem statement.

In addition, you can optimize your solution by using a
