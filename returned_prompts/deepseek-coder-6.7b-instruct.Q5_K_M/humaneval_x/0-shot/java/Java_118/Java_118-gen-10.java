        for (int i = word.length() - 2; i > 0; i--) {
            if (vowels.contains(word.charAt(i)) && !vowels.contains(word.charAt(i - 1)) && !vowels.contains(word.charAt(i + 1))) {
                closestVowel = String.valueOf(word.charAt(i));

The solution provided is correct, and it goes through each character of the input string from the right side to the left side, checking if it is a vowel and if the characters to the left and right are not vowels. If it finds such a character, it breaks the loop and returns it. If it doesn't find any such character, it returns an empty string.

The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because the solution scans the string from right to left only once. The space complexity is O(1), as it uses a constant amount of space.

The solution assumes that the input string contains only English letters and does not contain any special characters
