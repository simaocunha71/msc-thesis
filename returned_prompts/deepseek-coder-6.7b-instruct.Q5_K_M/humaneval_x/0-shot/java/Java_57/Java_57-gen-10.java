The code works by first counting the number of elements in the list that are in increasing order. If this count equals the size of the list minus 1 (since the last element can't be compared to anything), then the list is monotonically increasing, and the function returns true.

If the count is not equal to the size of the list minus 1, then the list is not monotonically increasing, and the function proceeds to count the number of elements that are in decreasing order. If this count equals the size of the list minus 1, then the list is monotonically decreasing, and the function returns true.

If neither of these conditions are met, the function returns false, indicating that the list is not monotonically increasing or decreasing.

It's worth noting that this solution assumes that the input list is not empty. If the list can be empty, additional checks would need to be added to handle this case.

Also, this solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the list. This is because it needs to iterate over the list twice.

Please note that the above code is written in Java. If you want the solution in any other programming language, please let me know.

Thank you for your attention to this question.
