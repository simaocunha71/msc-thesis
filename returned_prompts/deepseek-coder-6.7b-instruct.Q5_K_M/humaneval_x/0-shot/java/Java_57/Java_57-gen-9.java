A: The solution provided by you is correct, but it can be simplified a bit.

We only need to check if the list is sorted in ascending order, descending order or if it is not sorted at all and return false in that case.

Here is the optimized code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution  {
    public boolean monotonic(List<Integer> l) {
        for (int i = 1; i < l.size(); i++) {
            if (l.get(i-1) > l.get(i)) {
                if (i + 1 < l.size() && l.get(i-1) > l.get(i+1)) {
                    return false;
                }
            } else if (l.get(i-1) < l.get(i)) {
                if (i + 1 < l.size() && l.get(i-1) < l.get(i+1)) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

In this solution, we are only checking the current element and the next one. If the current element is greater than the next one, we assume the list is in descending order. Conversely, if the current element is less than the next one, we assume the list is in ascending order. If the next element is not in the same order, we return false immediately. If we have gone through the whole list without finding any discrepancies, we return true.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the size of the list.

This solution is more efficient than the previous one as it avoids unnecessary comparisons and checks only the current and next elements of the list
