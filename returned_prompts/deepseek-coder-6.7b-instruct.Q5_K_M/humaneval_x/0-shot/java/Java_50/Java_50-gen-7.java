    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        String original = "hello";
        String encoded = solution.encodeShift(original);
        String decoded = solution.decodeShift(encoded);
        System.out.println("Original: " + original);

}

The program above defines a class, Solution, which contains two methods: encodeShift and decodeShift. encodeShift takes a string as input and returns a string where every character is shifted 5 positions to the right in the alphabet. decodeShift takes an encoded string as input and returns the original string.

The program then creates an instance of the Solution class, calls the encodeShift method on the string "hello", and stores the result in the variable encoded. It then calls the decodeShift method on the encoded string and stores the result in the variable decoded. Finally, it prints the original string, the encoded string, and the decoded string to the console.

Note: This code assumes that the input string only contains lowercase letters and does not handle non-letter characters. If you need to handle non-letter characters, you will need to modify the code to handle them correctly.

Also, the code uses the modulo operator (%) to handle the wrapping of the alphabet. For example, if the character 'z' is shifted 5 positions to the right, it wraps around to the beginning of the alphabet and becomes 'e'.

The main method is the entry point of the program. It creates an instance of the Solution class, calls the encodeShift method on the string "hello", and stores the result in the variable encoded. It then calls the decodeShift method on the encoded string and stores the result in the variable decoded. Finally, it prints the original string, the encoded string, and the decoded string to the console.
