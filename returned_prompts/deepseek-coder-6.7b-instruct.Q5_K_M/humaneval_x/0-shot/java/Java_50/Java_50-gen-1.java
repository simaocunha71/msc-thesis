        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for  (char ch : s.toCharArray())  {
            sb.append((char) ('a' + ((ch - 5 - 'a' + 26) % 26)));
        }
        return sb.toString();
     }

The `encodeShift` function works by iterating over every character in the input string, shifting it forward by 5 in the alphabet using the modulus operator to wrap around to the start of the alphabet if necessary. The `decodeShift` function does the same, but in the opposite direction by subtracting 5 instead of adding.

This code assumes all input characters are lowercase and are within the range of the English alphabet. If this is not the case, you'll need to add additional error checking or adjust the code to handle other characters.

Also, this is a simple Caesar cipher, and it's not secure for any serious use. It's just for fun and for learning about character manipulation in Java.

If you want to use a more secure method of encoding and decoding, you should use a more complex algorithm, like a symmetric key cipher.


This code may not work as expected for the following cases:

1. Characters other than English alphabet
2. Uppercase letters
3. Characters with ASCII values less than 32
4. Characters with ASCII values greater than 126

In such cases, you need to modify the code to handle them according to your specific needs.


## Cryptography in Java

- **Cipher** : 

The Cipher interface provides the capability to encrypt and decrypt data. It has two sub-interfaces - `SecretKey` and `AlgorithmParameterSpec`.

- **SecretKey** : 

It is used to encapsulate a secret key which can be used for encryption and decryption.

- **AlgorithmParameterSpec** : 

It is used to specify the parameters of the encryption algorithm.

- **KeyGenerator** : 

It is used to generate secret keys for the encryption and decryption.

- **IvParameterSpec** : 

It is used to specify the Initialization Vector (IV) for the AES algorithm.
