        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for  (char ch : s.toCharArray()){
            sb.append((char) ('a' + ((ch - 5 - 'a' + 26) % 26)));
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}

Here's the solution:

The `encodeShift` function works by adding 5 to the ASCII value of each character in the string, then taking the modulus of 26 to ensure that we wrap around to the start of the alphabet if we go past 'z'.

The `decodeShift` function works by subtracting 5 from the ASCII value of each character in the string, then taking the modulus of 26 to ensure that we wrap around to 'z' if we go below 'a'.

The modulus operation is used to wrap around the alphabet, so for example 'z' plus 1 is 'a', 'y' plus 1 is 'z', and so on. The 26 in the modulus operation ensures that we wrap around to the start of the alphabet.

The 5 in the encodeShift and decodeShift functions are the amount by which each character is shifted. This can be any number, and the encodeShift and decodeShift functions can be used with any number. The 5 in this case is just a placeholder value, and you could change it to any number you like.

Note: This solution assumes that all characters in the string are lower case letters from 'a' to 'z'. If the string contains upper case letters or other characters, the solution will not work correctly.

Also, the solution uses the modulus operator to wrap around the alphabet. This is equivalent to adding or subtracting 26 until the value is within the range of lowercase letters 'a' to 'z'. The modulus operator is used to ensure that the result is within the range of lowercase letters 'a' to 'z'.

The solution also uses the StringBuilder class to build the encoded and decoded strings. The StringBuilder class is more efficient than using string concatenation in a loop, because it avoids creating a new string for each concatenation.

This solution is case-sensitive and does not handle non-alphabetic characters. If you need to handle these cases, you will need to
