I:
The code given above works perfectly. It encodes the given string by shifting every character by 5 places in the alphabet in the encodeShift function and decodes the encoded string in the decodeShift function.

The encoding and decoding process are done by using the modulo operation (%). This operation ensures that the character wraps around to the start of the alphabet when it reaches 'z'.

The encoding and decoding process is done by adding and subtracting 5 respectively from the ASCII values of the characters.

The modulo operation is used to handle the case where the character is 'z' and it needs to wrap around to 'a'.

The main function tests the encodeShift and decodeShift functions by encoding a string and then decoding the encoded string. The result is printed to the console.

The time complexity of the encodeShift and decodeShift functions is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because they each iterate over the input string once. The space complexity is also O(n) as they both create a new StringBuilder object to build the encoded/decoded string.

The code is written in Java and is designed to be run in a Java environment.

The code assumes that the input string is in lower case and consists only of alphabetic characters. If this is not the case, the code may not work as expected.

The code does not handle any exceptions that might occur, so it is assumed that the input will be valid.

The code is well-commented and follows good coding practices. The functions are modular
