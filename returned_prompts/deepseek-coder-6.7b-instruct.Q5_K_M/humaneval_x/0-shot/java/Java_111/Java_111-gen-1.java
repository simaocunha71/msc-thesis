A: You're on the right track with your solution. However, the problem statement specifically asks for a dictionary, which is a type of associative array in Python, and a Map in Java.

In Python, you could solve the problem as follows:

```python
def histogram(test):
    result = {}
    for letter in test.split():
        if letter in result:
            result[letter] += 1
        else:
            result[letter] = 1
    max_count = max(result.values())
    return {key: value for key, value in result.items() if value == max_count}
```

In this code, we iterate over each letter in the string, and if the letter is already in our result dictionary, we increment its count. If it's not in the dictionary, we add it with a count of 1. Then, we find the maximum count and return a new dictionary that only contains the entries with that maximum count.


A: Your solution is correct. However, you can optimize your code by removing the second loop that checks the maximum count.

Here's the optimized Java code:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public Map<String, Integer> histogram(String test) {
        Map<String, Integer> result = new HashMap<>();
