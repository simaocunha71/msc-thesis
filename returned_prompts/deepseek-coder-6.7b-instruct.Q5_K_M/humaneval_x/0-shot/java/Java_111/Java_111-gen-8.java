The given solution works by splitting the given string into words and then for each word it checks if it already exists in the map. If it exists, it increases the count by 1. If it doesn't exist, it adds the word to the map with a count of 1.

Then it finds the maximum count and then it again goes through the map to find all the words that have the maximum count and adds them to the result map. The result map is then returned.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) as we are iterating through the string once to split it and then iterating through the words in the map once to find the max count and iterate through the words again to find the words with the max count. The space complexity is also O(n) as in the worst case scenario we could have n different words in the map.

The code is correct and follows the problem statement. It also handles the edge case of an empty string correctly.

This solution is correct and efficient.
