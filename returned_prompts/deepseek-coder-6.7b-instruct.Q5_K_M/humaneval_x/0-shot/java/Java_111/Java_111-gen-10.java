This solution takes a string and splits it into words. It then iterates through each word, checking if it's in the dictionary. If it is, it increments the count by 1, if not, it adds the word to the dictionary with a count of 1.

Then it iterates through the dictionary to find the max count.

Finally, it iterates through the dictionary again, adding any words with the max count to the result dictionary.

Then it returns the result dictionary.

Note: This solution assumes that the string contains only lowercase letters and spaces. If this is not the case, the solution would need to be modified to handle the additional cases.

A: You can use a HashMap to keep track of the frequency of each character in the string. Then you can iterate over the HashMap to find the character(s) with the highest frequency. Here is a simple Java code:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(histogram("a b c")); // {"a": 1,  "b": 1,  "c": 1}
        System.out.println(histogram("a b b a")); // {"a": 2,  "b": 2}
