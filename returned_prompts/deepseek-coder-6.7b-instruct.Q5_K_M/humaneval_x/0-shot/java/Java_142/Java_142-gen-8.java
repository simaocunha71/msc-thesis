Test:
import java.util.*;

class Main  {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution s = new Solution();

        List<Integer> lst = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(1,2,3));
        System.out.println(s.sumSquares(lst)); // output: 6

        lst = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList());
        System.out.println(s.sumSquares(lst)); // output: 0

        lst = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(-1,-5,2,-1,-5));
        System.out.println(s.sumSquares(lst)); // output: -126
    }
}

This solution first initializes a variable sum to 0. Then it iterates through the list lst. If the index i is a multiple of 3, it squares the element at that index and adds it to sum. If the index i is a multiple of 4 but not a multiple of 3, it cubes the element at that index and adds it to sum. If the index i is not a multiple of 3 or 4, it adds the element at that index to sum without changing it. Finally, it returns sum.

The tests verify the function with the provided examples and with an empty list.

Please note that the problem statement is not entirely clear. The examples given do not match the conditions given in the problem, as the first example is index 0-based (which is a multiple of 3) and the second example is an empty list. The third example also has indices that are multiples of 3 and 4, so it may not behave as expected depending on whether the problem statement
