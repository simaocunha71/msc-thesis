This solution works by looping through each integer in the list and checking if its index is a multiple of 3 or 4, but not a multiple of 4. If it is, we square the integer and add it to the sum. If the index is a multiple of 4, we cube the integer and add it to the sum. If the index is not a multiple of 3 or 4, we simply add the integer to the sum. The result is returned at the end.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the size of the list. This is because we are looping through each element in the list once. The space complexity is O(1), as we are not using any additional space that scales with the size of the input.

The function takes a list of integers and returns an integer. It uses a for loop to iterate over the list. Inside the loop, it checks if the index is a multiple of 3 or 4, but not a multiple of 4. If it is, it squares the number and adds it to the sum. If the index is a multiple of 4, it cubes the number and adds it to the sum. If the index is not a multiple of 3 or 4, it simply adds the number to the sum. Finally, it returns the sum.
