I am assuming that the question is to find the smallest even number and its index in the list. 

The problem can be solved using a single pass through the list. We keep track of the smallest even number we have seen so far and its index.

Here is the Java code for the problem:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> arr = Arrays.asList(5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2);
        List<Integer> result = pluck(arr);
        System.out.println(result);  // Output: [0, 1]
    }

    public static List<Integer> pluck(List<Integer> arr) {
        int minEven = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int minIndex = -1;

        for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
            if (arr.get(i) %
