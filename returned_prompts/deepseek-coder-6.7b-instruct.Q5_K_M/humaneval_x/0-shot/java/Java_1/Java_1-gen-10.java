A: Here is the solution for the problem. 
The solution is based on using a stack data structure to keep track of parentheses. Whenever we encounter an opening parenthesis, we push it into the stack. When we encounter a closing parenthesis, we pop the element from the stack. 
If the stack becomes empty, it indicates that we have found a separate group of parentheses. We then add this group to the result list and update the start index to the next character after the found group.

In the provided solution:
- We initialize an empty stack.
- Then we iterate over the input string.
- For each character, if it's an opening parenthesis, we push it into the stack.
- If it's a closing parenthesis, we pop an element from the stack.
- If the stack becomes empty, it means we have found a separate group of parentheses. We then add this group to the result list.
- Finally, we return the result list.

Please note that this solution assumes that the input string is well-formed (i.e., it contains balanced parentheses). If the input string can contain unbalanced parentheses, you would need to handle that case in your code.

Also, this solution doesn't handle spaces in the input string. If you want to ignore spaces in the input string, you can add a line of code to remove spaces before processing the string.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<String> separateParen
