A: Here's the explanation of the code.

*

*We initialize an empty list result and a stack.

*We iterate through each character in the input string.

*If the character is '(' or a space, we push it onto the stack and add it to the StringBuilder.

*If the character is ')', we pop it from the stack and add it to the StringBuilder.

*If the stack is empty, this means we have found a complete group of parentheses. We add the current StringBuilder contents to the result list and reset the StringBuilder.

*Finally, we return the result list.

This solution assumes that the input string is well-formed (i.e., every open parenthesis has a corresponding close parenthesis). If there can be unbalanced parentheses, we would need to handle that case separately.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because we are making a single pass through the input string. The space complexity is also O(n), because in the worst case (when there are no nested parentheses groups), we will store every character in the input string in the result list.

In the provided example, the function returns ["()", "(())", "(()())"], which is the expected output.
