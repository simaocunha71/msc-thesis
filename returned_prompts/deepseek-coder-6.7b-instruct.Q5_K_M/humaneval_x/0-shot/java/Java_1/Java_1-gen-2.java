The problem is to separate the balanced parenthesis groups from the input string.

Given that the parentheses are balanced, we can use a stack to keep track of the parentheses. We will iterate through the input string, and for each character, if it is an opening parenthesis, we will push it into the stack, and if it is a closing parenthesis, we will pop it from the stack. 

We will add the character to a string builder for each parenthesis, and when the stack is empty, we will add the string builder to the result list, and reset the string builder for the next group of parentheses.

Here is the Java code for the problem:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public List<String> separateParenGroups(String s) {
        List<String> res = new ArrayList<>();
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == '(') {
                stack.push(c);
                sb.append(c);
            } else {
                stack.pop();
                sb.append(c);
                if (stack.isEmpty()) {
                    res.add(sb.toString());
                    sb.setLength(0);
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

This code works by iterating through the input string and using a stack to keep track of the parentheses. If a parenthesis
