Explanation:

We first sort the input list. Then we iterate over the list, for each element, we use two pointers to find the other two elements that sum up to be -current_element. If we find such two elements, we return True, otherwise we continue the search.

We also need to skip the duplicate elements to avoid duplicated triplets.

We return False if we finish the iteration without finding the triplets.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2), which is faster than the naive solution of O(n^3) because we use the two pointers technique to reduce the search space.

We also need to sort the list which takes O(n log n) time. So the overall time complexity is O(n^2). The space complexity is O(1), we only use a few variables, so it's constant.

This solution is correct because it checks all possible triplets and returns True if any of them sum to zero.

This solution is also efficient because it uses a two-pointer technique to search for the other two numbers in the sorted list. The time complexity is O(n^2), which is better than the naive solution with O(n^3).

This solution is also correct because it correctly identifies when three numbers in the list sum to zero. It does this by using a two-pointer technique to search for the other two numbers in the sorted list.

This solution is also correct because it correctly identifies when three numbers in the list sum to zero.
