        if(isPrime(n)) {
            return x;
        } else {
            return y;
        }
    }

    public boolean isPrime(int n) {
        if(n<=1) {
            return false;
        }
        for(int i=2; i<n; i++) {
            if(n % i == 0) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}

This is a simple program that checks if a number is prime or not by iterating from 2 to n-1 and checking if n is divisible by any of these numbers. If it is, then n is not a prime number and the function returns false. If n is not divisible by any of these numbers, then it is a prime number and the function returns true.

The xOrY function checks if n is a prime number using the isPrime function and returns x if n is prime and y otherwise.

The time complexity of the isPrime function is O(n) and the time complexity of the xOrY function is O(n) as well. So, the overall time complexity of the program is O(n).

The space complexity of the program is O(1) because it uses a constant amount of space to store the variables n, x, y and i.

Please note that this program can be optimized by checking only up to the square root of n in the isPrime function because a larger factor of n must be a multiple of a smaller factor that has already been checked.

Also, please note that this program should be adapted to the specific programming language you are using. The provided code is in Java and it can be run on any Java-compatible environment.

I hope this helps, and let me know if you have any further questions.
