A: The code you posted is correct and it should work as expected.
Here's how it works:
The function isPrime checks if a number is prime by dividing it by all the numbers up to its square root. If any of those divisions has a remainder of 0, then the number is not prime. If none of them have a remainder of 0, then the number is prime.
The function xOrY checks if the input number n is prime. If n is prime, it returns x. If n is not prime, it returns y.
So if you call xOrY(7, 34, 12), it will check if 7 is prime (which it is), so it returns 34. If you call xOrY(15, 8, 5), it will check if 15 is prime (which it is not), so it returns 5.
This is a simple and efficient way to solve the problem.

A: Your solution is correct. It uses a helper function to determine if a number is prime, and then uses that function to determine the value to return based on the number's primality.

However, if you want to make it more concise, you can combine the two functions into one. Here's an example:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    public int xOrY(int n, int x, int y) {
        return isPrime(n) ? x : y;
    }

    public boolean isPrime(int n) {
        if (n <= 1) {
            return false;
        }
        for (int i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(n); i++) {
            if (n %
