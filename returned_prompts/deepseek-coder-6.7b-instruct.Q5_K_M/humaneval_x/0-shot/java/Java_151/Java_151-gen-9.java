        int sum = 0;
        for(Object i : lst){
            if(i instanceof Integer){
                int num = (int) i;
                if(num > 0 && num % 2 != 0){
                    sum += num * num;
                }
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}

The code provided is a solution for the problem. It iterates over each object in the given list and checks if it is an instance of Integer. If it is, it casts the object to an int and checks if it is positive and odd. If it is, it squares the number and adds it to the sum. Finally, it returns the sum.

In the given test cases,

1. The list [1, 3, 2, 0] contains the integers 1, 3, and 0. The squares of these numbers are 1, 9, and 0, so the sum is 10.
2. The list [-1, -2, 0] contains no positive odd integers, so the sum is 0.
3. The list [9, -2] contains the integer 9. The square of this number is 81, so the sum is 81.
4. The list [0] contains no positive odd integers, so the sum is 0.
5. If the list is empty, the sum is also 0.

So, the function works as expected.
