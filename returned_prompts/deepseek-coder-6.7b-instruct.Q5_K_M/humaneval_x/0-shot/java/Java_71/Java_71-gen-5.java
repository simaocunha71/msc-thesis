        double area = Math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c));

A: The code you provided is correct. 
The function triangleArea checks if the three sides can form a valid triangle. If they can, it calculates the semi-perimeter (s) and then uses it to calculate the area of the triangle. The area is then rounded off to 2 decimal places. If the sides cannot form a valid triangle, it returns -1.

The function Math.sqrt calculates the square root of a number. In this case, it's used to calculate the area of the triangle.

The function Math.round is used to round a number to the nearest integer. In this case, it's used to round the area to 2 decimal places.

The condition in the if statement checks if the three sides can form a valid triangle. The condition is based on the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.

Overall, the code is correct and should work as expected.

Note: The condition in the if statement should be a <= b and a <= c, not a < b and a < c. This is because the triangle inequality theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than or equal to the length of the third side.

Here is the corrected if condition:

if ((a >= b + c) || (b >= a + c) || (c >= a + b)) {
    return -1;
}
