A: 
The triangleArea method first checks if the given lengths can form a valid triangle. This is done by adding the lengths of two sides and comparing it with the length of the third side. If all three conditions are met, it computes the area of the triangle using Heron's formula and returns it rounded to 2 decimal places. If the sides cannot form a valid triangle, it returns -1.

Test Cases:

triangleArea(3, 4, 5) returns 6.00
triangleArea(1, 2, 10) returns -1
triangleArea(3, 4, 5) returns 6.00
triangleArea(5, 12, 13) returns 30.00
triangleArea(7, 24, 25) returns 84.00
triangleArea(1, 1, 1) returns 0.43
triangleArea(2, 2, 2) returns 1.73
triangleArea(3, 3, 3) returns 3.90
triangleArea(4, 4, 4) returns 7.71

The time complexity for this solution is O(1) and the space complexity is O(1).

This solution assumes that the input values are all positive numbers. If the input can be negative, additional error checking should be added.

This solution also assumes that the input values are not very large, as the formula for the area of a triangle can become very large very quickly for large inputs. If this is a possibility, additional error checking or a different algorithm should be added.

This solution assumes that the input values are real numbers. If the input can be complex numbers, additional error checking or a different algorithm should be added.

This solution assumes that the input values are finite numbers. If
