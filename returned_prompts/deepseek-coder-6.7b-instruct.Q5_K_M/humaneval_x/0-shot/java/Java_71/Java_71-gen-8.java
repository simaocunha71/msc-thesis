A: It seems you are checking the validity of the triangle using Heron's formula to calculate the area, which is correct. The code checks if the sum of any two sides of a triangle is greater than the third side, which is the criterion for a valid triangle.

If the triangle is valid, the code calculates the semi-perimeter (s = (a+b+c)/2) and then uses Heron's formula to calculate the area (area = sqrt(s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c))). The area is then rounded to two decimal places using Math.round(area * 100.0) / 100.0.

If the triangle is not valid, the code returns -1.

This code seems to be correct and should work as expected.

One thing to note is that the code assumes that the inputs a, b, and c are positive numbers. If they can be negative or zero, you would need to add additional error checking to handle those cases.

But based on the description, it seems like the inputs are always positive numbers, so no additional error checking is needed.

This code has a time complexity of O(1), as it performs a constant number of operations regardless of the input size. Its space complexity is also O(1), as it uses a constant amount of space.

So overall, this code is efficient and should work well for most practical purposes.

Note: The Math.sqrt() method used in the code returns a double value, so the result will be a double value too.


A: You're checking if the sides can form a triangle with a valid sum of lengths. If so, you're using Heron's formula to calculate the area. If not, you're returning -1.
