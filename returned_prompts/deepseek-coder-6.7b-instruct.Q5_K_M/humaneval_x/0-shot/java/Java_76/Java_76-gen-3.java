Answer:
The code provided is the correct implementation of the `isSimplePower` method. 

This method works by dividing the given number `x` by `n` in a loop until `x` becomes less than `n`. If `x` becomes 1, it means that `n` is a simple power of `x`, and the method returns true. If `x` becomes a number greater than `n`, `n` is not a simple power of `x`, and the method returns false. 

The edge cases are handled separately: if `x` is 1, it is a simple power of any number (except 1), so the method returns true. If `n` is 1, it is always a simple power of any number, so the method returns false.

The time complexity of the method is O(log x), as it performs a logarithmic number of divisions. The space complexity is O(1), as no additional space is used.

The provided test cases cover all possible cases, including negative numbers and zero.

The Main class is a simple test driver that tests the `isSimplePower` method with several test cases. It prints the result of each test
