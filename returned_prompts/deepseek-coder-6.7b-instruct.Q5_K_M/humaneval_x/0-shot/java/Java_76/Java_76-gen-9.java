        if (x == 1) {
            return true;
        }
        if (n > x || n <= 0) {
            return false;
        }
        while (x % n == 0) {
            x /= n;
        }
        return x == 1;
    }
}

This is a solution in Java. The function `isSimplePower` checks whether `n` raised to any integer power equals `x`. If `n` is greater than `x`, the function immediately returns `false`, as `n` cannot raise itself to a power that equals `x`. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the function also returns `false`, as powers of 0 or negative numbers are not defined.

In the while loop, the function repeatedly divides `x` by `n` while `x` is divisible by `n`. After this loop, if `x` is 1, then `n` raised to some integer power equals `x`, and the function returns `true`. If `x` is not 1, then `n` raised to some integer power does not equal `x`, and the function returns `false`.

For example, `isSimplePower(8, 2)` returns `true` because 2 raised to the power of 3 equals 8. Similarly, `isSimplePower(3, 2)` returns `false` because 2 raised to the power of 2 equals 4, not 3.
