A: The program is almost correct. It checks each character in the string and if it's a vowel, it increments the count. It also checks if the string ends with 'y' (ignoring case), if it does, it increments the count by 1.

The only thing that can be improved is the condition inside the if statement in the for loop. It's checking if the character is a vowel, but it can be simplified to just checking if the character is in a string of vowels. 

Here is the improved code:

```java
public int vowelsCount(String s) {
    int count = 0;
    String lowerCase = s.toLowerCase();
    String vowels = "aeiou";
    for(int i = 0; i < lowerCase.length(); i++){
        char letter = lowerCase.charAt(i);
        if(vowels.indexOf(letter) != -1){
            count++;
        }
    }
    if(lowerCase.endsWith("y")){
        count++;
    }
    return count;
}
```

In this version, the indexOf method is used to check if the character is in the string of vowels. If it is, the count is incremented. The if statement at the end still checks if the string ends with 'y', and if it does, it increments the count by 1.

The time complexity of this version is O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because it goes through each character in the string once.

The space complexity of this version is O(1), because it uses a fixed amount of space to store the count and the string
