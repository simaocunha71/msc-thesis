This code firstly finds the largest prime number in the list. After that, it calculates the sum of the digits of this prime number and returns the result.

In the code snippet, isPrime(int num) method is used to check whether the number is a prime number or not. If the number is less than 2, it returns false. Then it checks for divisors from 2 to sqrt(num). If the number is divisible by any of these numbers, it returns false. If the number is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is a prime number and it returns true.

The sumOfDigits(int num) method is used to calculate the sum of the digits of a number. It keeps dividing the number by 10 and adding the remainder to the sum until the number is 0. Finally, it returns the sum of the digits.

In the main method, it iterates over the list and checks each number. If the number is a prime number and greater than the current maxPrime, it updates the maxPrime. After the loop, it returns the sum of the digits of the maxPrime.

Note: The names of the methods are not as per the question statement, so I have renamed them to match the logic of the code.
