    // Define roman numeral symbols and their corresponding values
    vals := []int{1000, 900, 500, 400, 100, 90, 50, 40, 10, 9, 5, 4, 1}
    syms := []string{"m", "cm", "d", "cd", "c", "xc", "l", "xl", "x", "ix", "v", "iv", "i"}

    // Initialize result string
    result := ""

    // Loop through each value in vals
    for i, v := range vals {
        // As long as the number is greater than or equal to the current value,
        // append the corresponding symbol to the result and subtract the value from the number
        for number >= v {
            result += syms[i]
            number -= v
        }
    }

    // Return the result
    return result
}

In the above Python code, we first define the symbols and their corresponding values. We then initialize the result string. We loop through each value in the values list, and as long as the number is greater than or equal to the current value, we append the corresponding symbol to the result and subtract the value from the number. Finally, we return the result.

In the Go code, we do essentially the same thing. We define the symbols and their corresponding values, initialize the result string, and then loop through each value in the values slice. As long as the number is greater than or equal to the current value, we append the corresponding symbol to the result and subtract the value from the number. Finally, we return the result.

Both codes produce the same output for the same input, so they can be used interchangeably.

Note: The Go code uses a range loop to iterate over the vals slice, which automatically assigns the index and value of each element to the variables i and v, respectively.

Also, it's worth mentioning that this code assumes that the input number is a positive integer and within the specified range (1 <= num <= 1000). If the input is outside this range, the code may not work as expected.
