            if(s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(i+1) || s.charAt(i+1) == s.charAt(i+2) || s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(i+2)) {

The above code checks if the string is happy by iterating through the string and checking if any two characters are the same. If so, it returns false. If no such characters are found after checking all pairs of characters in the string, it returns true, indicating that the string is happy.

The time complexity of the code is O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because the code makes a single pass over the string. The space complexity is O(1), as the code does not use any additional space that scales with the size of the input string.

The function will return true if the string is happy (i.e., if no three consecutive characters are the same), and false otherwise.

The function assumes that the string only contains lowercase letters and does not contain any punctuation or digits.

The code does not handle any exceptions that might be thrown by the charAt method or any other method calls. It does not check the input string for validity in any other way.
