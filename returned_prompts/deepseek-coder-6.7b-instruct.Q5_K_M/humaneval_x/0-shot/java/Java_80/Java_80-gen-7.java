The solution provided by the user is correct but it doesn't take into account the case sensitivity. If the characters are not the same it should be return false. 

Here is the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution  {
    /**
    You are given a string s.
    Your task is to check if the string is happy or not.
    A string is happy if its length is at least 3 and every 3 consecutive letters are distinct
    For example:
    isHappy(a) => false
    isHappy(aa) => false
    isHappy(abcd) => true
    isHappy(aabb) => false
    isHappy(adb) => true
    isHappy(xyy) => false
      */
    public boolean isHappy(String s)  {

        if (s.length() < 3) {
            return false;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length() - 2; i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(i + 1) || s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(i + 2) || s.charAt(i + 1) == s.charAt(i + 2)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

This solution works by iterating over the string and checking if the current character is the same as the next two characters. If it is, the function returns false. If it iterates over the entire string without finding any matching characters, it returns true.
