    int largestIndex = -1;
    for (int i = 1; i < arr.size(); i++) {
        if (arr.get(i) < arr.get(i - 1)) {
            largestIndex = i;
        }
    }
    return largestIndex;

    }
}


A: Your code is almost correct. You just have to find the last element that is less than its previous element. Here is the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    public int canArrange(List<Integer> arr) {
        for (int i = arr.size() - 1; i > 0; i--) {
            if (arr.get(i) < arr.get(i - 1)) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```

In this code, we start from the end of the array and go to the beginning. If we find an element that is less than its previous one, we return the index. If we don't find such an element, we return -1.

Note: This solution assumes that the input array will always contain at least one element. If the input array can be empty, you should add a check for this case at the beginning of the function.

Test the function:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Solution sol = new Solution();
    System.out.println(sol.canArrange(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 4, 3, 5)));  // Outputs: 3
    System.out.println(sol.canArrange(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3)));  // Outputs: -1
}
```

This code will print the expected output for the given examples.

Note: The original question statement is not clear about the requirement of the function. If the requirement is to find the first element from the end that is less than its previous one, you should start from the end instead of the beginning.
