        int largestIndex = -1;

        for (int i = 1; i < arr.size(); i++) {
            if (arr.get(i) < arr.get(i-1)) {
                largestIndex = i;
            }
        }

        return largestIndex;
    }
}

Here is the solution to the problem. The problem is to find the largest index of an element which is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. If no such element exists, return -1. 

The function canArrange iterates through the array from the second element to the end. If it finds an element that is smaller than the previous one, it updates the largestIndex variable to the current index. At the end of the function, it returns the largestIndex.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the size of the array. The space complexity is O(1), as it only uses a single variable to store the largest index.
