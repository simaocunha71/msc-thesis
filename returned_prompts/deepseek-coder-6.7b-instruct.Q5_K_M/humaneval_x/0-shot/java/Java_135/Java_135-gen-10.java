        int index = -1;
        for (int i = arr.size() - 1; i > 0; i--) {
            if (arr.get(i) < arr.get(i-1)) {
                index = i;
                break;
            }
        }
        return index;
    }
}


A: The problem is asking to find the largest index of an element in the array which is smaller than its previous element. If no such element exists, then return -1.

Here's the solution:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int canArrange(List<Integer> arr) {
        int largestIndex = -1;
        for (int i = arr.size() - 1; i > 0; i--) {
            if (arr.get(i) < arr.get(i - 1)) {
                largestIndex = i;
            }
        }
        return largestIndex;
    }
}
```

This solution iterates from the end of the array to the start, checking each element to see if it's smaller than the previous one. If it is, it sets `largestIndex` to the current index and breaks the loop. Finally, it returns `largestIndex`.

For example, for the input `[1, 2, 4, 3, 5]`, the largest index of an element not greater than or equal to its previous element is 3, so the function returns 3. For the input `[1, 2, 3]`, no such element exists, so the function returns -1.

This solution assumes that the input list will not contain duplicate values. If there could be duplicates, the solution would need to be modified to handle that.
