        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (arr.get(i) < arr.get(i-1)) {
                maxIndex = Math.max(maxIndex, i);

A: Here is the solution in Python:

def canArrange(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    if n == 0: return -1

    maxIndex = -1

    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] < arr[i-1]:
            maxIndex = max(maxIndex, i)

    return maxIndex

In this Python solution, the function canArrange() takes a list of integers as input. It then goes through each element in the list, starting from the second element. If the current element is less than the previous one, it updates the variable maxIndex to the current index. After going through all elements, it returns the maxIndex. If the maxIndex is not updated (which means there is no such element), it returns -1.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the list. This is because it goes through each element in the list once.

And here is the solution in Java:

public int canArrange(List<Integer> arr) {
    int n = arr.size();
    if (n == 0) return -1;

    int maxIndex = -1;

    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr.get(i) < arr.get(i-1)) {
            maxIndex = Math.max(maxIndex, i);
        }
    }

    return maxIndex;
}

The Java solution is very similar to the Python solution. It also has a time complexity of O(n).

Both solutions have the same time complexity because they each go through each element in the list exactly once. They have a time complexity of O(n) because in the worst case scenario, they have to go through all elements in
