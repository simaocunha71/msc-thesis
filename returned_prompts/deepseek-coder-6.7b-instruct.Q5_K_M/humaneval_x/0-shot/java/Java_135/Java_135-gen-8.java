        int maxIndex = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.size() - 1; i++) {
            if (arr.get(i) < arr.get(i + 1)) {
                maxIndex = Math.max(maxIndex, i + 1);
            }
        }
        return maxIndex;
    }
}

This solution iterates through the array from the first element to the penultimate one. For each pair of adjacent elements, if the current element is less than the next one, then the current element's index is compared with `maxIndex` and the larger one is stored in `maxIndex`.

If no such pair of elements is found, `maxIndex` will remain as -1 and that is the result returned.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the array, because it only scans through the array once. The space complexity is O(1), as no additional space is used.

Please note that the problem statement is somewhat unclear. The example provided indicates that the function should return the index of the largest element that is less than the next one, not the index of the last such element. In the case of the provided example, 5 is the last such element and its index is 4, not 3.

If the problem statement is indeed to find the last such element, then the solution should be modified to start from the last element and go backwards, comparing each element with the previous one.

The time complexity of this modified solution is also O(n), but the space complexity is O(1) because no additional space is used.

Please let me know if you meant to ask about the last such element.
