    // Define a helper method to count the number of ones in the binary representation of a number.
    private int countOnes(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            count += n % 2;
            n /= 2;
        }
        return count;
    }

    // Use the Collections.sort method with a custom Comparator.
    Collections.sort(arr, new Comparator<Integer>() {
        @Override
        public int compare(Integer n1, Integer n2) {
            int count1 = countOnes(n1);
            int count2 = countOnes(n2);
            // If the counts are equal, sort based on the decimal values.
            return count1 != count2 ? count1 - count2 : n1 - n2;
        }
    });
    return arr;


}

This solution works by using the Collections.sort method with a custom Comparator. The custom Comparator first compares the numbers based on the number of ones in their binary representation. If the numbers have the same number of ones, it then compares the decimal values of the numbers.

The helper method countOnes is used to count the number of ones in the binary representation of a number. It does this by repeatedly dividing the number by 2 and adding the remainder to a count.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) because the Collections.sort method has a time complexity of O(n log n). This is because the Comparator used in the sorting operation has a time complexity of O(1) for each comparison, and there are n comparisons in the sorting operation.

The space complexity of this solution is O(n) because the sorting operation creates a new list that contains the elements of the input list in sorted order. The size of this new list is the same as the size of the input list.

The solution also handles negative numbers correctly because the countOnes method works correctly for negative numbers as well.

Note: This solution assumes that the input list contains only non-negative integers. If the input list can contain negative integers, the countOnes method should be updated to handle these cases correctly.
