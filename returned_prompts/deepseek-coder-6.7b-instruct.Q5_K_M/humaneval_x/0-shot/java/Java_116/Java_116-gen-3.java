Explanation:
Here we are sorting the given list of integers based on their binary representation. The Integer.bitCount(int i) returns the number of one-bits in the two's complement binary representation of the specified int value.

We use this to count the number of ones in the binary representation of the numbers in the list. If the count of ones is the same for two numbers, we compare them in decimal form. The sort is done in ascending order.

The function returns the sorted list.

This solution uses a custom comparator to sort the array. The Comparator first compares the number of ones in the binary representation of two numbers. If the counts are equal, it then compares the numbers in decimal form.

This solution uses Java's in-built Collections.sort() method which sorts the array according to the provided Comparator.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) because of the sorting operation. The space complexity is O(n) because we are storing the sorted array.

The solution assumes that the input list is not null or empty. If the input list can be null or empty, additional null or empty checks should be added.

The solution also assumes that the input list contains only non-negative integers. If the input list can contain negative integers, the solution should be modified to handle this case.
