I have to sort the array according to the number of ones in the binary representation of each number in ascending order. If the number of ones are same, then I have to sort them according to their decimal value. 
I have used Java's built-in method Integer.bitCount() to count the number of ones in the binary representation of each number. The result is then sorted according to this count and if the count is the same, then the decimal value of the numbers is compared.

A: Your code is correct, and it is a good solution. It sorts the array according to the number of ones in the binary representation of each number in ascending order. If the number of ones are same, then it sorts them according to their decimal value.

Here is a brief explanation of your code:

- A new `ArrayList` is created from the input list `arr`.
- The `Collections.sort()` method sorts the `ArrayList` in ascending order.
- A custom `Comparator` is passed to the `sort()` method to define the sorting order.
- In the `compare()` method, it first calculates the binary count of each number using `Integer.bitCount()`.
- If the binary counts are equal, it uses the `compareTo()` method to compare the decimal values of the two numbers.
- If the binary counts are not equal, it uses the `Integer.compare()` method to compare the binary counts.
- This custom `Comparator` sorts the `ArrayList` first by the number of ones in the binary representation, then by the decimal value if the counts are equal.
- The sorted `ArrayList`
