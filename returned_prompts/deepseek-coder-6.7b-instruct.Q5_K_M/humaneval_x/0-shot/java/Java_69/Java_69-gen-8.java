        Collections.sort(lst);
        int max = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < lst.size(); i++) {
            int count = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < lst.size(); j++) {
                if (lst.get(i).equals(lst.get(j))) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
            if (count >= lst.get(i)) {
                max = Math.max(max, lst.get(i));
            }
        }
        return max;
    }

}

The main idea of the algorithm is to first sort the list. Then, it loops through the list and counts the number of occurrences of each number. If the count is greater than or equal to the number itself, then the number is checked to see if it is greater than the current maximum. If it is, then it becomes the new maximum. Finally, the maximum is returned.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) because of the nested loops. This solution could be improved by using a HashMap to store the frequency of each number in the list, which would reduce the time complexity to O(n).

Also, the code could be simplified by using the for-each loop instead of the traditional for loop.

The code also does not handle the case where the list contains negative numbers. If it is possible to have negative numbers in the list, then the code needs to be modified to handle this case.

Overall, the code is correct and should work for most cases, but there are possible edge cases that it does not handle.
