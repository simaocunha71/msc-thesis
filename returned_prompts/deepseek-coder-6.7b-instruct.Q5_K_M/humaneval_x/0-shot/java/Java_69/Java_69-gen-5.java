        Collections.sort(lst, Collections.reverseOrder());
        for (int i = 0; i < lst.size(); i++) {
            if (lst.get(i) < i) {
                break;
            }
            if (Collections.frequency(lst, lst.get(i)) >= lst.get(i)) {
                return lst.get(i);
            }
        }
        return -1;

## 1.2.2. Explanation

The algorithm works by sorting the list in descending order. This allows the algorithm to quickly identify the largest numbers in the list. Afterwards, the algorithm iterates over the sorted list, comparing the frequency of each number to its own value. If the frequency of a number is greater than or equal to its value, the function returns the number.

This algorithm assumes that the input list will not contain negative numbers. If the list can contain negative numbers, the condition in the for loop should be modified to `if (i >= lst.get(i))` to correctly identify the largest positive number with a frequency greater than or equal to its value.

## 1.2.3. Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n log n) due to the sorting step. The space complexity is O(1) as it only uses a few variables and does not use any additional data structures.

# 1.3. Test Cases

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.search(Arrays.asList(4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1))); // 2
        System.out.println(sol.search(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4))); // 3
        System.out.println(sol.search(Arrays.asList(5, 5, 4, 4, 4))); // -1
    }
}
```

# 1.4. Conclusion

This solution is a straightforward approach
