        int max = -1;
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

        for (Integer num : lst) {
            map.put(num, map.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
        }

        for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry : map.entrySet()) {
            if (entry.getKey() <= entry.getValue()) {
                max = Math.max(max, entry.getKey());

This code works by using a HashMap to store the frequency of each integer in the list. It then iterates over the entries in the HashMap, and if the key (the integer) is less than or equal to the value (the frequency), it updates max with the key. Finally, it returns max, which will be the greatest integer with a frequency greater than or equal to the integer itself, or -1 if no such integer exists.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the input list, since it iterates over the list twice. The space complexity is also O(n), as it uses a HashMap to store the frequencies of the integers.

This solution assumes that the input list will only contain positive integers. If the input list can contain negative integers, the solution would need to be modified to handle that case.

This solution also assumes that the input list will not be null. If the input list can be null, the solution would need to be modified to handle that case.

This solution assumes that the input list will not be empty. If the input list can be empty, the solution would need to be modified to handle that case.

This solution assumes that the input list will not be very large. If the input list is very large, the solution may not be efficient.

This solution assumes that the input list will not contain non-integer values. If the input list can contain non-integer values, the solution would need to be modified to handle that case.

This solution assumes that the input list will not contain duplicate values. If the input list can contain duplicate values, the solution would need to be modified to handle that case.

This solution assumes that the input list will not contain values that are greater than the maximum value an integer can hold.
