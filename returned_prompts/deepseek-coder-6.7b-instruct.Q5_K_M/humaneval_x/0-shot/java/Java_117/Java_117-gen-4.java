This Java code takes a string s and a natural number n as input, and returns a list of all words from string s that contain exactly n consonants. It does this by splitting the string s into words and then checking each word to see if it contains exactly n consonants. If it does, it adds it to the result list.

In the loop, it checks each character in the word to see if it's a consonant by checking if it's not a vowel (i.e., not in the string "aeiouAEIOU"). If it's a consonant, it increments the consonants counter. If the consonants counter equals n, it adds the word to the result list.

Finally, it returns the result list.

The time complexity of this function is O(n*m), where n is the number of words in the string s and m is the length of the longest word. The space complexity is O(n), for storing the result list.
