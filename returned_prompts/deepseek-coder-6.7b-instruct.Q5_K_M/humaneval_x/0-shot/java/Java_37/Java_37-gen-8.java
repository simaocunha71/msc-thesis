A: It seems your question is incomplete. The question itself does not mention anything about the sorting in even indices.

This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that l' is identical to l in the odd indicies, while its values at the even indicies are equal to the values of the even indicies of l, but sorted.

So, if you have a list like [1,2,3,4,5,6], the even indices are [2,4,6], and after sorting these values, you get [2,4,6]. Now replace the values at the even indices of the original list with these sorted values. Hence, the output would be [1,2,2,4,5,6].

If you want to sort the even indices first and then replace the values at the even indices of the original list with the sorted values, you need to specify that in your question.

A: Here is the solution in Python, as you didn't specify any language.

def sortEven(l):
    evenIndices = [l[i] for i in range(0, len(l), 2)]
    evenIndices.sort()
    sortedEvenIndices = [evenIndices.pop(0) if i % 2 == 0 else l[i] for i in range(len(l))]
    return sortedEvenIndices

# Test cases
print(sortEven([1, 2, 3]))  # [1,
