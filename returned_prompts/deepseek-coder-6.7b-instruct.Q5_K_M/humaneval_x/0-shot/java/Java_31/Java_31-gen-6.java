Explanation:
This program checks whether a given number is prime. A number is prime if it has no divisors other than 1 and itself. For instance, the first six prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.

The function isPrime takes an integer n as input. The first few lines handle the edge cases where n is less than or equal to 1. If n is less than or equal to 1, it is not prime, so the function returns false.

After that, the function runs a loop from 2 to the square root of n. The loop checks if n is divisible by any number in this range. If n is divisible by any number in this range, it is not prime, so the function returns false.

If n is not divisible by any number in this range, it is prime, so the function returns true. The reason we only check up to the square root of n is that a larger factor of n would be a multiple of a smaller factor that has already been checked.

Note: This function uses the Math.sqrt() function to limit the range of numbers to check. This is an optimization to reduce the number of checks performed, which makes the function run faster on large inputs.

This solution is correct and efficient, but it does not handle the case where n is a negative number. If you want to handle this case, you can add an additional check at the beginning of the function to return false if n is less than 0.

A: This is a simple method to check if a given number is prime or not. It uses a for loop to iterate from 2 to the square root of the number. If the number is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime. If it is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime.

```java
public boolean isPrime(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) {
        return false;
    }
