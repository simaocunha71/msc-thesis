A: The code you've written is correct. It checks if a number is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of the number itself. If it is divisible, the number is not prime and the function returns false. If it doesn't find any number that divides the number, it means that the number is prime and the function returns true.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(sqrt(n)). This is because in the worst case scenario, it checks every number up to the square root of n to see if it divides n. 

The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space.

Here is the code with added comments explaining each step:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    /**
    Return true if a given number is prime, and false otherwise.
    >>> isPrime(6)
    false
    >>> isPrime(101)
    true
    >>> isPrime(11)
    true
    >>> isPrime(13441)
    false
    >>> isPrime(61)
    true
    >>> isPrime(4)
    false
    >>> isPrime(1)
    false
      */
    public boolean isPrime(int n) {
        // If the number is less than or equal to 1, it's not prime
        if(n <= 1){
            return false;
        }
        // Loop from 2 to the square root of the number
        for(int i = 2; i*i <= n; i++){
            // If the number is divisible by any number in this range, it's not prime
            if(n % i == 0){
                return false;
            }
        }
        // If we've gone through the whole loop and haven't returned, the number is prime
        return true;
