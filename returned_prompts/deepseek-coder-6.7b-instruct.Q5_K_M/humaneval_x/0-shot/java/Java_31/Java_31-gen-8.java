This code checks if a given number is prime or not by checking if it is divisible by any number less than or equal to its square root (which is an optimization over checking up to the number itself). If it is not divisible by any such number, then it is prime. If it is divisible by any such number, then it is not prime.

The code begins by checking if the number is less than or equal to 1. If it is, then it is not prime. If the number is 2, then it is prime. If the number is even (and not 2), then it is not prime.

Then, the code checks if the number is divisible by any odd number up to its square root. If it is, then it is not prime. If it is not divisible by any such number, then it is prime.

The reason for checking up to the square root of the number is that a larger factor of the number would be a multiple of a smaller factor that has already been checked.

The code uses a for loop to check each odd number up to the square root of the number. The loop starts at 3 and increments by 2 each time (since even numbers greater than 2 cannot be prime) to check if the number is divisible by any of these numbers. If it is, then it is not prime, and the function returns false. If it is not divisible by any of these numbers, then it is prime, and the function returns true.
