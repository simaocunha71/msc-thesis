            } else if (!stack.isEmpty() && stack.peek() == '<' && c == '>') {
                stack.pop();
            } else {
                return false;

A: Here is a simple and effective solution. 

Here we are using a stack of characters to solve the problem. We iterate over the string and for each character, if it is an open bracket ("<"), we push it on the stack. If it is a close bracket (">"), we check if the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is an open bracket ("<"), then we pop the top of the stack. If this is not the case, we return false. Finally, if the stack is empty, we return true, otherwise we return false.

In the given problem, we are checking if every opening bracket "<" has a corresponding closing bracket ">". Therefore, if at any point there is a closing bracket ">" without a corresponding opening bracket "<" on the stack, we return false. If we finish iterating over the string without finding any unmatched closing brackets, we return true.

This solution is effective as it uses a stack, which has a time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(n) in the worst case scenario.

Here is the Java code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    public boolean correctBracketing(String brackets) {
        Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<Character>();
        for (char c : brackets.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == '<') {
                stack.push(c);
            } else if (!stack.isEmpty() && stack.peek() == '<' && c == '>') {
                stack.pop();
            } else {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return stack.isEmpty();
    }
}
```

This solution works as expected and
