                stack.pop();
            } else {

This program uses a stack to solve the problem. It iterates through each character in the string. If it encounters a '<', it pushes it onto the stack. If it encounters a '>', it pops the top of the stack. If the stack is empty and it encounters a '>', the function returns false. Finally, it returns whether the stack is empty or not. If it's not empty, that means there's an unmatched '<', so the function returns false.

This program runs in O(n) time, where n is the length of the string. It uses O(n) extra space for the stack.

This program would be correct for any string of "<" and ">" where every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

The provided test cases cover a variety of cases:
1. One opening bracket, no closing brackets.
2. Two opening brackets, two closing brackets.
3. Opening brackets followed by closing brackets.
4. Closing brackets followed by opening brackets.
5. No brackets.
6. Unbalanced brackets.
7. Mixed brackets.
8. Nested brackets.
9. Brackets with text in between.
10. Multiple pairs of brackets.

The program should pass these test cases.
