The problem is to calculate the total number of carrots that the rabbit ate after his meals and the number of carrots left after his meals.

The rabbit can eat a certain number of carrots if there are enough remaining carrots. If there are not enough remaining carrots, the rabbit will eat all remaining carrots and will be hungry afterwards.

The function eat() takes three parameters: the number of carrots that the rabbit has eaten, the number of carrots that the rabbit needs to eat, and the number of remaining carrots. It returns a list of two integers: the total number of carrots that the rabbit ate after his meals and the number of carrots left after his meals.

If the rabbit needs to eat more carrots than there are remaining, the rabbit eats all the remaining carrots and there are no carrots left.

This problem is solved using a simple if-else statement to check if there are enough remaining carrots for the rabbit to eat. If there are, the rabbit eats the required number of carrots and subtracts it from the remaining carrots. If there are not enough remaining carrots, the rabbit eats all the remaining carrots and there are no carrots left.

The solution is efficient and easy to understand.
