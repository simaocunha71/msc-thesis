        return l.stream().map(i -> i + 1).collect(Collectors.toList());
    }
}


A: The answer you provided seems to be correct. It uses Java 8 stream API to increment each element by 1 in the list. It maps each element of the stream to the result of i + 1 (which increments the element by 1), then collects the results back into a list.
It will work as expected with any list of integers.

A: Your solution is correct and it will work perfectly. However, if you want to solve this problem using a traditional approach without using Java 8 Stream API, you can use a for-each loop as follows:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<Integer> incrList(List<Integer> l) {
        for (int i = 0; i < l.size(); i++) {
            l.set(i, l.get(i) + 1);
        }
        return l;
    }
}
```
This code will also give you the expected output.
