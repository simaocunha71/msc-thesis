        return l.stream().map(i -> ++i).collect(Collectors.toList());
    }
}


A: The problem in your code is that you are not decrementing the value of i, you are incrementing it before it is added to the list.
Here is the corrected code:
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

class Solution {
    /**
    Return list with elements incremented by 1.
    >>> incrList(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3))
     [2, 3, 4]
    >>> incrList(Arrays.asList(5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123))
     [6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]
    */
    public List<Integer> incrList(List<Integer> l) {
        return l.stream().map(i -> i + 1).collect(Collectors.toList());
    }
}

In the corrected code, I used `i -> i + 1` instead of `i -> ++i`. This means that for each element in the list, we add 1 to it and return the new value. This is equivalent to incrementing each element by 1.

This code works by using the Java Stream API to create a new list where each element is incremented by 1. The `map` function is used to apply a function to each element in the list, and `collect` is used to collect the results into a new list.

Here is the output for your test cases:

>>> incrList(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3))
[2, 3, 4]
>>> incrList(Arrays.asList(5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123))
[6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]

Please note that this code will not modify
