        return l.stream().map(x -> x + 1).collect(Collectors.toList());
    }
}


A: The provided solution is correct. It uses Java 8 streams to increment each element in the given list by 1. Here is how it works:


*

*stream() - converts the list into a Stream.

*map(x -> x + 1) - applies the function (x -> x + 1) to each element in the stream. This function increments each element by 1.

*collect(Collectors.toList()) - collects the results into a new list.


So, if you run it with your examples, it will give you the expected results.

A: You can also use a traditional for-each loop to solve this problem:

```java
public List<Integer> incrList(List<Integer> l) {
    for(int i = 0; i < l.size(); i++) {
        l.set(i, l.get(i) + 1);
    }
    return l;
}
```
This code will iterate over the list, and for each element, it increments it by 1. It then returns the modified list.

A: This is a simple way to solve the problem using a for-each loop:
public List<Integer> incrList(List<Integer> l) {
    for(int i = 0; i < l.size(); i++){
        l.set(i, l.get(i) + 1);
    }
    return l;
}

In this code, the for-
