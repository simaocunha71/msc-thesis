This Java program creates a new list which contains the rescaled version of the input list. The rescaling operation is done by subtracting the minimum value of the list from each number, then dividing by the range of the list. The rescaled list is then returned.

Here, `Collections.min(numbers)` and `Collections.max(numbers)` are used to find the minimum and maximum values in the list, respectively. The range of the list is calculated by subtracting the minimum from the maximum.

Finally, a for-each loop is used to iterate over each number in the list, subtract the minimum, and divide by the range, adding the result to the new list. The new list is then returned.

The `main` method is used to test the `rescaleToUnit` method with a list of numbers.

The output of this program will be:
`[0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]` which is the rescaled version of the input list.

The time complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the length of the list. This is because we are iterating over the list once. The space complexity is also O(n), because we are creating a new list to store the rescaled values.

The `rescaleToUnit` method assumes that the input list is non-empty and contains at least two numbers. If the input list is empty or contains only one number, the method will not work correctly.
