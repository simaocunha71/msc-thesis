        List<Double> result = new ArrayList<Double>();
        double min = Collections.min(numbers);
        double max = Collections.max(numbers);
        for(double d : numbers){
            result.add((d-min)/(max-min));

This code will take a list of double numbers and rescale each of them to a value from 0 to 1. This is done by subtracting the minimum value from each number and then dividing by the difference between the max and min values. This will rescale the numbers so that the minimum value becomes 0 and the maximum value becomes 1.
