        List<Double> rescaled = new ArrayList<Double>();
        double min = Collections.min(numbers);
        double max = Collections.max(numbers);
        for(double num : numbers){
            rescaled.add((num-min)/(max-min));
        }
        return rescaled;
    }
}


A: You are on the right track. 
Here is the corrected version of your code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    /**
    Given list of numbers  (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
    such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1
    >>> rescaleToUnit(Arrays.asList(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0))
    [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
     */
    public List<Double> rescaleToUnit(List<Double> numbers) {
        List<Double> rescaled = new ArrayList<Double>();
        double min = Collections.min(numbers);
        double max = Collections.max(numbers);
        for(double num : numbers){
            rescaled.add((num-min)/(max-min));
        }
        return rescaled;
    }
}
```

This code will rescale the numbers so that the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1. The formula used for rescaling is `(x - min) / (max - min)` where x is each number in the list, min is the smallest number in the list, and max is the largest number in the list.

It takes a list of doubles as input, calculates the min and max values, and then iterates over the list, applying the rescaling formula to each number. The rescaled values are added to a new list which is then returned.

This code should work as expected.

Please note: The input list should have at least two elements. If there is a chance that the input list might not have at least two elements,
