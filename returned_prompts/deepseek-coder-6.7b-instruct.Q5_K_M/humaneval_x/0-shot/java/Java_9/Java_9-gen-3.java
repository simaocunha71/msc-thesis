        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

        for (int number : numbers) {
            max = Math.max(max, number);
            result.add(max);
        }

        return result;
    }
}


A: The question is asking to generate a list of maximum numbers found until the given moment in the sequence. So, we need to keep track of the maximum number so far and add it to the resulting list.

Here is the Python code:

```python
def rollingMax(numbers):
    result = []
    max_so_far = float('-inf')

    for number in numbers:
        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, number)
        result.append(max_so_far)

    return result
```

In this code, we start with a list of numbers and an empty list for the result. We also set `max_so_far` to negative infinity. Then we iterate through the numbers in the list. For each number, we update `max_so_far` to be the maximum of the current number and `max_so_far`. Then we append `max_so_far` to the result list. Finally, we return the result list.

So if the input is [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2], the output will be [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4].


This is a simple solution and it works in O(n) time, where n is the length of the input list. It uses O(n) space to store the result.

Hope this helps.
