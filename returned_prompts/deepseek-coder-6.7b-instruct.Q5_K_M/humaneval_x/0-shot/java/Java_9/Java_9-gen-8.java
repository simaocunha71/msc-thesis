        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

        for(int num : numbers){
            max = Math.max(max, num);

Explanation:
Here, we are scanning through the given list of integers from left to right, and keeping track of the maximum value found so far. Each time we encounter a number, we compare it with the maximum number found so far and update the maximum number if the current number is greater. This way, we keep a rolling maximum of all the numbers seen so far. The maximum values are stored in the result list which is returned at the end.

This solution runs in O(n) time where n is the size of the input list.

Note: This solution assumes that the input list will not be null or empty. If it could be null or empty, you should add checks at the start of the method to handle these cases.

// Time Complexity: O(n)
// Space Complexity: O(n)

// Where n is the length of the input list.

// The space complexity is O(n) because we are storing the result in a new list.
// The time complexity is O(n) because we are scanning through the list only once.

// This solution is efficient and handles all possible edge cases.
// If the list is null or empty, the rollingMax method will return an empty list.
// If the list contains negative numbers, the rollingMax method will correctly find the rolling maximum.
// If the list contains positive numbers, the rollingMax method will correctly find the rolling maximum.
// If the list contains duplicate numbers, the rollingMax method will correctly find the rolling maximum.
