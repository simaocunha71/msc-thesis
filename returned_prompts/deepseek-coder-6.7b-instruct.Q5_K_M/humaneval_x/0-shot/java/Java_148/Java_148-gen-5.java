A: The function you wrote is correct. It returns all the planets whose orbits are between the orbits of the two given planets, sorted by their proximity to the sun.

A: A better solution would be to use an ordered set of planets, such as a TreeSet, where the natural ordering is the order of their proximity to the sun. This allows you to easily find the index of a planet and easily find all planets in between two given planets.

Here is how you could modify your function to use a TreeSet:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public List<String> bf(String planet1, String planet2) {
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();

        // Set of planets in order of their proximity to the sun
        TreeSet<String> planets = new TreeSet<>(Arrays.asList(
            "Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus
