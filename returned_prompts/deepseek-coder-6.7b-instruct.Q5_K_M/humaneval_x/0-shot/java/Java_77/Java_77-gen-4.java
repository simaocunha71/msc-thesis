Explanation:

This solution uses a modified version of the binary search algorithm to find the cube root of the absolute value of the input integer. This is because the cube root of a number is the value that, when cubed, gives the original number. The binary search is used because it is a more efficient search algorithm than linear search. The binary search is particularly useful in this case because it allows us to quickly narrow down the possible range of cube roots.

The algorithm starts by setting two pointers, start and end, to 0 and the absolute value of the input integer, respectively. It then enters a while loop that continues until start is greater than end. In each iteration of the loop, the algorithm calculates the cube of the midpoint of the current range, and compares this cube to the absolute value of the input integer. If they are equal, the function returns true, indicating that the input integer is a cube of some integer. If the cube is less than the input integer, the start pointer is moved to mid + 1, effectively narrowing down the search range to the upper half of the current range. If the cube is greater than the input integer, the end pointer is moved to mid - 1, narrowing down the search range to the lower half of the current range. If the function finishes the while loop without finding a cube root, it returns false, indicating that the input integer is not a cube of any integer.

This solution works because the cube of an integer x is equal to x * x * x. Therefore, if a number a is a cube of some integer x, its absolute value will be equal to x * x * x. The algorithm uses this fact to check if the input integer is a cube of some integer.
