The answer provided by the user is correct. However, the user did not provide the explanation of the solution. 

Explanation:
This solution uses the binary search method to find if the given number (a) is a cube of some integer number. 

The binary search is used to find the cube root of a number. The range of the binary search is from 0 to the number itself (as cube root of any number will lie in this range). 

In each iteration of the binary search, the mid value is calculated and its cube is checked if it matches with the given number. If it matches, then the function returns true as the number is a cube of some integer. 

If the cubed value is less than the given number, then the lower limit is set as mid+1. If the cubed value is greater than the given number, then the higher limit is set as mid-1. This process continues until the lower limit is less than or equal to the higher limit. 

If the function does not find any match in the given range, then it returns false as the number is not a cube of any integer.

The use of long data type for mid and cubed is to avoid overflow for large inputs. The use of unsigned right shift (>>>) operator is to avoid overflow for negative inputs.

Overall, this solution is a efficient way to check if a given number is a cube of some integer.


Time complexity: O(log N)
Space complexity: O(1)


Note: The binary search approach is used as it reduces the time complexity of the solution from O(N) to O(log N).


In conclusion, the user's solution is correct and provides an efficient approach to solve
