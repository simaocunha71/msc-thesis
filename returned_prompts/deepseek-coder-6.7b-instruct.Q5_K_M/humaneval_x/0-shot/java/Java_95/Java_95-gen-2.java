        if(dict.isEmpty())
            return false;

B:
        int upper = 0;
        int lower = 0;

C:
        for(Object key: dict.keySet()){
            if(key instanceof String){
                if(((String)key).equals(((String)key).toUpperCase()))
                    upper++;
                else if(((String)key).equals(((String)key).toLowerCase()))
                    lower++;
            }
        }

D:
        if(upper > 0 && lower > 0)
            return false;

E:
        return true;

    }
}

In the code above, you can see the implementation of the function `checkDictCase`.

- At A, the function checks if the dictionary is empty, if it is, it immediately returns `false`.
- At B, two variables `upper` and `lower` are initialized to count the number of keys in the dictionary that are in uppercase and lowercase respectively.
- At C, the function iterates through the keys in the dictionary. If the key is a string, it checks if it is in uppercase or lowercase by comparing the key to its uppercase and lowercase versions respectively.
- At D, if both upper and lower counts are greater than 0, the function immediately returns `false`. This indicates that there are keys in both uppercase and lowercase.
- At E, if the function has not returned `false` at any point, it means that all keys in the dictionary are either all in uppercase or all in lowercase. The function then returns `true`.

This function uses the `Map.keySet()` method to get the set of keys in the dictionary. The `instanceof` operator is used to check if the key is a string. The `toUpperCase()` and `toLowerCase()` methods are used to convert a string to uppercase and lowercase respectively.

Please note that this function assumes that all non-string keys in the dictionary are not in uppercase or lowercase. If this is not the case, the function may not work as expected.
