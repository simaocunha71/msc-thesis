The function works by first checking if the map is empty. If it is, it returns false because it wouldn't make sense to continue checking the keys.

It then iterates over each key in the map and checks if it is a string. If not, it returns false.

After that, it iterates over each character in the string. If it finds a lower case character, it sets allUpperCase to false. If it finds an upper case character, it sets allLowerCase to false.

If it ever encounters a key where all the characters are either upper case or lower case, it returns false.

Finally, if it makes it through all the keys without ever encountering a key where all the characters are either upper case or lower case, it returns true.

This is assuming that by "all keys are strings in lower case or all keys are strings in upper case" you mean that the entire key must be in lower case or upper case, not just the first character. If you meant that only the first character needs to be in lower case or upper case, you would need to adjust the function accordingly.

Also, this function assumes that the map is a java.util.Map, not a subclass or a custom class. If you're using a subclass or a custom class, you would need to adjust the function accordingly.
