The solution uses a two-pointer approach. First, it sorts the list, then it iterates over the list from the start to the third last element. For each element, it uses a two-pointer approach to find two other elements in the remainder of the list that sum to the negation of the current element. If it finds such pairs, it returns true. If it doesn't find any such pairs, it returns false.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the size of the list. This is because it performs a single pass over the list to sort it, and then performs a single pass over each possible starting element of a triplet.

The space complexity is O(1), because it only uses a constant amount of additional space.

Note: The solution assumes that the input list contains no null elements and that no element appears more than once in the list.

The solution uses the Java programming language.

The solution is a complete Java program that can be compiled and run from the command line. It can also be run in any Java development environment that supports Java 8 or later.

The solution includes a main method for testing, but this method is not part of the solution itself.

The solution includes comments explaining the logic and the algorithm used.

The solution includes a JavaDoc comment at the top of the file, explaining what the program does and how to use it.

The solution includes a JavaDoc comment before each method, explaining what the method does and how it should be used.
