        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>(l);

        // iterate through each pair of elements
        for (int i = 0; i < l.size() - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < l.size(); j++) {
                // check if their sum is in the set of distinct elements
                if (set.contains(-(l.get(i) + l.get(j)))) {
                    return true;

The solution works by first checking if the list has at least 3 elements. If it does not, it returns False immediately.

Then, it creates a set from the list to improve the performance of the contains operation.

The solution then iterates through each pair of elements in the list, and checks if their sum is in the set of distinct elements. If it is, the function returns True. If no such pair is found after checking all pairs, the function returns False.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) where n is the size of the list, because it iterates through each pair of elements in the list. The space complexity is O(n) because it uses a set to store the distinct elements in the list.

The solution assumes that the input list does not contain any null values. If the list can contain null values, the solution must be modified to handle these cases.

Note: This solution assumes that the input list does not contain any null values. If the list can contain null values, the solution must be modified to handle these cases.
