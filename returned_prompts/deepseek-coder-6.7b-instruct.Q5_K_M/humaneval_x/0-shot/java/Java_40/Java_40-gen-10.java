A: The problem is that you are not handling the case when the list size is less than 3. The inner loops start from i+1, j+1 which means it will fail for lists of size 1 and 2. 
So the modified code will be:

```java
public boolean triplesSumToZero(List<Integer> l) {
    if (l.size() < 3) {
        return false;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < l.size() - 2; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < l.size() - 1; j++) {
            for (int k = j + 1; k < l.size(); k++) {
                if (l.get(i) + l.get(j) + l.get(k) == 0) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

This code will return false for lists of size less than 3 and for the cases where there are not three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero. 

It will return true if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, otherwise it returns false.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^3) where n is the size of the list. It's because we are using three nested loops to iterate over the list.

This is not the most efficient solution, but it works fine for small lists. If you need a solution that works for larger lists, you might need to look into more efficient algorithms or data structures.

Please note that this solution doesn't consider the case where the input list may contain duplicate numbers. If you want to
