Explanation:
This solution uses a two-pointer approach to solve this problem. The idea is to sort the array and then for each element `a[i]` in the array, find two other elements `a[j]` and `a[k]` such that `a[i] + a[j] + a[k] == 0`. If such elements are found, return true. If no such elements are found, return false.

The two pointers approach is used to find `a[j]` and `a[k]`. Initially, `j` is set to `i+1` and `k` is set to `size-1`. If the sum of `a[i]`, `a[j]` and `a[k]` is less than 0, then `j` is incremented. If the sum is greater than 0, then `k` is decremented. If the sum is equal to 0, then we have found a triplet that sums to 0 and we return true.

The reason we need to handle the case where `a[i] == a[i-1]` is because we want to skip duplicate elements to avoid finding the same triplet multiple times. This is because the same triplet will always sum to 0.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) where n is
