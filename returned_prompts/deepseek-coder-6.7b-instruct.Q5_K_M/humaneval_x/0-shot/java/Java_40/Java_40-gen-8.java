A: Here is the solution for your problem:

```java
public boolean triplesSumToZero(List<Integer> l) {
    if(l.size()<3) return false; // If list size less than 3 then no possibility to form triplets.

    Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>(l); // Use a set to check for duplicate elements.
    for(int i=0;i<l.size()-2;i++) {
        for(int j=i+1;j<l.size()-1;j++) {
            for(int k=j+1;k<l.size();k++) {
                if(set.contains(-(l.get(i)+l.get(j)+l.get(k)))) { // If sum of triplets is present in set then return true.
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return false; // If no triplets found then return false.
}
```

This solution works by iterating through the list and checking for all possible triplets. For each triplet, it calculates the sum and checks if it is present in the set. If it is, it returns true. If no triplet is found, it returns false.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^3) because we are iterating through the list three times. This solution assumes that the list doesn't contain duplicate elements. If the list can contain duplicate elements, then we need to remove them from the set and adjust the code accordingly.

Please note that this solution assumes that the list doesn't contain duplicate elements. If the list can contain duplicate elements, then we need to remove them from the set and adjust the code accordingly.

Also note that this solution doesn't handle the case where the list contains negative numbers. If the list can contain negative numbers, then we need to adjust the code accordingly.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if you need any further clarification.

A: Here is a solution using the HashSet. This solution is based on the fact that for any three numbers a, b and c, if the sum of these numbers is zero then a + b
