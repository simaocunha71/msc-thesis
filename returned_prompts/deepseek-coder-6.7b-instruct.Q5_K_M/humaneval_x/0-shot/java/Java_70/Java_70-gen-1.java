            result.add(sortedList.remove(0)); // remove the first element

                result.add(sortedList.remove(sortedList.size() - 1)); // remove the last element

This solution sorts the original list, then removes the minimum and maximum from the sorted list and adds them to the result list. It continues until the sorted list is empty.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) because of the sorting operation, and the space complexity is O(n) for the sorted list and the result list.

Also, note that this solution assumes that the input list is not null. If the input list can be null, you should add a null check at the beginning of the method.

Also, note that this solution assumes that the input list contains distinct elements. If the input list can contain duplicate elements, you should add a check to remove only the first occurrence of the maximum element when adding it to the result list.

Also, note that this solution assumes that the input list contains at least one element. If the input list can be empty, you should add a check at the beginning of the method to return an empty list immediately.

Also, note that this solution assumes that the input list contains positive integers. If the input list can contain negative integers, you should add a check to handle them correctly.

Also, note that this solution assumes that the input list contains integers. If the input list can contain other types of elements, you should add a check to handle them correctly.
