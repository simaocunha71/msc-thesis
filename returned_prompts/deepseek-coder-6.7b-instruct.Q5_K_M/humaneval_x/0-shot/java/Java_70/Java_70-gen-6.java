        //sort the arraylist in ascending order
        Collections.sort(lst);

        //create a new list to store the result
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();

        //initialize two pointers, one at the beginning and the other at the end
        int begin = 0, end = lst.size() - 1;

        //while there are elements in the list
        while (begin <= end) {
            //add the smallest element to the result
            result.add(lst.get(begin));

            //if there are more elements, add the largest one as well
            if (begin < end) {
                result.add(lst.get(end));
            }

            //move the pointers
            begin++;
            end--;
        }
        return result;
    }
}

The time complexity of the given solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, and the space complexity is O(n) since we create a new list to store the result.

This solution works by sorting the input list and then alternating between adding the smallest and largest remaining elements to the output list until all elements have been processed. This results in the elements being sorted in a strange order, as required.

The solution also handles the case where the input list is empty, returning an empty list as the result.

This is a fairly straightforward approach, but it does require some understanding of the problem and how to implement it in code.

In the future, it would be helpful to provide a more detailed explanation of the solution, explaining the reasoning behind the approach and the steps involved.

Please note that the code provided is a solution in Java. If you require a solution in a different programming language, please specify the language in the question.
