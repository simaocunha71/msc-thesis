        String result = "";

B:
        for(int i = 0; i < text.length(); i++){
            char ch = text.charAt(i);
            if(ch != 'a' && ch != 'e' && ch != 'i' && ch != 'o' && ch != 'u' && ch != 'A' && ch != 'E' && ch != 'I' && ch != 'O' && ch != 'U'){
                result += ch;
            }
        }

C:
        return result;
    }
}


A: This is a simple loop that checks each character of the string, if it is not a vowel, it adds it to the result string.

A: This is the initialization of the result variable which will hold the final string.

B: This is the main loop that goes through each character of the input string.

C: This is the return of the result string which will be the original string without any vowels.


The code is correct and should work as expected, removing the vowels from the input string.


A: Here is the flow of the program:

1. Initialize an empty string "result".
2. Start a for loop to iterate through each character in the input string.
3. In the loop, check if the current character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u in both lower and upper case). If it is not a vowel, add it to the "result" string.
4. After all characters have been checked, return the "result" string. This string will be the input string but without any vowels.

So the program works by checking each character of the input string and adding it to the "result" string if it is not a vowel. At the end, it returns the "result" string which is the input string without any vowels.



This is a simple solution to the problem. It does not handle any special characters or numbers in the input string. If you want to handle those cases, you would need to add additional checks to the loop.
