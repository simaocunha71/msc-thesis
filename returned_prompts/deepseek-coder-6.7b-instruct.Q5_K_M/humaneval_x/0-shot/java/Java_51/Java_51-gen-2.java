        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String vowels = "aeiouAEIOU";
        for (int i = 0; i < text.length(); i++) {
            if (vowels.indexOf(text.charAt(i)) == -1) {
                sb.append(text.charAt(i));
            }
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}

This code will go through each character in the string and check if it is a vowel by using the indexOf function in the string "aeiouAEIOU" which contains all vowels. If the indexOf function returns -1, that means the character is not a vowel and it is appended to the StringBuilder. Finally, the string is returned.
This solution will also work with characters that are not lowercase or uppercase vowels, but it's not tested with other characters.
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string.
