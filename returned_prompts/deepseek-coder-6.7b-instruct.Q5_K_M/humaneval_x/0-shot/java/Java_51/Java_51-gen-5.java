        String result = "";

B:
        for (int i = 0; i < text.length(); i++) {
            char c = text.charAt(i);
            if (c != 'a' && c != 'e' && c != 'i' && c != 'o' && c != 'u' && c != 'A' && c != 'E' && c != 'I' && c != 'O' && c != 'U') {
                result += c;
            }

C:
        return result;
    }
}

In this code, we initialize an empty string result. Then we loop through the input string text, and for each character, we add it to result if it is not a vowel. Finally, we return result, which is the input string without any vowels.
The time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the length of the input string text. This is because we have a single loop that runs n times.
The space complexity is also O(n), which is the space used by the result string. In the worst case, the result string will be the same length as the input string if no characters are removed.

// If you want to consider all whitespace characters (including '\n', '\t', '\r', etc.) as vowels, you can add them to the if condition.
