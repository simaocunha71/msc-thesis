## Answer:

```
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution  {
    public String solve(int N)  {
        String binary = Integer.toBinaryString(N);
        int sum = 0;
        for (char c : binary.toCharArray()) {
            sum += Character.getNumericValue(c);
        }
        return Integer.toBinaryString(sum);
    }
}
```

## Explanation:

In the code, firstly, we convert the input integer to its binary representation using the `Integer.toBinaryString(N)` method.

Then we initialize a variable `sum` to keep track of the total sum of digits in binary. For each character in the binary string, we convert it back to an integer using `Character.getNumericValue(c)` and add it to `sum`.

Finally, we return the binary representation of `sum` using the `Integer.toBinaryString(sum)` method. This gives us the binary representation of the sum of the digits of the input integer.

For example, if the input is 147, its binary representation is 1001001. The sum of these digits is 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 3, so the output will be the binary representation of 3, which is 11. Thus, the method `solve(147)` will return "11".

This solution has a time complexity of O(log N) because we convert the integer to binary, which takes O(log N) operations. The space complexity is also O(log N) because we store the binary representation of the integer.

Note: This solution assumes that the input is a positive integer. If the input could be negative, you would need to add additional code to handle that case.
