        int sum = 0;

        while (N > 0) {
            sum += N % 10;
            N /= 10;
        }

        return Integer.toBinaryString(sum);
    }

}

This code takes an integer as input and returns its sum of digits in binary. It does this by first calculating the sum of the digits in the input number, then converting that sum into a binary string.

The while loop in the code takes each digit of the input number and adds it to the sum. The input number is divided by 10 in each iteration to remove the last digit.

The Integer.toBinaryString() method is used to convert the sum into a binary string.

This code works by iterating through each digit of the input number and summing them. The sum is then converted to a binary string and returned.

This solution has a time complexity of O(log(N)) and a space complexity of O(1), where N is the input number.
