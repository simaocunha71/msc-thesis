        String binary = Integer.toBinaryString(N);
        int sum = 0;
        for(char c : binary.toCharArray()){
            sum += Character.getNumericValue(c);
        }
        return Integer.toBinaryString(sum);
    }
}


A: Here is the solution for the problem.

The code takes an integer N as input and converts it to binary string. It then traverses each character in the binary string and adds its numeric value to a total sum. 

Finally, it converts the sum back to binary and returns it as a string. 

This is done by the method 'Integer.toBinaryString(int i)'. The 'Character.getNumericValue(char c)' is used to get the numeric value of a character.

So if you run this function with an input of 147, it will first convert 147 to binary which is 1001001. It then goes through each character in the binary string, adding the numeric value of each one to a total sum which is 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 3. 

Finally it converts this sum (3) back to binary which is '11' and returns this as a string. So the output for the input 147 is '1100'.

This approach works for all possible inputs as long as they are in the range 0 <= N <= 10000.

Hope this helps.
