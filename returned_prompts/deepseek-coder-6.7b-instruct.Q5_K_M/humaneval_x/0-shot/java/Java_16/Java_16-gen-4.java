A: You are correct. Your solution is correct and the complexity of your solution is O(n), n being the length of the string. This is because you are iterating over the string once to add the characters to the set and then once to return the size of the set, which takes constant time.

Your code is simple, clean, and efficient. You used the HashSet class in Java, which is a collection of objects that does not allow duplicate elements. It models the mathematical set abstraction and provides a high-performance implementation. Your solution works by iterating over the string, converting each character to lowercase, and then adding it to the set. If the set already contains the character, it will not add it again, effectively counting the distinct characters.

Overall, your solution is correct and efficient. It's a good example of how to use the HashSet class in Java to solve a problem.

If you want to count only alphabetic characters, you can add a condition to check if the character is a letter before adding it to the set. Here is the modified code:

```java
public int countDistinctCharacters(String string) {
    Set<Character> distinctChars = new HashSet<Character>();
    for (int i = 0; i < string.length(); i++) {
        char c = Character.toLowerCase(string.charAt(i));
        if (Character.isLetter(c)) {
            distinctChars.add(c);
        }
    }
    return distinctChars.size();
}
```

In this modified version, the `Character.isLetter(c)` method is used to check if the character is a letter before adding it to the set. If it is not a letter, it will not be added to the set, effectively ignoring non-alphabetic characters.
