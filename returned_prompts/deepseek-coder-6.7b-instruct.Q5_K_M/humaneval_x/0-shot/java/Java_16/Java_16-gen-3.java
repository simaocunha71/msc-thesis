        Set<Character> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < string.length(); i++) {
            set.add(Character.toLowerCase(string.charAt(i)));
        }
        return set.size();
    }
}


A: The solution provided is correct and efficient. However, the question mentions that it should consider uppercase and lowercase versions of the same letter as the same character (regardless of case). 

The provided solution does not meet this requirement. The HashSet uses case-sensitive comparison, so 'a' and 'A' are considered distinct characters. If you want to count them as the same character, you need to convert the string to lower case before adding characters to the set.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int countDistinctCharacters(String string) {
        Set<Character> set = new HashSet<>();
        string = string.toLowerCase(); // convert string to lowercase
        for (int i = 0; i < string.length(); i++) {
            set.add(string.charAt(i));
        }
        return set.size();
    }
}
```

This code will now correctly count the number of distinct characters in the string, regardless of whether they are uppercase or lowercase.


A: Your question is a bit unclear. If you are asking for the count of distinct characters in a string irrespective of their case, then the solution provided is correct. 

However, if you want to count each character only once irrespective of their case, you can do so by converting the entire string to lowercase before adding it to the set. 

Here's how you can modify your function:

```java
public int countDistinctCharacters(String string) {
    Set<Character> set = new HashSet<>();
    string = string.toLowerCase();
    for (int i = 0; i < string.length(); i++) {
        set.add(string.charAt(i));
    }
    return set.size();
}
```

This will count the number of distinct characters in a string irrespective of their case.
