        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for(int i = 0; i < string.length(); i++) {
            result.add(string.substring(0, i + 1));
        }
        return result;
    }
}

The solution provided by the user is correct. The loop goes through the string from the start to the end, creating a new substring of the string from the start to the current position. Each substring is then added to the result list. So, the result list will contain all prefixes of the input string from shortest to longest.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) because of the substring operation, where n is the length of the string. The space complexity is O(n) as we are storing all prefixes in a list.

This solution handles the problem as described, and the code is correct and efficient.

The test case provided in the question is also correct and will pass this solution. For example, calling allPrefixes("abc") will return a list with elements ["a", "ab", "abc"].

Please let me know if you have any questions or if there is anything else I can help you with.

I hope this explanation is clear and helpful. Thank you for your time and attention to this question.
