        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < string.length(); i++) {

The method allPrefixes adds to the list all prefixes of the input string by using a for loop which iterates from 0 to the length of the string and adds the substring from the start of the string to the i-th character to the list.

The substring method is used to get a part of the string from the start to the i-th character. The index of the character is i + 1 because string indices are 0-based in Java.

The method returns the list of all prefixes of the string. The prefixes are in the order from the shortest to the longest.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) because of the substring method inside the loop. The space complexity is O(n) because of the list that stores all the prefixes.

//Test Cases:
//Input: "abc"
//Output: ["a", "ab", "abc"]

//Input: "code"
//Output: ["c", "co", "cod", "code"]

//Input: "abcd"
//Output: ["a", "ab", "abc", "abcd"]

//Input: "xyz"
//Output: ["x", "xy", "xyz"]

//Input: "java"
//Output: ["j", "ja", "jav", "java"]

//Input: "t"
//Output: ["t"]
//Input: ""
//Output: []

//Note: The substring method in Java is O(n), where n is the length of the string. So, the overall time complexity of this solution is O(n^2). The space complexity is O(n) because we are storing all the prefixes in a list.

//This solution handles edge cases such as input string being empty or having only one character. It will return an empty list in case of an empty string and a list with the single element in case of a string with only one character.

/*
This solution is correct because it returns all prefixes of the
