This code checks each number in the given list to see if it contains any even digit. If a number doesn't contain even digit, it is added to the output list. Finally, the output list is sorted and returned.


The complexity of this solution is O(n*m*log(n*m)) where n is the number of elements in the list and m is the average number of digits in each number. The sorting operation is O(n*log(n)).


Explanation:
- The for loop iterates over each number in the given list x.
- The hasNoEvenDigit function checks if each number has an even digit.
- If a number has an even digit, it returns false. If it doesn't have an even digit, it returns true.
- The if statement inside the for loop checks if the hasNoEvenDigit function returned true. If it did, the number is added to the output list.
- Finally, the output list is sorted in increasing order and returned.


This code assumes that the input list x only contains positive integers. If negative numbers or zero are possible in the input list, additional error checking would be needed.


In the first example, the numbers 15, 33, and 1 have no even digits, so they are added to the output list. The list is sorted in increasing order, so the result is [1, 15, 33].

In the second example, all numbers in the input list have an even digit, so the output list is empty.
