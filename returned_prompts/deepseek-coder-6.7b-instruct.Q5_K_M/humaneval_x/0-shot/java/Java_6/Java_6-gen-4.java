A: The task seems to be quite straightforward and can be solved with a simple stack-based approach.

Here is a python solution for the problem:

```python
def parseNestedParens(s):
    groups = s.split()
    results = []
    for group in groups:
        stack = []
        max_depth = 0
        for char in group:
            if char == '(':
                stack.append(char)
                if len(stack) > max_depth:
                    max_depth = len(stack)
            elif char == ')':
                stack.pop()
        results.append(max_depth)
    return results
```

In the code above, we split the input string into groups of parentheses. For each group, we use a stack to keep track of the depth of the parentheses. We update the maximum depth whenever we encounter a '(' and reduce the stack when we encounter a ')'. The maximum depth at any point is the size of the stack. This approach ensures that we get the maximum depth of the parentheses.

We then append this maximum depth to our results list and return it at the end.

For example, calling parseNestedParens("(()()) ((())) () ((())()())") will return [2, 3, 1, 3].

This solution assumes that the input string is well-formed and does not contain any invalid characters.

The time complexity is O(n), where n is the total number of characters in the string. The space complexity is also O(n), as in the worst case, we store the entire string in memory.
