This solution will work for any number of parentheses groups and any depth of nesting. It splits the input string into groups by spaces, then iterates over each group and counts the number of open parentheses. If this count is greater than the maximum count seen so far, it updates the maximum. This maximum is the depth of nesting for the group.

Please note that this solution assumes that the input string is well-formed and does not contain any other types of characters. If the input string could contain other characters, you would need to add error checking to handle those cases.

Here is the time complexity of this solution. The outer loop iterates over each group in the string, and the inner loop iterates over each character in the group. So the time complexity is O(n), where n is the total number of characters in all groups. The space complexity is O(m), where m is the number of groups. This is because we are storing the maximum depth of nesting for each group in a list.

A: Here is a Python solution for your problem:

```python
def parseNestedParens(s):
    # split the string into groups by spaces
    groups = s.split(" ")

    levels = []

    # iterate over each group
    for group in groups:
        count = 0
        max_count = 0
        # iterate over each character in the group
        for char in group:
            if char == '(':
                count += 1
                if count > max_count:
                    max_count =
