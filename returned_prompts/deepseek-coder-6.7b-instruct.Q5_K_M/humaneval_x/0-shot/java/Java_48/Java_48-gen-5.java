        if (text.equals("")) {
            return true;
        }
        int length = text.length();
        for (int i = 0; i < length / 2; i++) {
            if (text.charAt(i) != text.charAt(length - i - 1)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}

This solution uses a for loop to compare the first and last characters of the string, then the second and second last characters, and so on, until it reaches the middle of the string. If all pairs of characters match, the string is a palindrome and the function returns true. If any pair doesn't match, the function returns false.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because the function makes n / 2 comparisons (each pair of characters in the string). The space complexity is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of extra space.

Test this solution by calling the isPalindrome method with different strings and printing the result. For example:

```
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Solution solution = new Solution();
    System.out.println(solution.isPalindrome("")); // true
    System.out.println(solution.isPalindrome("aba")); // true
    System.out.println(solution.isPalindrome("aaaaa")); // true
    System.out.println(solution.isPalindrome("zbcd")); // false
}
```

This will print:

```
true
true
true
false
```

which verifies the expected results.

This solution assumes that the input string is in lowercase and doesn't contain any punctuation or special characters. If the input string could contain uppercase letters or punctuation, you would need to add additional code to handle these cases.

Please note that this solution uses the equals method to compare strings, which is case sensitive. If you want to ignore case, you can convert the entire string to lowercase or uppercase before comparing it.

Also, if you want to ignore spaces or other characters, you can remove them from the string before comparing it.

I hope
