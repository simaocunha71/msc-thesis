        int i = 0, j = text.length() - 1;
        while (i < j) {
            if (text.charAt(i) != text.charAt(j))
                return false;
            i++;
            j--;
        }
        return true;
    }
}

Here is the correct solution. The logic behind this solution is to compare the first character of the string with the last character, then the second character with the second last character and so on. If we find any pair that doesn't match, we return false. If we complete the string without finding any pair that doesn't match, we return true.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), where n is the length of the string.

It's also worth noting that this solution is case-sensitive, so "Aba" would not be considered a palindrome.

This is a common solution for checking if a string is a palindrome. It works by comparing the characters in the string from both ends towards the center, moving inward.

The solution uses a while loop to iterate over the string, comparing characters at the ends of the string and moving towards the center. The loop continues until it has checked all pairs of characters, or it finds a pair of characters that do not match. If it finds a pair of characters that do not match, it returns false. If it finishes checking all pairs of characters without finding a mismatch, it returns true.

This solution assumes that the input string is not null. If the input string could be null, you should add a null check at the beginning of the method to handle that case.

This solution also assumes that the input string contains only valid characters. If the input string could contain invalid characters, you should add a check to ignore or handle those characters.

In conclusion, this solution is a straightforward and efficient way to check if a string is a palindrome.
