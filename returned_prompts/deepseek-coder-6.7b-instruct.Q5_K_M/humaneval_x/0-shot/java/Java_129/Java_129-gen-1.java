I am trying to solve this problem by using Dijkstra's Algorithm but I am not sure how to correctly implement it.
This is my current approach:
1. Create a priority queue to store the cells that we have to visit.
2. For each cell, calculate its cost to reach the end.
3. The cost of reaching the end is the sum of the values of the cells we have to pass through, multiplied by the number of cells we have to pass through.
4. Visit the cell with the minimum cost first.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until we have visited k cells.
6. Return the list of cells that we have visited.

However, this approach does not work because the cells we have to pass through are not unique. Therefore, I cannot use a set to store the cells that we have visited.

How can I modify my approach to correctly implement Dijkstra's Algorithm?

A: Dijkstra's algorithm works by tracking the shortest distance from the start node to all other nodes in the graph. However, in this case, it seems you're trying to find the minimum path in a grid, where you can move in any of the 4 directions (up, down, left, right) from a node to any of its neighbors. This is more of a breadth-first search problem than a graph problem. 

Your approach is on the right track, you just need to slightly modify it. Instead of using a priority queue to store the unvisited nodes, use a queue. You also need a 3D array to track the minimum path cost to each cell from the starting cell.

Here's a high-level pseudo code of how you can implement this:

```
1. Initialize a 3D array dp[i][j][k] to store the minimum path cost from the start cell to cell (i, j) with k cells visited. Initialize dp[start_i][start_j][0] to be the value at the start cell.

2. Initialize a queue to store the cells to visit. Start by adding the start cell to the queue.

3. While the queue is not empty:
   1. Pop the cell with the minimum path cost from the queue.
   2. If this cell is the target cell and
