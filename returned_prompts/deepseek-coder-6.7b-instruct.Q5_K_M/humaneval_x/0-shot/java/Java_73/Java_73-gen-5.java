        int n = arr.size();
        int count = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i <= n/2; i++){
            if (arr.get(i) != arr.get(n-i-1)){
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}

This solution works by iterating through the list from both ends, comparing the elements at the current index and its corresponding index from the end of the list. If they are not equal, it counts this as a change needed to make the array palindromic, then continues to the next pair of elements. This continues until it has checked all the necessary pairs. Finally, it returns the count of changes needed.

In terms of time complexity, this solution has a O(n) complexity because it only needs to iterate through the list once.

In terms of space complexity, this solution also has a O(1) complexity because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the input list and the variables count and n.

So, the solution is efficient both in terms of time and space complexity.

This solution assumes that the input list is not null and contains at least one element. If the input list can be null or empty, then more error checking should be added to the solution.

The solution also assumes that the elements of the list are integers. If the elements of the list are not integers, then the solution should be modified to handle this case.

A: Here is the code for the question:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> arr = Arrays.asList(1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6);
        System.out.println(smallestChange(arr));
    }

    static int smallestChange(List<Integer> arr){
        int n = arr.size();
        int count = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < n/2; i++){
            if (arr.get(i) != arr.get(n-i-1)){
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
