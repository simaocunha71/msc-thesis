A: The answer provided is correct. Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

The problem requires us to find the minimum number of changes to be made in the array to make it a palindrome. A palindrome is a sequence that remains the same when reversed.

In the solution, we start by initializing two pointers, 'left' and 'right', to the beginning and end of the array respectively. We then enter a while loop that continues until 'left' is less than 'right'. Inside the loop, we first check if the elements at the 'left' and 'right' indices are not equal. If they are not equal, we increment 'changes' by 1. This represents the change of an element to make the array palindromic. Finally, we increment 'left' by 1 and decrement 'right' by 1 to move towards the center of the array.

When the loop ends, we return 'changes', which represents the minimum number of changes to be made to make the array palindromic. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the size of the array.

Note: This solution assumes that the input list is not null and has at least one element.

Here's a more detailed explanation of the code:

- Initialize 'changes' to 0. This variable will keep track of the number of changes made to the array to make it palindromic.
- Initialize 'left' and 'right' to the start and end of the array respectively.
- Start a while loop that continues until 'left' is less than 'right'.
- Inside the loop, check if the elements at the 'left' and 'right' indices are not equal. If they are not equal, increment 'changes' by 1.
- Finally, increment 'left' by 1 and decrement 'right' by 1 to move towards the center of the array.
