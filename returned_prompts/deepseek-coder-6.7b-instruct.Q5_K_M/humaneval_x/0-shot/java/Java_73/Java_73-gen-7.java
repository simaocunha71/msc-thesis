        int count = 0;
        int n = arr.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) {
            if (arr.get(i) != arr.get(n - i - 1)) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}

Explanation:
The solution works by checking each pair of corresponding elements from the start and end of the array. If the elements are not equal, it increments the count. Finally, it returns the count, which represents the minimum number of changes needed to make the array palindromic.

In the first example, the array is not already palindromic, so the changes needed are [1, 2, 3, 5, 5, 3, 2, 1]. The first pair of elements that are not equal are 1 and 9, so we change 1 to 9. The next pair are 2 and 6, so we change 2 to 6. The next pair are 3 and 7, so we change 3 to 7. The last pair are 5 and 4, so we change 5 to 4. After these changes, the array is palindromic.

In the second example, the array is already palindromic, so no changes are needed.

In the third example, the array is already palindromic, so no changes are needed.

// This solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), where n is the size of the array.

// This solution assumes that the input list is not null and contains at least one element. If this is not the case, additional error checking should be added.

// This solution also assumes that the input list contains only integers. If this is not the case, additional type checking should be added.

// This solution uses the Java List interface, which provides methods for manipulating lists of objects. The solution uses the get(int index) method to access elements in the list, and the size() method to get the size of the list.

// This solution uses a simple for loop to iterate through the first half of the list, comparing each element with its corresponding element from the end of the list.
