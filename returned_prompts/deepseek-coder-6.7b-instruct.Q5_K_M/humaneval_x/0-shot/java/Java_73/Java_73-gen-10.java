        int n = arr.size();
        int changes = 0;

        for(int i=0; i<n/2; i++){
            if(arr.get(i) != arr.get(n-1-i)){
                changes++;
            }
        }

        return changes;
    }
}

This solution works by iterating over the first half of the array and comparing each element to its corresponding element from the end. If the elements are different, a change is made. The number of changes is returned as the result.

Here is the explanation of the code:
1. The function takes a list of integers as input.
2. The number of elements in the list is stored in the variable n.
3. A counter variable 'changes' is initialized to 0.
4. The loop iterates over the first half of the array. For each element at index i, it compares it with the corresponding element from the end of the array at index n-1-i. 
5. If these elements are not equal, the counter 'changes' is incremented.
6. After the loop ends, the function returns the value of 'changes', which is the minimum number of changes needed to make the array palindromic.
7. If the array is already palindromic (i.e., the number of changes is 0), the function returns 0.
