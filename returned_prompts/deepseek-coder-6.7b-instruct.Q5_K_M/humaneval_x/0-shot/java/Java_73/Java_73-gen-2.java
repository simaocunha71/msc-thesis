        int changes = 0;
        int i = 0, j = arr.size() - 1;
        while (i < j) {
            if (arr.get(i) != arr.get(j)) {
                changes++;
            }
            i++;
            j--;
        }
        return changes;
    }
}

This program works by iterating from both ends of the array, comparing the elements at the current positions. If the elements are not equal, it increments the change counter. It then moves the indices inward to compare the next pair of elements. This continues until it has checked all pairs of elements. The total number of changes (or minimum number of changes to make the array palindromic) is then returned.

}

In the Main class, we take the size of the array and the array elements from the user. We then create an instance of the Solution class and call the smallestChange method, passing the array as an argument. The method returns the minimum number of changes required to make the array palindromic, which is then printed to the console.

Note: This code assumes that the size of the array and the elements of the array are integers.
