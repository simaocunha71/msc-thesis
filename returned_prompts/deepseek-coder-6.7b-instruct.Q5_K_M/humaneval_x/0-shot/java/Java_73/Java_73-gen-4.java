        int changes = 0;
        int left = 0;
        int right = arr.size() - 1;

        while (left <= right) {
            if (arr.get(left) != arr.get(right)) {
                changes++;
            }

The solution works by comparing elements from the start and the end of the array, moving inward until they meet in the middle. If the elements are not equal, it counts this as a change needed to make the array palindromic, and moves on to the next pair of elements.

The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the size of the array, as it only needs to iterate over the array once. The space complexity is O(1), as it uses a constant amount of space to store the indices and the count of changes.

Note: This solution assumes that the input list is not null and its size is at least 1. If there's a chance the input could be null or empty, you should add a null or empty check at the start of the method.

A: It seems like the question is asking for a function that counts the number of changes needed to make an array palindrome. A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same backwards as forwards. 

Here is the code in Python:

```python
def smallestChange(arr):
    changes = 0
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1

    while left <= right:
        if arr[left] != arr[right]:
            changes += 1
        left += 1
        right -= 1

    return changes
```

This function works by comparing the elements at the beginning and the end of the array. If they're not equal, it counts this as a change needed. It then moves to the next pair of elements and repeats the process until it has checked all pairs.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the size of the array. This is because it only needs to iterate over the array once. The space complexity is O(1), as it uses a constant amount of space to store the indices and the count of
