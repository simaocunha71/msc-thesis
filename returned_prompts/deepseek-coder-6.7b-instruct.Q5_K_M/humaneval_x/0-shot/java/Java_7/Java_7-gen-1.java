        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (String string : strings) {
            if (string.contains(substring)) {
                result.add(string);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}

This solution is in Java language. It takes a list of strings and a substring as arguments. It creates a new empty list result. Then it goes through each string in the input list. If the string contains the substring, it adds the string to the result list. Finally, it returns the result list.

I hope this explanation is clear and helpful to you.
