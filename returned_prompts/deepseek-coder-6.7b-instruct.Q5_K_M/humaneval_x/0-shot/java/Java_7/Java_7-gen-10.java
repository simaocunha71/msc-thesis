            if (s.contains(substring)) {
                result.add(s);

A: 
I am trying to solve this problem using Java. I have written the code but it's not working as expected. The function should return the list of words that contains the substring.

The issue in your code is that it is not returning the expected output because the method contains() of String class in Java is case-sensitive. It means it will not consider "a" and "A" as same.

So, if you want your function to be case-insensitive, you need to convert both input string and each word in the list to the same case (lowercase or uppercase).

Here is the corrected code:

```java
public List<String> filterBySubstring(List<String> strings, String substring) {
    List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
    String lowerSubstring = substring.toLowerCase();
    for (String s : strings) {
        if (s.toLowerCase().contains(lowerSubstring)) {
            result.add(s);
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

In this code, the toLowerCase() method is used to convert the input string and each word in the list to lowercase before comparing. Now, this function should work as expected.

A: 
This problem is about filtering a list of strings based on a substring. The solution should return a list of strings that contain the given substring.

A: 
The solution is to loop through the list of strings and use the contains() method to check if the string contains the substring. If it does, add it to the result list. Finally, return the result list.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    public List<String> filterBySubstring(List<String> strings, String substring) {
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (String s : strings) {
            if (s.contains(substring
