        List<String> filteredStrings = new ArrayList<>();
        for (String string : strings) {
            if (string.contains(substring)) {
                filteredStrings.add(string);
            }
        }
        return filteredStrings;
    }
}

This solution uses Java's built-in List interface and the ArrayList class to implement a method that filters a list of strings to only those strings that contain a given substring. This solution loops over the input list of strings, and if the string contains the given substring, it adds the string to the output list. The output list is then returned.

This solution is correct, but it has a time complexity of O(n*m) where n is the length of the list and m is the length of the longest string in the list. This is because for each string in the list, the method checks if it contains the substring, which takes O(m) time. Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n*m).

In terms of space complexity, the solution is O(k) where k is the number of strings that contain the substring. This is because we store those strings in the output list. Therefore, the space complexity is proportional to the number of strings that contain the substring.

Overall, this solution is efficient for small to medium-sized lists of strings. For very large lists of strings, you may want to consider a more efficient method of filtering strings that contains the substring.

Note: This solution assumes that the input list is not null and that the substring is not null or empty. If these assumptions do not hold, you should add appropriate error checking to the method.
