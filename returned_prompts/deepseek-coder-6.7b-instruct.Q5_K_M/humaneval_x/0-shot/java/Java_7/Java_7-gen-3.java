        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (String str : strings) {
            if (str.contains(substring)) {
                result.add(str);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}

This is a simple solution to the problem. It creates a new ArrayList to store the filtered strings. It then loops through the input list, checking if each string contains the given substring. If it does, it adds the string to the result list. Finally, it returns the result list.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n*m), where n is the number of strings in the list and m is the length of the longest string. This is because for each string in the list, it checks if it contains the substring, which takes O(m) time.

The space complexity is O(k), where k is the number of strings that contain the given substring. This is because it creates a new list to store the result.

This solution assumes that the input list is not null and the substring is not null or empty. If the input list can be null or the substring can be null or empty, you should add null checks before processing the list.

This solution is case-sensitive. If you want it to be case-insensitive, you can convert both the string and substring to lowercase or uppercase before checking if they contain the substring.

This solution does not handle special characters or non-alphabetic characters in the strings or substring. If you need to handle these cases, you will need to modify the solution to handle these cases.

This solution does not handle the case where the substring is at the beginning or end of the string. If you need to handle these cases, you can modify the solution to check if the substring is at the beginning or end of the string.

This solution does not handle the case where the substring is empty. If you need to handle this case, you can modify the solution to check if the substring is empty.

This solution does not handle the case where the input list contains null strings. If you need to handle this case, you can modify the solution to handle null strings.

This solution does not handle the case where the input list is very large. If you need to handle this case, you can modify the solution to process the
