This code uses a priority queue to keep track of the water levels in each well. Each time it empties a well, it reduces the water level by 1 and adds the remaining water back to the queue. This continues until all wells are emptied. The number of times the buckets need to be lowered is then returned.

Please note that this code assumes that each well contains the same amount of water at the start. If the wells contain different amounts of water, the code will not work correctly.

Also, this code assumes that all wells are initially full. If some wells are not full, the code will not work correctly.

Lastly, this code does not take into account the fact that the buckets can only hold a certain amount of water at a time. If this is a concern, the code will need to be modified accordingly.

I hope this helps. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask.

//C:
/*
In the given problem, we are given a rectangular grid of wells. Each row in the grid represents a well, and each 1 in a row represents a unit of water. We need to use a bucket to empty the wells.

The task is to find out the minimum number of times the bucket needs to be lowered. The bucket can only hold a certain amount of water at a time, which is given as the bucket_capacity.

Here, we are
