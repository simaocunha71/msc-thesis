        int sum = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<k; i++){
            if(arr.get(i) <= 99 && arr.get(i) >=10){
                sum += arr.get(i);
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}


A: The problem can be solved by iterating through the first k elements of the array, checking each of them to see if it is a two-digit number (between 10 and 99 inclusive), and if so, adding it to a running total.

Here is the Java code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    public int addElements(List<Integer> arr, int k) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            if (arr.get(i) >= 10 && arr.get(i) <= 99) {
                sum += arr.get(i);
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

In this code, the `addElements` function takes as input a `List<Integer>` and an integer `k`. It then iterates over the first `k` elements of the list. If the current element is a two-digit number (between 10 and 99 inclusive), it adds it to the `sum`. Finally, it returns the `sum`.

The time complexity of this solution is O(k) as it only needs to iterate through the first `k` elements of the array once. The space complexity is O(1) as it only uses a single integer to keep track of the sum.

I hope this helps in understanding the problem and the solution. Let me know if you have any further questions.
