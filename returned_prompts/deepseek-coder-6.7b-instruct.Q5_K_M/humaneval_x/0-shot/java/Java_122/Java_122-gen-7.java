        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            if (arr.get(i).toString().length() <= 2) {
                sum += arr.get(i);
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}

This is my code, but it's not working as expected, it seems I'm missing something.

A: The error in your code is because you are converting the integer to a string and then checking the length of the string. This is unnecessary because you can directly count the number of digits in an integer.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    public int addElements(List<Integer> arr, int k) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            if ((int)Math.log10(arr.get(i)) + 1 <= 2) {
                sum += arr.get(i);
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

In this code, `(int)Math.log10(arr.get(i)) + 1` is used to count the number of digits in the integer `arr.get(i)`. The `Math.log10(n)` function returns the base-10 logarithm of `n`, and adding 1 to it gives the number of digits. The `(int)` is used to cast the result to an integer, effectively rounding down to the nearest whole number.

This should give the correct result.

Note: This solution assumes that all elements in the list are positive. If there can be negative numbers in the list, you would need to add an additional check to handle this.


A: The problem is in the line where you're converting the integer to a string and then checking its length. You can avoid this by using logarithms to count the number of digits in the integer. 

Here is the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    public int addElements(List<Integer> arr, int k) {
