        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            if (arr.get(i) >= 0 && arr.get(i) <= 99) {
                sum += arr.get(i);
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}

In this solution, we are iterating over the first k elements of the input array. If the current element is between 0 and 99 (inclusive), we add it to our sum. We then return the sum.

This solution has a time complexity of O(k) as we are only iterating over the first k elements. Its space complexity is O(1) as we are not using any additional space that scales with the input size.

Please replace the arr and k in the function call with your actual input values.
