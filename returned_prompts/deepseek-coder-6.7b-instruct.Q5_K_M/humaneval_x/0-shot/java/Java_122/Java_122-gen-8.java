        int sum = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < k; i++){
            if(String.valueOf(arr.get(i)).length() <= 2){
                sum += arr.get(i);
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}

This solution works by iterating through the first k elements of the array, and for each element, it converts the integer into a string and checks the length of this string. If the length of the string is less than or equal to 2, the element is added to the sum. This is done using the String.valueOf method to convert the integer to a string and the length method to get the length of the string. Finally, the sum is returned.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) because it iterates through the first k elements of the array once, where n is the size of the array. The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a single variable to keep track of the sum.

Please note that the problem statement is not entirely clear. It says "the sum of the elements with at most two digits from the first k elements of arr." But in the example, it says "sum of 21 + 3". If it's supposed to be the sum of the elements with at most two digits from the first k elements of arr, then the solution provided should work. If not, please provide the correct problem statement.
