public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        System.out.println(solution.circularShift(12, 1)); // "21"
        System.out.println(solution.circularShift(12, 2)); // "12"
    }
}

```

This solution works by converting the integer to a string, then using a StringBuilder to manipulate the string. If the shift is greater than the number of digits in the integer, the StringBuilder is reversed. Otherwise, the string is divided into two parts at the point where the shift would occur, and the two parts are swapped.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of digits in the integer. The space complexity is also O(n) because of the use of the StringBuilder to store the string representation of the integer.

Note: The question states "shift the digits right by shift", but the example shows "shift the digits left by shift". I assumed that you meant to shift the digits right by shift, so I adjusted the solution accordingly.
