        String str = Integer.toString(x);
        int len = str.length();

        if (shift >= len) {
            return new StringBuilder(str).reverse().toString();
        }

        String left = str.substring(0, len - shift);
        String right = str.substring(len - shift, len);

        return right + left;
    }
}

The above solution works by first converting the integer to a string. It then checks if the shift is greater than or equal to the number of digits in the string. If it is, it reverses the string and returns it.

If the shift is less than the number of digits in the string, it splits the string into two parts - the right part of length `shift` and the left part of length `len - shift`. It then concatenates the right part with the left part to get the circularly shifted string.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of digits in the integer.

The space complexity is also O(n), because we are storing the string representation of the integer in memory.

So, the overall time and space complexity of the solution is O(n).

This solution assumes that the integer is non-negative. If the integer can be negative, the solution would need to be adapted accordingly.
