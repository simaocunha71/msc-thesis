        int count = 0;

        for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++){
            if(i == 1 || i == n)
                count += 8 * Math.pow(9, n-2);
            else
                count += 9 * Math.pow(9, n-2);

    }
}

My answer is a bit off. I understand why the problem is asking for the count of n-digit numbers that start or end with 1, but I don't understand the reasoning behind the 8 and 9 calculation in the given solution. Can you explain?

A: The number of n-digit numbers starting or ending with 1 is 8*9^(n-2).

Let's break this down:

8 comes from the fact that there are two possibilities for the first digit: 1 and any other digit from 0 to 9. And there are two possibilities for the last digit: 1 and any other digit from 0 to 9.

9^(n-2) comes from the fact that for the remaining (n-2) digits, there are 10 possible digits (0 to 9), so 10^(n-2) possibilities.

So, the total number of n-digit numbers that start or end with 1 is 2 * 10^(n-2) because for the first digit there are 2 possibilities (1 or any other digit from 0 to 9) and for the last digit there are also 2 possibilities (1 or any other digit from 0 to 9).

But as per the question, it is asking for numbers that start or end with 1. So, we have to subtract those numbers which start and end with 0.

So, the final answer is 8 * 9^(n-2).

I hope this explanation makes sense. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.

A: The calculation is based on the fact that for any given n-digit number, there are 10 possible digits (0-9), except for the first and last digits which can only be 1. 

For the first digit, there are
