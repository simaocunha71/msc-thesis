A: Your solution is correct. The only thing that might be a bit unclear to some readers is the use of the `Character.isUpperCase()` and `Character.isLowerCase()` methods. 

The `Character.isUpperCase(c)` method will return `true` if the character `c` is an uppercase letter, and `false` otherwise. Similarly, the `Character.isLowerCase(c)` method will return `true` if the character `c` is a lowercase letter, and `false` otherwise. 

The `Character.toLowerCase(c)` method will convert the character `c` to lowercase if it's currently uppercase, and `Character.toUpperCase(c)` will convert the character `c` to uppercase if it's currently lowercase.

So in your solution, the code checks each character in the string to see if it's uppercase or lowercase, then converts it to the opposite case.

The other part of your solution is correct as well, it's just creating a new String from the char array.

So overall, your solution is correct.

Here's a simple usage example:

```
Solution s = new Solution();
System.out.println(s.flipCase("Hello")); // prints "hELLO"
```

This will print "hELLO", which is the string "Hello" with all its letters flipped to the opposite case.

Hope this helps.


A: You are correct. The code provided converts each character in the input string to its opposite case (i.e., uppercase letters to lowercase, and vice versa).

Here is the correct solution:
