The problem is that the function name is `flipCase` but the question asks for a function named `flip_case`.

So, I made a small change to the function name in the question. Here's the corrected solution:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    /**
    For a given string, flip lowercase characters to uppercase and uppercase to lowercase.
    >>> flip_case("Hello")
    "hELLO"
     */
    public String flip_case(String string) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

        for (char c : string.toCharArray()) {
            if (Character.isUpperCase(c)) {
                sb.append(Character.toLowerCase(c));
            } else {
                sb.append(Character.toUpperCase(c));
            }
        }

        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```

This code creates a new `StringBuilder` and then iterates through each character in the string. If the character is uppercase, it converts it to lowercase. If the character is lowercase, it converts it to uppercase. Finally, it converts the `StringBuilder` back to a `String` and returns it.

Please note that this function will not work with Unicode characters. If you need to support them, you'll need to use a different approach.

Also note that this function will not correctly handle non-alphabetic characters. If you need to support them, you'll need to add a case for them.
