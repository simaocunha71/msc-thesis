        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 1; i < xs.size(); i++) {
            result.add(xs.get(i) * i);
        }
        return result;
    }
}

This solution works by iterating through the input list from the second element onwards. For each element, it multiplies it by its index (which is the power of x in the polynomial), and adds it to the result.

The first element of the result is always 0, as the constant term does not have a derivative.

This solution assumes that the input list is non-empty, as the problem statement does not specify what should happen in this case.

It also assumes that the input list contains integers. If the input list can contain non-integer elements, the solution needs to be modified accordingly.

Please note that this solution does not handle the case where the input list contains negative numbers or zero. If these cases are possible, the solution would need to be modified to handle them.

Also note that this solution does not handle the case where the input list contains floating-point numbers. If this case is possible, the solution would need to be modified to handle it.

Finally, this solution assumes that the input list is immutable. If the input list can be modified, the solution would need to be modified to handle this.

Overall, this solution is a good starting point, but it may need to be modified to handle the specific requirements of your problem.
