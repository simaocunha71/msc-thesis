        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for(int i = 1; i < xs.size(); i++){
            result.add(xs.get(i) * i);
        }
        return result;
    }
}

This problem is a simple one, you just need to loop through the list and multiply each element by its index. The result is the derivative of the polynomial, as per the formula of the derivative of a polynomial.

Note: The index in Java starts from 0, so the first element in the list is at index 0, which is not in the formula of a derivative of a polynomial, so we start from the second element (index 1). And for each element in the list, its index (i) represents the power of x in the polynomial, so we multiply it by this index to get the derivative.

// Time complexity: O(n), n is the size of the list.
// Space complexity: O(n), n is the size of the list.
// This is because we create a new list to store the result. In the worst case, the size of the new list is the same as the size of the input list.

// The time complexity is O(n) because we have to go through the list once. The space complexity is O(n) because in the worst case, we have to store the result in a new list.
// The space complexity can be O(1) if we modify the input list instead of creating a new one, but that's not required in this problem.

// This solution is correct and efficient. It's a good example of how to solve problems
