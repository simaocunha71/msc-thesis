        ArrayList<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();
        for(int i = 1; i < xs.size(); i++){
            res.add(xs.get(i) * i);
        }
        return res;
    }
}


A: You can solve this problem using a simple for loop to iterate over the elements of the input list. In each iteration, you will multiply the coefficient of the current term by its power (which is the index), then add the result to a new list.

Here is the Java code to solve this problem:

```java
public List<Integer> derivative(List<Integer> xs) {
    List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();
    for(int i = 1; i < xs.size(); i++){
        res.add(xs.get(i) * i);
    }
    return res;
}
```

This code will iterate over the elements of the input list from the second element (index 1) to the end of the list. For each element, it multiplies the coefficient (value at the current index in the list xs) by its power (the current index), then adds the result to the new list res. The result is the derivative of the input polynomial, represented as a list of coefficients in the same order.

The time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the number of terms in the polynomial, because it performs one operation (multiplication and addition) for each term in the polynomial. The space complexity is also O(n), because it creates a new list to store the coefficients of the derivative polynomial.

Please note that this code assumes that the input list xs represents a polynomial with integer coefficients and non-negative powers. If the input list does not meet these assumptions, the code may not work correctly.

Also, if you need to handle cases where the input list represents a polynomial with real coefficients and non-negative powers, you may need to modify the code to handle floating-point arithmetic and possibly to handle round-off errors.

Lastly, if you need to handle cases where the input list represents a polynomial with coefficients that are not integers, you may need to modify the code to handle floating-point arithmetic and possibly to handle round-off errors.

I hope this helps, and let me
