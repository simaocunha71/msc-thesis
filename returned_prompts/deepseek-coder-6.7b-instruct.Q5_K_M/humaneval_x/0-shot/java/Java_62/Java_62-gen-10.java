The solution is straightforward, we just need to iterate over the list of coefficients, starting from the second one, and for each coefficient multiply it by its index (i), as per the rule of differentiation. This gives us the coefficients of the derivative. 

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), and the space complexity is also O(n), where n is the number of coefficients in the polynomial.
