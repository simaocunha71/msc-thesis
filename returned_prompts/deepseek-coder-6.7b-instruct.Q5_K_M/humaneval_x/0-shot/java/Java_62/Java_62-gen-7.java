        List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();
        for(int i = 1; i < xs.size(); i++) {
            res.add(xs.get(i) * i);
        }
        return res;
    }
}

In this solution, we are iterating over the list from the index 1 (since we are not interested in the constant term), and for each index, we are multiplying the coefficient with the index (which is the power of x) and adding it to the result list. 

We are not using the index 0 as it does not contribute to the derivative.

So, if we have a polynomial like 3 + 2x + 6x^2 + 20x^3 + 30x^4, its derivative will be 2 + 4x + 12x^2 + 60x^3. And in the form of a list, it will be [2, 4, 12, 60]. 

The index i represents the power of x in the polynomial, so we multiply the coefficient with the index i to get the derivative.

For example, in the list [3, 2, 6, 20, 30], the coefficient of x^2 is 6, and its index is 2. So we multiply 6 by 2 to get the derivative of x^2, which is 12.

This way, we get the entire derivative of the polynomial.
