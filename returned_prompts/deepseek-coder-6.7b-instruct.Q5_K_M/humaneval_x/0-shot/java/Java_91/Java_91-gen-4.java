        int count = 0;
        String[] sentences = S.split("[.?!]");

        for (String sentence : sentences) {
            if (!sentence.trim().isEmpty() && sentence.trim().charAt(0) == 'I') {
                count++;
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
}

The solution is straightforward, it splits the input string into an array of sentences by using the split method and then it goes through each sentence to check if it starts with 'I'. If it does, it increases the count. Finally, it returns the count.

Please note that this solution assumes that there are no leading, trailing, or duplicate spaces in the input string. If that's not the case, you might want to trim the sentences before checking if they start with 'I'.

Also, this solution assumes that the input string is properly formatted, i.e., it ends with '.', '?' or '!' before the last sentence. If that's not the case, you might want to add a special handling for the last sentence.

This solution also assumes that the input string is in English and the sentences are written in the imperative mood. If that's not the case, you might want to adjust the solution accordingly.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because it goes through each character of the string once. It has a space complexity of O(n), because it creates an array of sentences.

A: The problem description is not clear, but it seems like you want to count the number of sentences starting with "I". Here's a simple solution in Java:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int isBored(String S) {
        int count = 0;
        String[] sentences = S.split("[.?!]");

        for (String sentence : sentences) {
            if (!sentence.trim().isEmpty() && sentence.trim().charAt(0) == 'I') {
                count++;
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```

This code splits the input string into an array of sentences using the split method. It then goes through each sentence and checks if it starts with '
