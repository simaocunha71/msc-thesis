        int boredomCounter = 0;
        String[] sentences = S.split("[.?!]");

        for(String sentence : sentences){
            if(sentence.trim().length() > 0 && sentence.trim().charAt(0) == 'I'){
                boredomCounter++;
            }
        }

        return boredomCounter;
    }
}


A: The code is almost correct. You are splitting the string into sentences using a regular expression which is correct but you forgot to include the space after the split character. Here is the corrected version of your code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution  {
    public int isBored(String S)  {
        int boredomCounter = 0;
        String[] sentences = S.split("[.?!] ");

        for(String sentence : sentences){
            if(sentence.trim().length() > 0 && sentence.trim().charAt(0) == 'I'){
                boredomCounter++;
            }
        }

        return boredomCounter;
    }
}
```

In this code, the split function splits the string into an array of sentences. The regular expression "[.?!] " splits the string into sentences wherever there is a '.', '?', or '!' followed by a space. Then we iterate over each sentence and check if it starts with "I". If it does, we increment the boredomCounter. Finally, we return the boredomCounter which is the total number of sentences in the string that start with "I".

Test it with:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Solution solution = new Solution();
    System.out.println(solution.isBored("Hello world"));  // Outputs 0
    System.out.println(solution.isBored("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather"));  // Outputs 1
}
```

This should print 0 and 1 as output respectively.

I hope this helps.
