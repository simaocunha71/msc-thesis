        int count = 0;
        String[] sentences = S.split("[.?!]");
        for (String sentence : sentences) {
            if (sentence.trim().length() > 0 && sentence.trim().charAt(0) == 'I') {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}

This solution works by splitting the input string into sentences using the split method with the regex "[.?!]". It then iterates over the resulting array of sentences, and if a sentence is non-empty and starts with the letter 'I', it increments the count. Finally, it returns the count.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the length of the input string, because it scans the string once to split it into sentences and then once more to count the sentences that start with 'I'.

And space complexity of O(n) because in the worst case, each sentence in the string can be a separate string in the array.

This solution assumes that the input string only contains valid sentences and does not contain any invalid characters or punctuation that could interfere with the sentence splitting.

A: If you're looking for a solution in Python, you can use the re (regular expression) module to split the sentences. Then, count the number of sentences that start with 'I'.

Here's the Python code:

```python
import re

def isBored(S):
    sentences = re.split('[.?!]', S)
    return sum(1 for sentence in sentences if sentence.strip().startswith('I'))
```

This code works by using the re.split function to split the input string into a list of sentences, using '[.?!]' as the delimiter. It then uses a generator expression to count the number of sentences that start with 'I'. The sum function adds up these counts to give the total number of sentences that start with 'I'.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the length of the input string, because it scans the string once to split it into sentences and then once more to count the sentences that start with 'I'.

And space complexity of O(n) because in the worst case, each sentence in the string can be
