        int count = 0;
        String[] sentences = S.split("[.?!]");

        for (String sentence : sentences) {
            if (sentence.trim().startsWith("I")) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}

This solution works by splitting the input string into an array of sentences using the split method, which uses a regular expression to delimit sentences by '.', '?' or '!' characters. It then iterates over each sentence, trims any leading or trailing whitespace, and checks if it starts with the word "I". If it does, it increments a count. Finally, it returns the count.

This solution assumes that the input string will not contain any other '.', '?' or '!' characters. If the input string can contain these characters, the solution should be modified to handle these cases.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because the solution iterates over each character in the string once. The space complexity is also O(n) because the solution uses an array to store the sentences.

Please let me know if you have any questions about this solution.

A: Your question is a bit unclear. Are you asking for a way to identify if a string starts with the word "I"? If so, here's a simple example in Java:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str = "I am bored";
        if (str.toLowerCase().startsWith("i")) {
            System.out.println("String starts with 'I'");
        } else {
            System.out.println("String does not start with 'I'");
        }
    }
}
```

In this code, the `toLowerCase()` method is used to make the comparison case-insensitive (it converts all characters in the string to lower case). If the string starts with 'I', it prints "String starts with 'I'", otherwise it prints "String does not start with 'I'".

If you mean something else by "boredoms", please provide more context so I can give you a more accurate answer.
