        int boredomCounter = 0;
        String[] sentences = S.split("[.?!]");

        for (String sentence : sentences) {
            if (sentence.trim().startsWith("I")) {
                boredomCounter++;
            }
        }
        return boredomCounter;
    }
}

This solution splits the input string into sentences using the delimiters '.', '?' and '!' and then checks if each sentence starts with the word "I". If it does, it increments the boredom counter. Finally, it returns the count of boredoms.

The time complexity of the solution is O(n) where n is the length of the string S. The space complexity is also O(n) because we are storing all the sentences in an array.

A: The code seems fine, but the issue is in the last closing bracket. It should be like this:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution  {
    /**
    You'll be given a string of words, and your task is to count the number
    of boredoms. A boredom is a sentence that starts with the word “I”.
    Sentences are delimited by ‘.’, ‘?’ or ‘!/

    For example:
    >>> isBored("Hello world")
    0
    >>> isBored("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather")
    1
      */
    public int isBored(String S)  {

        int boredomCounter = 0;
        String[] sentences = S.split("[.?!]");

        for (String sentence : sentences) {
            if (sentence.trim().startsWith("I")) {
                boredomCounter++;
            }
        }
        return boredomCounter;
    }
}
```

This solution splits the input string into sentences using the delimiters ‘.’, ‘?’ and ‘!/’ and then checks if each sentence starts with the word "I". If it does, it increments the boredom counter. Finally, it returns the count of boredoms.

The time complexity of the solution is O
