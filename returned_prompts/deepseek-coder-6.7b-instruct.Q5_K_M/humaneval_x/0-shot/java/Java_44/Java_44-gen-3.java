        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        while(x > 0) {
            sb.append(x % base);
            x /= base;
        }
        return sb.reverse().toString();
    }
}


A: Here is the Java code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    public String changeBase(int x, int base) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        while(x > 0) {
            sb.append(x % base);
            x /= base;
        }
        return sb.reverse().toString();
    }
}
```

This code works by iteratively dividing the input number `x` by the new base and appending the remainder to the end of a StringBuilder. This is repeated until `x` is no longer greater than 0.

The StringBuilder is then reversed and its contents returned as a string. The reason for reversing the StringBuilder is that the conversion is performed from least significant digit to most significant digit, but the final result should be in the opposite order.

For example, if you want to convert the decimal number 8 to base 3, you would divide 8 by 3 and get a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 2. Then you would repeat the process with 2, dividing by 3 and getting a quotient of 0 and a remainder of 2. The final result would be "22" in base 3.

If you want to convert the decimal number 8 to base 2, you would divide 8 by 2 and get a quotient of 4 and a remainder of 0. Then you would repeat the process with 4, dividing by 2 and getting a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 0. Then you would repeat the process with 2, dividing by 2 and getting a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 0. Finally, you would repeat the process with 1, dividing by 2 and getting a quotient of 0 and a remainder of 1. The final result would be "1000" in base 2.

If you want to convert the decimal number 7 to base 2, you would divide 7 by
