        String result = "";
        while(x > 0) {
            result = x % base + result;
            x /= base;
        }
        return result;
    }
}


A: You are correct. The code you posted will convert the number x to the base given by the parameter 'base'. You can simply call the function with the numbers you want to convert and the base as parameters.

For example,

Solution s = new Solution();
System.out.println(s.changeBase(8, 3)); // Outputs: 22
System.out.println(s.changeBase(8, 2)); // Outputs: 1000
System.out.println(s.changeBase(7, 2)); // Outputs: 111

This will print the result of converting the number to the given base. The modulus operator is used to get the remainder when x is divided by the base. This remainder is concatenated to the beginning of the result string. The result of the modulus operation is then used as the new x for the next iteration of the loop. This process continues until x is no longer greater than 0.

The result string is then returned as the result of the function.

Hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other queries.


A: Here is a possible solution:

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(changeBase(8, 3)); // Outputs: 22
        System.out.println(changeBase(8, 2)); // Outputs: 1000
        System.out.println(changeBase(7, 2)); // Outputs: 111
    }
    
    public static String changeBase(int x, int base) {
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        while (x > 0) {
            result.insert(0, x % base);
            x /= base;
        }
        return result.toString();
    }
}

The difference between your original code and this one is that in this version, I used a StringBuilder object to build the result string. StringBuilder is more efficient than concatenating strings in a loop, because it
