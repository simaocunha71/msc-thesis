        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        int quotient = x;
        while (quotient > 0) {
            sb.insert(0, quotient % base);
            quotient = quotient / base;
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }

    public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception {
        Solution s = new Solution();
        System.out.println(s.changeBase(8, 3)); // 22
        System.out.println(s.changeBase(8, 2)); // 1000
        System.out.println(s.changeBase(7, 2)); // 111
    }
}

The solution works by continuously dividing the input number by the base and storing the remainder at the front of a StringBuilder. The process continues until the quotient is zero. At that point, the function returns the string representation of the StringBuilder.

The time complexity of this solution is O(log(n)), where n is the input number. This is because we are dividing the input number by the base in each iteration of the while loop. 

The space complexity of this solution is also O(log(n)) because we are storing the remainder of each division operation in a StringBuilder.

This solution assumes that the input number and base are non-negative integers. If the input is negative, it should be treated as an error and the function should return an error message or throw an exception.

This solution also assumes that the base is less than 10. If the base is 10 or more, it should be treated as an error and the function should return an error message or throw an exception.

Please note that the question seems to be a bit misleading. It says that the base is less than 10, but it also provides an example where the base is 2. It's not clear whether this is a mistake or not.

Also, the question mentions "return string representation after the conversion" but the examples do not match this. The examples show the result as a number, not a string.

Here is the corrected solution:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution  {
    /**
    Change numerical base of input
