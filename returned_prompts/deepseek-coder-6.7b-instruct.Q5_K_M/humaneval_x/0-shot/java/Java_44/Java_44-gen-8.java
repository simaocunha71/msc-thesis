        return Integer.toString(x, base);
    }
}


A: The answer provided is correct. It uses the built-in method to convert an integer to a string in a given base.
However, if you are required to write the conversion manually, here's how you can do it in Java:

```java
public String changeBase(int x, int base) {
    StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
    while (x > 0) {
        result.insert(0, x % base);
        x /= base;
    }
    return result.toString();
}
```
This code converts the integer to a base-10 number first, then converts the base-10 number to the desired base. It does this by repeatedly dividing the number by the base and inserting the remainder at the start of the result string.

This solution assumes that the input number is a non-negative integer and the base is between 2 and 10, as these are the only bases that can be handled by the built-in method.

Please note that this solution is not handling cases where the base is 1, as base 1 is technically not a valid base.

Also, if you are allowed to use libraries, using the built-in method is a more efficient and cleaner solution.

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    public String changeBase(int x, int base) {
        return Integer.toString(x, base);
    }
}
```
This code converts the integer to a string in the given base using the built-in method.
