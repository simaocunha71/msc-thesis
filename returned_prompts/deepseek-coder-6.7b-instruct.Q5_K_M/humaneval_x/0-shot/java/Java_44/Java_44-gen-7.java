A: The question seems to be missing some details. It is asking to convert a number from base 10 to another base. This can be done using the modulus operator to get the remainder when dividing by the base, and then adding that to a StringBuilder. After that, the StringBuilder is reversed and returned.

The code you provided seems to be correct. It will convert a number from base 10 to another base.

Here is an example of how it works:

If you call changeBase(8, 3), it will perform the following steps:


*

*8 % 3 = 2, so it adds "2" to the StringBuilder.

*8 / 3 = 2, so it sets x = 2.

*2 % 3 = 2, so it adds "2" to the StringBuilder.

*2 / 3 = 0, so it stops the loop.

*The StringBuilder is reversed to "22", and the function returns "22".


So, the function is correctly converting a number from base 10 to another base.

If you meant to ask about a different question, could you please provide more details?

A: The question seems to be about converting a decimal number to another base. If that's the case, you can use the modulo operator to get the remainder of the division by the base you're converting to, and then append this remainder to a StringBuilder. After that, the StringBuilder is reversed and returned.

Here is the code:
public String changeBase(int x, int base) {
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    while (x > 0) {
