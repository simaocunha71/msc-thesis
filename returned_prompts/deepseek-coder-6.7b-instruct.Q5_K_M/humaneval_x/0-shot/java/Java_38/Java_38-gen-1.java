    // split string to groups. Each of length 3.
    List<String> groups = new ArrayList<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i += 3) {
        groups.add(s.substring(i, Math.min(i + 3, s.length())));
    }
    // reverse cycle elements in each group. Unless group has fewer elements than 3.
    for (int i = 0; i < groups.size(); i++) {
        if (groups.get(i).length() == 3) {
            groups.set(i, "" + groups.get(i).charAt(2) + groups.get(i).substring(0, 2));
        }
    }
    return String.join("", groups);
}

public static void main(String[] args){
    Solution sol = new Solution();
    String input = "Hello, World!";
    String encoded = sol.encodeCyclic(input);
    System.out.println(encoded);
    String decoded = sol.decodeCyclic(encoded);
    System.out.println(decoded);
}
}

The encodeCyclic function takes a string as input and returns a string where every group of 3 characters in the input string is cycled to the right by one character. If a group has fewer than 3 characters, it is left unchanged. The decodeCyclic function takes a string encoded with the encodeCyclic function and returns the original string. It does this by reversing the cycle operation.

I'm not sure about the error you're seeing, but it looks like you might be missing some characters in your output. Could you please provide more details about the error you're encountering?


A: You are getting an error because you are trying to access a character at an index that does not exist.
Here is the code snippet in question:
groups.set(i, groups.get(i).substring(1) + groups.get(i).charAt(0));

The substring(1) will return a string that is one character shorter, and charAt(0) will return the first character of the string. If the length of the string is 1, sub
