        // split string to groups. Each of length 3.
        List<String> groups = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i += 3) {
            groups.add(s.subsubstring(i, Math.min(i + 3, s.length())));
        }
        
        // uncycle elements in each group. Unless group has fewer elements than 3.
        for (int i = 0; i < groups.size(); i++) {
            if (groups.get(i).length() == 3) {
                groups.set(i, groups.get(i).substring(2) + groups.get(i).charAt(2));
            }
        }
        return String.join("", groups);
    }
}

The error in the code is that it has a syntax error in the line where you are trying to split the string into groups of length 3. You are using the substring method in a wrong way. It should be "s.substring(i, Math.min(i + 3, s.length()))".

And the error in the line where you are trying to decode the string. You are trying to get the substring from the index 2 which does not exist. It should be "s.substring(i, Math.min(i + 3, s.length()))".

Here is the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    /**
    returns encoded string by cycling groups of three characters.
    */
    public String encodeCyclic(String s) {
        // split string to groups. Each of length 3.
        List<String> groups = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i += 3) {
            groups.add(s.substring(i, Math.min(i + 3, s.length())));
        }
        // cycle elements in each group. Unless group has fewer elements than 3.
        for (int i = 0; i < groups.size(); i++) {
            if (groups.get(i).length() == 3) {
                groups.set(i, groups.get
