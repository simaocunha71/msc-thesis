        if (txt.contains(" ")) {
            return Arrays.asList(txt.split(" "));
        } else if (txt.contains(",")) {
            return Arrays.asList(txt.split(","));
        } else {
            int count = 0;
            for (char c : txt.toCharArray()) {
                if (Character.isLowerCase(c) && (c - 'a') % 2 == 1) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
            return count;
        }
    }
}

This solution first checks if the string contains whitespace, then checks for commas. If neither is found, it counts the number of lower-case characters with odd order in the alphabet and returns that count.

It's worth noting that this solution returns a List of Strings. In Java, it's generally better to use specific types when possible. For example, you might want to return a List<String> instead of Object.

Also, this solution doesn't handle other special characters or upper-case letters. If you need to handle those cases, you'll need to modify the solution.

A: Here is the corrected version of your code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    public Object splitWords(String txt) {
        if (txt.contains(" ")) {
            return Arrays.asList(txt.split(" "));
        } else if (txt.contains(",")) {
            return Arrays.asList(txt.split(","));
        } else {
            int count = 0;
            for (char c : txt.toCharArray()) {
                if (Character.isLowerCase(c) && (c - 'a') % 2 == 1) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
            return count;
        }
    }
}
```
This code now correctly identifies the number of lower-case letters with odd order in the alphabet. The characters are checked one by one, and if the character is a lowercase letter and its ASCII value is odd (i.e., (c - 'a') % 2 == 1), the count is incremented. This
