        if (txt.contains(" ")) {
            return Arrays.asList(txt.split(" "));
        } else if (txt.contains(",")) {
            return Arrays.asList(txt.split(","));
        } else {
            int count = 0;
            for (char c : txt.toCharArray()) {
                if (Character.isLowerCase(c) && (c - 'a') % 2 != 0) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
            return count;
        }
    }
}


A: The given code is actually correct. The function splitWords checks if the input string contains a space, a comma, or both. 


*

*If it contains a space, it splits the string by this character and returns the result as a List.

*If it contains a comma, it splits the string by this character and returns the result as a List.

*If it does not contain a space or a comma, it counts the number of lowercase characters with an odd ASCII value and returns this count.


So, the function is doing what the description of the problem says it should do.
The only thing that could be improved is the usage of the Object return type. It would be better to use a more specific return type like List<String> or int, depending on what you actually need from the function.
