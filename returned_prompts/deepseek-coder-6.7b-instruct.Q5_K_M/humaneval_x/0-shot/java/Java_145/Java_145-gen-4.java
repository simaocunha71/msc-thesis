A: You've got it. This solution sorts the list first based on the original index and then based on the sum of the digits. The sum of the digits is calculated using a helper function getSumOfDigits(). If the sum of the digits are equal, the original index is used to sort.

Here is a more detailed explanation:

1. If the list is empty, it returns the same empty list.

2. If the list is not empty, it creates a map where the key is the index of the number in the original list and the value is the sum of the digits of the number.

3. It then sorts the list based on the original index and then the sum of the digits. The sorted function Comparator.comparingByKey(map::get) sorts based on the original index, and Comparator.comparingInt(this::getSumOfDigits) sorts based on the sum of the digits.

4. Finally, it collects the sorted list into a new list and returns it.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) because of the sorting operation, where n is the length of the list. The space complexity is O(n) because of the extra space used to store the map.

This solution should work for your problem. If you have
