    return Arrays.asList(largestNegative, smallestPositive);

In this solution, we traverse the list and check if each number is negative or positive. If it's negative, we check if the current largestNegative is present, and if it's greater than the new number, we update the largestNegative. If it's not present, we set the new number as the largestNegative. If it's positive, we do the same with smallestPositive. At the end, we return a list containing the largestNegative and smallestPositive. If they're not present, they will be Optional.empty().

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the list. It traverses the list only once.

It also has a space complexity of O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the largestNegative and smallestPositive.

It's important to note that the method returns a List<Optional<Integer>>, which means it will return a list of Optional Integers. This is because the Optional class in Java is used to handle the null values and it's considered a good practice to avoid nulls in your code. In this case, it's used to handle the case where there are no negative or positive integers in the list, so we can return an empty Optional instead of null.

In addition, the Arrays.asList() method in the main method is used to convert the list of Integers into a List
