        List<Optional<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<Optional<Integer>>(Arrays.asList(Optional.empty(), Optional.empty()));
        int maxNegative = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int minPositive = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        boolean negativeExists = false;
        boolean positiveExists = false;

        for(Integer num: lst){
            if(num < 0 && num > maxNegative){
                maxNegative = num;
                negativeExists = true;
            }

            if(num > 0 && num < minPositive){
                minPositive = num;
                positiveExists = true;
            }
        }

        if(negativeExists){
            result.set(0, Optional.of(maxNegative));
        }

        if(positiveExists){
            result.set(1, Optional.of(minPositive));
        }

        return result;
    }
}

This code first creates a list with two optional integers and sets them to empty. Then it iterates through the given list. If it finds a negative integer that is greater than the current maxNegative, it sets the maxNegative to that number and sets the negativeExists to true. If it finds a positive integer that is less than the current minPositive, it sets the minPositive to that number and sets the positiveExists to true.

Finally, it sets the first element of the result list to the maxNegative if negativeExists is true, and sets the second element of the result list to the minPositive if positiveExists is true. It then returns the result list.

This way, the function will return a list with two optional integers where the first one is the largest negative integer and the second one is the smallest positive integer. If there are no negative or positive integers, it will return them as empty.

Please note that this code uses Java 8 or newer, as it uses Optional class which was introduced in Java 8.

This code should work for your provided examples. If there are any other edge cases you want to consider, please provide them.

I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.


A: The problem in your code is that you're trying to return a tuple (a, b) but the language you'
