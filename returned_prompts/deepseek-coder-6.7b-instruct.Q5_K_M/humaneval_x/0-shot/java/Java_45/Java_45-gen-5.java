        return 0.5 * a * h;

    }
}
```

The correct answer is:

```java
public double triangleArea(double a, double h)  {
        return 0.5 * a * h;
    }
```

This is a simple method that calculates the area of a triangle given the length of one side (a) and the height (h). The formula for the area of a triangle is 0.5 * base * height.
