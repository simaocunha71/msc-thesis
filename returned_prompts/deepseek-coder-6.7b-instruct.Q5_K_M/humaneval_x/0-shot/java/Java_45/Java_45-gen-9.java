        return (a * h) / 2;
    }
}

The solution is a simple one. The formula for the area of a triangle is (base * height) / 2. So, we return the result of this calculation.

The test case provided is wrong, but here's a correct one:

```java
import java.lang.*;

class Solution  {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution s = new Solution();
        System.out.println(s.triangleArea(5, 3));  // Should print 7.5
    }

    public double triangleArea(double a, double h) {
        return (a * h) / 2;
    }
}
```

This test case creates a Solution object and calls the triangleArea method with the inputs 5 and 3. The expected output is 7.5, which matches the result of the calculation.
