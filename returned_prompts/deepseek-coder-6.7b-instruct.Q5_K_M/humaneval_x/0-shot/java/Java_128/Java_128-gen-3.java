        if(arr.isEmpty()){
            return Optional.empty();
        }

        int productSign = 1;
        int sumMagnitude = 0;

        for(Integer num : arr){
            if(num < 0){
                productSign *= -1;
            }
            else if(num > 0){
                productSign *= 1;
            }
            else{
                return Optional.of(0);
            }

            sumMagnitude += Math.abs(num);
        }

        return Optional.of(productSign * sumMagnitude);
    }
}

Note: The problem statement is a little bit misleading, as it says to return product of all signs of each number, but this is not what is intended by the problem. It is supposed to be the product of all the signs of the numbers in the array, not the product of each number's sign. The sign of a number is represented by 1 for positive, -1 for negative and 0 for zero. So, for the given array [1, 2, 2, -4], the signs are [1, 1, 1, -1], so the product is -1, not 1. Then the sum of the magnitudes is 10. So, the final result should be -10, not -9.

Also, the function should return 0 if there's a zero in the array, as per the problem statement.

The problem statement seems to have a misunderstanding. I hope this clarification helps.

Also, the function should return None for an empty array, as per the problem statement.

Again, I hope this clarification helps.


The function is correct as per the problem statement. It calculates the product of the signs and the sum of the magnitudes, and returns the product of these two values. If the array is empty, it returns None. If there's a zero in the array, it returns 0.


This function will correctly calculate the sum of the absolute values of the numbers in the array, and then multiply this sum by the product of the signs of the numbers in the array. It will return this final value. If the array is empty, it will return None. If there's a zero in the array, it will return
