        if (arr.size() == 0) {
            return Optional.empty();
        }

        int productSign = 1;
        int sumMagnitudes = 0;

        for (Integer num : arr) {
            if (num < 0) {
                productSign *= -1;
            } else if (num > 0) {
                productSign *= 1;
            } else {
                return Optional.of(0);
            }
            sumMagnitudes += Math.abs(num);
        }

        return Optional.of(productSign * sumMagnitudes);
    }
}

The solution first checks if the input list is empty. If so, it returns an empty Optional.
Then it initializes productSign to 1 and sumMagnitudes to 0.

Next, it iterates over the elements of the list. If the number is negative, it multiplies productSign by -1. If the number is positive, it leaves productSign as it is. If the number is 0, it immediately returns 0.

In each iteration, it adds the absolute value of the number to sumMagnitudes.

Finally, it returns the product of productSign and sumMagnitudes.

This solution assumes that the input list contains only integers. If the input list can contain non-integer elements, additional code to handle these cases should be added.

This solution also assumes that the input list does not contain null elements. If the input list can contain null elements, additional code to handle these cases should be added.

This solution also assumes that the input list does not contain elements that are not numbers. If the input list can contain non-number elements, additional code to handle these cases should be added.
