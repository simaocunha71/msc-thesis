        if (arr.size() == 0) {
            return Optional.empty();
        }
        int productSign = 1;
        int sum = 0;
        for (int num : arr) {
            if (num < 0) {
                productSign *= -1;
            } else if (num > 0) {
                productSign *= 1;
            } else {
                return Optional.of(0);
            }
            sum += Math.abs(num);
        }
        return Optional.of(productSign * sum);
    }
}

The problem was that I misunderstood the question. I was trying to multiply each number's magnitude with the product of all the numbers' signs, but the problem wants us to multiply each number's magnitude with the sum of all the magnitudes, not the product of all the numbers' signs.

So, I changed the code to calculate the sum of magnitudes and then multiplied it with the product of the signs.

This is my corrected code:

```java
