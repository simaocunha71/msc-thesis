            if (string.length() > longest.length()){
                longest = string;

A: Your solution is correct. It iterates through the list of strings, comparing the length of each string to the length of the currently longest string. If the length of the current string is longer, it becomes the new longest string.

The usage of Optional<String> is correct as well. It returns an Optional object which can either contain a non-null value (present) or be empty (absent). This is a better approach than returning null since it avoids NullPointerExceptions.

The only thing you could consider doing is to add a null check on the input list before proceeding with the iteration. This would prevent an IndexOutOfBoundsException if the input list is null.

Here's the updated code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    public Optional<String> longest(List<String> strings) {
        if (strings == null || strings.isEmpty()){
            return Optional.empty();
        }

        String longest = strings.get(0);

        for (String string : strings) {
            if (string.length() > longest.length()){
                longest = string;
            }
        }

        return Optional.of(longest);
    }
}
```

This code ensures that the list is not null and not empty before proceeding with the iteration. If the list is empty or null, it returns an empty Optional object.

Remember, it is a good practice to handle potential null inputs in your code to prevent potential runtime errors.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the number of elements in the list. This is because it traverses the list once to find the longest string.

The space complexity is O(1) as it uses a constant amount of space to store the longest string.

This solution meets all the requirements as described in the question.
