A: 
Here is the corrected answer:

public int getMaxTriples(int n)  {
    int[] array = new int[n];
    int count = 0;

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        array[i - 1] = i * i - i + 1;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < n - 2; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n - 1; j++) {
            for (int k = j + 1; k < n; k++) {
                if ((array[i] + array[j] + array[k]) % 3 == 0) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return count;
}

Explanation:

The original code was almost correct, but the issue was that it was trying to access an array element at index i, j, and k that may be out of bounds. The array length is n, so the valid indices are 0 through n-1. 

So, I just changed the loop conditions to start from 0 and end at n-1, and everything works fine now.

In the first loop, I calculate the value of each element of the array based on the formula given in the problem statement. 

In the second and third nested loops, I generate all possible triples of the array elements and count the ones for which the
