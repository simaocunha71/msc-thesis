Here is my approach:
I created an array of size n+1 and filled it with the values as per the given formula. Then for every possible triplets of the array, I checked if their sum is a multiple of 3. If it is, I incremented the count. In the end, I returned the count.
The time complexity of this approach is O(n^3) and space complexity is O(n).

A: Your code is correct and it should work fine for all possible inputs of n. The code you posted is a brute-force solution, which means it checks all possible combinations of 3 numbers in the array. If the sum of these 3 numbers is a multiple of 3, it increments the count.

Your logic for calculating the values in the array is correct as well. The formula you provided is the correct one for calculating the values.

The time complexity of your code is O(n^3), which means that as n gets larger, the number of operations your code has to perform increases extremely quickly. This is because you're checking every possible triplet of numbers in your array.

The space complexity of your code is O(n), because you're storing n numbers in your array.

So, your code is efficient and should work correctly for all valid inputs of n.

However, there is a minor optimization you can do. Instead of checking all possible triplets of numbers in your array, you can check if the sum of any two numbers in your array is a multiple of 3. If it is, you can immediately know that the sum of the three numbers is a multiple of 3, without having to check
