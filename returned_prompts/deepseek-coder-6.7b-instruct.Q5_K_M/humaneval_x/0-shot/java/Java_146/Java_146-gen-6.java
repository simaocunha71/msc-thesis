A: 
The answer is correct, but I'm not sure why the question asks for the number of elements in the array that are greater than 10 and both the first and the last digits of the number are odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9). Could you clarify this?

It seems like the question is asking for the count of numbers where the absolute value is greater than 10 and both the first and last digits are odd. This is the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution  {

    public int specialFilter(List<Integer> nums) {
        int count = 0;
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(1, 3, 5, 7, 9));

        for (int num : nums) {
            if (Math.abs(num) > 10) {
                int firstDigit = Math.abs(num / 10);
                int lastDigit = Math.abs(num % 10);
                if (set.contains(firstDigit) && set.contains(lastDigit)) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```
The Math.abs() function is used to ensure that the program works with both positive and negative numbers.

If the question is asking for the count of numbers where the absolute value is greater than 10 and both the first and last digits are odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9
