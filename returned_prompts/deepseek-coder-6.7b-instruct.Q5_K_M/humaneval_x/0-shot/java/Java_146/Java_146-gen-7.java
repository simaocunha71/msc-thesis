Explanation:
In the specialFilter function, we are iterating over each number in the list and checking if it is greater than 10 and if the first and last digits of the number are odd. If these conditions are met, we increment the count.

In the isFirstAndLastOdd helper function, we are getting the last digit by taking the modulus of the number by 10. To get the first digit, we are dividing the number by 10 until it becomes 0, and then taking the modulus of the last number we got by 10. We then check if these digits are odd by taking the modulus of the number by 2. If the result is not 0, the number is odd.

Finally, we return the count.

// Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of elements in the list
// Space Complexity: O(1) since we are not using any extra space that scales with the input size.

// This code should work as expected and pass the tests.
// If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

// Happy Coding :)
