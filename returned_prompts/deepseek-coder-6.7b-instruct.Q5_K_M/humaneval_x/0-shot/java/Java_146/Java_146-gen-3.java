        int count = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num > 10) {
                int lastDigit = Math.abs(num % 10);
                int firstDigit = Math.abs(num / 10);
                if (isOdd(lastDigit) && isOdd(firstDigit)) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }

        return num % 2 != 0;
    }
}

In this solution, we first define a helper function isOdd to check whether a number is odd or not. Then, we iterate over each number in the input list. If the number is greater than 10 and its first and last digits are both odd, we increment our count. Finally, we return the count.
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the size of the input list. This is because we are iterating over the list once.
The space complexity is O(1), as we are using a constant amount of space to store our count and the input list.

A: It seems like the code you posted is correct. You're iterating over the list of numbers, and for each number, you're checking if it's greater than 10 and if its first and last digits are odd. If both conditions are met, you're incrementing the count. Finally, you're returning the count.

Here's the same code with a little bit of explanation:

```java
public int specialFilter(List<Integer> nums) {
    int count = 0; // Count of numbers that meet the conditions

    // Iterate over each number in the list
    for (int num : nums) {
        // Check if the number is greater than 10
        if (num > 10) {
            // Get the last digit of the number
            int lastDigit = Math.abs(num % 10);
            // Get the first digit of the number
            int firstDigit = Math.abs(num / 10);
            
            // Check if the last digit and the first digit are odd
