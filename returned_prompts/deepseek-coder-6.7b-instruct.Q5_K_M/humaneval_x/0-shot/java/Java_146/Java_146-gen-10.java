The function specialFilter takes an ArrayList of integers as input. It iterates through the list of numbers. For each number, it checks if the number is greater than 10. If it is, it takes the last digit of the number by finding the remainder when the number is divided by 10. It also takes the first digit of the number by integer division of the number by 10. If both the last and first digits are odd, it increments the count by 1. Finally, it returns the count.
