        int count = 0;
        for(int num : nums){
            if(num > 10 && isFirstAndLastOdd(num)){
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }

    private boolean isFirstAndLastOdd(int num){
        int firstDigit = num;
        while(firstDigit >= 10){
            firstDigit /= 10;
        }
        int lastDigit = num % 10;
        return (firstDigit % 2 != 0) && (lastDigit % 2 != 0);
    }
}

This solution works by iterating over the provided list and for each number, it checks if the number is greater than 10 and if the first and last digits of the number are both odd. If it is, it increments a counter. The function then returns the counter.

The helper function isFirstAndLastOdd gets the first and last digits of a number by dividing the number by 10 until there are no more digits left, then getting the remainder of the number when divided by 10. It checks if these digits are odd by using the modulus operator.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list, as it needs to go through each element once. The space complexity is O(1) as it only uses a single integer variable to count the elements that meet the criteria.

// Answer:
The provided Java solution correctly implements the problem statement. The function specialFilter iterates over the input list and increments a counter if the current number is greater than 10 and both its first and last digits are odd. The helper function isFirstAndLastOdd correctly determines if the first and last digits of a number are odd.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), as it goes through each element of the list once. The space complexity is O(1), as it only uses a single integer variable to count the elements that meet the criteria.

Therefore, the provided solution meets the problem requirements.

Note: This solution assumes that by "greater than 10" the question means "strictly greater than 10". If by "greater than 10" the
