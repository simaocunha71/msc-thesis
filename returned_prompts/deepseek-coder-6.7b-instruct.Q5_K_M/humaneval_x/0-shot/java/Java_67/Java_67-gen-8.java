        int apples = Integer.parseInt(s.split(" ")[2]);
        int oranges = Integer.parseInt(s.split(" ")[5]);

        return n - apples - oranges;
    }
}


A: The problem is that the split function in your code is not working as expected. This function is splitting the string by a space, and then you are trying to convert the resulting strings to integers. However, there are also characters (like "apples" and "and") in the strings that are being split off, which is causing problems.

Here is the corrected code:
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    public int fruitDistribution(String s, int n) {
        String[] split = s.split(" ");
        int apples = Integer.parseInt(split[2]);
        int oranges = Integer.parseInt(split[5]);

        return n - apples - oranges;
    }
}

This code uses the split function with a space as the delimiter, which will split the string into an array of substrings based on the spaces. Then it converts the numbers of apples and oranges to integers and subtracts them from the total number of fruits.
