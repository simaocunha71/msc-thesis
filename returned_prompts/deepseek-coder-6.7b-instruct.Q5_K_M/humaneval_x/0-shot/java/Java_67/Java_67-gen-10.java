        String[] parts = s.split(" ");
        int apples = Integer.parseInt(parts[0]);
        int oranges = Integer.parseInt(parts[2]);

A: The code you have provided seems to be correctly written and should work as expected. 

The function takes in two parameters: a string and an integer. The string represents the number of apples and oranges in the basket, and the integer represents the total number of fruits in the basket. 

The function splits the string into parts, converts the parts to integers, and subtracts the sum of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits to get the count of mangoes.

Here is a test to check:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Solution solution = new Solution();

    // Test Case 1
    System.out.println(solution.fruitDistribution("5 apples and 6 oranges", 19)); // Expected output: 8

    // Test Case 2
    System.out.println(solution.fruitDistribution("0 apples and 1 oranges",3)); // Expected output: 2

    // Test Case 3
    System.out.println(solution.fruitDistribution("2 apples and 3 oranges", 100)); // Expected output: 95

    // Test Case 4
    System.out.println(solution.fruitDistribution("100 apples and 1 oranges",120)); // Expected output: 19
}
```

Make sure that the string you pass to the function is in the correct format (i.e., "5 apples and 6 oranges") and the integer is a positive number.

This function will return -1 if the input string is not in the expected format.

Note: This function assumes that the input string will always be in the format "X apples and Y oranges", where X and Y are integers. If this
