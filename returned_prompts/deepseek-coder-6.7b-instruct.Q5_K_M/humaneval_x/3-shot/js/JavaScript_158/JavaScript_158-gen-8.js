  The solution to the given problem is written in JavaScript. The problem states to write a function that accepts a list of numbers and a threshold. The function checks if there are any two numbers in the list that are closer to each other than the given threshold. The function returns a boolean value (true if there are two numbers closer to each other than the threshold, false otherwise).

  The second problem is to separate groups of nested parentheses from a string and return them as a list. The function returns a list of strings where each string is a group of nested parentheses.

  The third problem is to return the decimal part of a given number. The function returns the decimal part of the given number.

  The fourth problem is to find the word with the maximum number of unique characters in a given list of words. If there are multiple words with the same number of unique characters, the function returns the word that comes first in lexicographical order.

  For all these problems, I have used basic programming concepts and structures of JavaScript.

  The time complexity of the solution for the first problem is O(n^2) where n is the length of the numbers list. The space complexity is O(1) because no extra space is used.

  The time complexity of the solution for the second problem is O(n) where n is the length of the parentheses string. The space complexity is O(n) because we are storing the result in a list.

  The time complexity of the solution for the third problem is O(1). The space complexity is O(1).

  The time complexity of the solution for the fourth problem is O(n*m) where n is the number of words and m is the length of the longest word. The space complexity is O(1) because no extra space is used.
