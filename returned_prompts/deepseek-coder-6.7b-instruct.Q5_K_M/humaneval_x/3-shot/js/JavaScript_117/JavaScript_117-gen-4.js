  const vowels = new Set(["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]);
  return s.split(" ").filter(word => {
    let count = 0;

      if (!vowels.has(letter.toLowerCase())) count++;

    return count === n;
  });
}


A: You're almost there with your solution, but there's a small issue with the vowel check. You need to check if the letter is not in the vowels set.

Here's the corrected code:

const selectWords = (s, n) => {
  const vowels = new Set(["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]);
  return s.split(" ").filter(word => {
    let count = 0;
    for (let letter of word) {
      if (!vowels.has(letter.toLowerCase())) count++;
    }
    return count === n;
  });
}

In your original code, you were checking if the letter was in the vowels set, which would count vowels as consonants. The corrected code checks if the letter is not in the vowels set, which is what you want to count as consonants.

In addition, you've used a set to store the vowels, which can improve the performance of the function if the input string is very large.

Finally, you've used the filter method to create a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. In this case, the test is whether the number of consonants in the word is equal to n. If it is, the word is included in the new array.

This should give you the desired output.

Here's how you can use the function:

console.log(selectWords("Mary had a little lamb", 4)); // Output: [ 'little' ]
console.log(selectWords("Mary had a little lamb", 3)); // Output: [ 'Mary' ]
console.log(selectWords("simple white space", 2)); // Output: []
console.log(selectWords("Hello world", 4)); // Output: [
