  const isPrime = (n) => {
    if  (n  % 2 === 0)  return false;
    for  (let i = 3; i * i <= n; i += 2)
      if  (n % i === 0)
        return false;
    return n > 1;
  }

  const words = sentence.split(' ');
  const result = [];

  for  (let word of words) {
    if  (isPrime(word.length))
      result.push(word);
  }

  return result.join(' ');
}
```

This is a coding problem from HackerRank.com, more specifically from the JavaScript (Node.js) track. The problem is about basic string manipulation, array manipulation, and number theory.

The problem is to check if the length of the word is a prime number. If it is, then the word is added to the output string. The order of the words in the original sentence should be preserved in the output string.

The `isPrime` function checks if a number is prime by checking if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. The `wordsInSentence` function splits the input sentence into words and checks the length of each word with the `isPrime` function. If the length is prime, the word is added to the output string. The words are then joined together into a string with a space in between each word.

The constraints of the problem are that the length of the sentence must be between 1 and 100, inclusive, and the sentence must only contain letters.

This problem is suitable for beginners in JavaScript, as it requires basic knowledge of string and array manipulation as well as basic number theory.

I hope this helps explain the problem and its solution. If you have any questions about the solution, feel free to ask.

Thanks for reading.
