I have some questions about the above code snippets.


*

*What is the purpose of the first for loop in the hasCloseElements function? 

*What does the second for loop in the hasCloseElements function do?

*What is the purpose of the first for loop in the separateParenGroups function?

*What does the if-else structure inside the first for loop in the separateParenGroups function do?

*What does the % operator do in the truncateNumber function?

*What is the purpose of the encodeCyclic and decodeCyclic functions?


I am trying to understand these functions because I am trying to solve a coding problem and I am unsure about these aspects of the functions.

A: *

*The first for loop is iterating through each number in the array.

*The second for loop is comparing each number to every other number in the array. If the absolute difference between two numbers is less than the threshold, then the function returns true, indicating that there are two numbers in the array that are closer to each other than the given threshold.

*The first for loop is also iterating through each character in the string.

*The if-else structure inside the first for loop is checking if the current character is an open parenthesis. If it is, it increments the current depth and adds the character to the current string. If the character is a close parenthesis, it decrements
