  The code you provided is already correct. It takes as input a list of lists (or matrix) and a number, and returns a list of tuples. Each tuple represents a coordinate in the matrix where the number is found.

  The sorting part is important. First, it sorts the coordinates by rows in ascending order. If the rows are equal, it then sorts the coordinates by columns in descending order. This ensures that the coordinates are sorted first by row, then by column.

  In the provided examples, it correctly finds the coordinates of the number 1 in the matrix, and also correctly handles cases where the matrix is empty or the number is not found.

  The time complexity of this solution is O(n*m), where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns in the matrix. This is because in the worst case, it needs to traverse every element in the matrix once.

  The space complexity is also O(n*m), as in the worst case, all elements in the matrix can be stored in the result list.

  Therefore, this solution is efficient for both time and space.

  You can test the function with the provided examples, and it should return the expected output.

  Here is the function you provided:

  ```python
  def getRow(lst, x):
      result = []
      for  i in range(len(lst)):
          for  j in range(len(lst[i])):
              if  lst[i][j] == x:
                  result.append((i, j))
