The answers provided are correct. This task is about manipulating strings and understanding how to work with different data types in JavaScript. The given tasks involve string concatenation, array manipulation and basic arithmetic operations.

In the first task, the goal is to find two numbers in a given array that are closer to each other than a given threshold. This can be achieved by iterating over the array and comparing the absolute difference between every pair of numbers. If the difference is less than the threshold, the function returns true. If no such pair is found after checking all pairs, the function returns false.

In the second task, the goal is to separate groups of balanced parentheses from a string. This can be achieved by iterating over the string and keeping track of the depth of parentheses. Whenever a parenthesis is closed, a group is found and can be added to the result.

In the third task, the goal is to get the decimal part of a number. This can be achieved by using the modulus operator, which gives the remainder of a division operation.

In the fourth task, the goal is to check
