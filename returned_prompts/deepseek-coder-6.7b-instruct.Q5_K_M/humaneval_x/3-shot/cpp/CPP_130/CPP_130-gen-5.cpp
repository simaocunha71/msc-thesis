In the first problem, you are given a vector of float numbers and a threshold. You need to check if there are two numbers in the vector that are closer than the given threshold. The function abs(x) gives the absolute value of x, which is the distance between two numbers.

In the second problem, you are given a string containing nested parentheses and you need to separate all the groups of balanced parentheses.

In the third problem, you are given a float number and you need to return the decimal part of it.

In the fourth problem, you are given a non-negative integer n and you need to return a vector of the first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence. The Tribonacci sequence is a generalization of the Fibonacci sequence where every term after the first two is the sum of the previous three terms.

I hope this explanation helps you understand the problems better. Let me know if you have any more questions.
