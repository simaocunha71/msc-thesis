The answer for Q1 and Q2 is given in the problem statement. The answer for Q3 is given in the problem statement. The answer for Q4 is given in the problem statement.

Q1:
In the first question, you are given an array of numbers and a threshold. The function has_close_elements takes this array and threshold as parameters. It traverses the array and checks if any two numbers are closer to each other than the given threshold. If it finds such a pair, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

Q2:
In the second question, you are given a string of parentheses. The function separate_paren_groups takes this string as a parameter. It separates the balanced parentheses groups from the string and returns them in a vector.

Q3:
In the third question, you are given a floating point number. The function truncate_number takes this number as a parameter. It returns the decimal part of the number.

Q4:
In the fourth question, you are given two intervals. The function intersection takes these two intervals as parameters. It checks if the length of the intersection of the two intervals is a prime number. If it is, it returns "YES". Otherwise, it returns "NO".
