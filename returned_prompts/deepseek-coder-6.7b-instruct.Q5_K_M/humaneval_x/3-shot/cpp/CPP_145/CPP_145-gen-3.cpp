In the above programs, it seems that you have not included any error handling or exception handling. For instance, if the input vector is empty in function 'has_close_elements', the program will crash. You should handle these edge cases.

Also, it is important to note that the C++ standard library does not have a function 'abs' for integers. You should use the 'abs' function from the 'cmath' library for integers.

Moreover, the C++ standard library does not have a function 'sort' for vectors. You should use the 'sort' function from the 'algorithm' library.

In your main function, you should not use 'return 0' at the end. The main function should return an integer.

In the function 'separate_paren_groups', you should not use 'return' after the 'if' statement. The function should return the vector 'all_parens' at the end.

In the function 'truncate_number', you should not use 'return' at the end. The function should return the float 'number - int(number)'.

In the function 'order_by_points', you should not use 'return' at the end. The function should return the vector 'result'.

So, the corrected codes are as follows:

```C++
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
#include<math.h>
#include<algorithm>
using namespace std;

bool has_close_elements(vector<float> numbers, float threshold){
