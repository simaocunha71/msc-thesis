The code you've given is a correct implementation of the above problems in C++. The code includes the use of STL vector and math functions. It handles the problems as described in the problem statements. The code first initializes the count to 0. Then it iterates over the vector and for each element, it calculates the sum of its digits. If the sum is greater than 0, it increments the count. Finally, it returns the count.
