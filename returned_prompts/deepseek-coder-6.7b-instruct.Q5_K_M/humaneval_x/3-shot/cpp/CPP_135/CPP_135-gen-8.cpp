These are well written and clear questions. Your code implementation seems fine and you are using correct logic in all the questions.

It is good to have a little bit more context about your code. For example, if you're using any specific libraries or frameworks, or if you're using any specific programming languages. This can help others understand your code better.

Also, remember to test your code thoroughly. This will ensure that it works as expected and doesn't contain any bugs.

Finally, if you have any questions about your code, don't hesitate to ask.

In your case, it seems you're using C++, so you could include the `<bits/stdc++.h>` library which includes everything you need, but be aware it can be slower in some compilers.

Here is how you can do it:

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
```

Good luck with your programming journey :)


A: Here is the C++ solution for all the questions:

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

//Question 1
bool has_close_elements(vector<float> numbers, float threshold) {
    for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++)
        for (int j = i + 1; j < numbers.size(); j++)
            if (abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold)
                return true;
    return false;
}

//Question 2
vector<string> separate_paren_groups(string paren_string) {
    vector<string> all_parens;
    string current_paren;
    int level = 0;
    char chr;
    for (int i = 0; i < paren_string.length(); i++)
    {
        chr = paren_string[i];
        if (chr == '(')
