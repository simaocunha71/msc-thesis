In the given problem,

- The first problem is asking to find if any two numbers in the given list are closer than a given threshold. This is solved by using a nested loop to iterate over each number and comparing it with every other number. If the difference between any two numbers is less than the threshold, return true. If no such pair is found after checking all pairs, return false.

- The second problem is asking to separate groups of balanced parentheses from a string. This is solved by using a simple loop to iterate over the string. If an open parenthesis is encountered, it is added to the current group. If a closed parenthesis is encountered, it is added to the current group and the group is added to the list of groups.

- The third problem is asking to truncate a floating point number to get the decimal part. This is solved by subtracting the integer part of the number from the number.

- The fourth problem is asking to check if the three sides of a triangle form a right-angled triangle. This is solved by first sorting the sides in descending order. Then, using the Pythagorean theorem, if the square of the largest side is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides, the triangle is right-angled.
