A: 
I am having trouble understanding how to use these templates, and I don't know how to properly use them.

It seems like you're asking for help with understanding and using templates. Here are some tips:

1. Understand the concept: A template is a way to write code that can work with different data types. It allows you to write a single function or class that can work with many different types.

2. Read the documentation: The documentation for each function or class you're trying to use should explain what templates are and how to use them.

3. Understand the syntax: When you see a template, you should understand that it's a way to make a function or class work with many different types. You'll see something like `template <typename T>`. T is a placeholder for any type.

4. Use the template: Once you understand the concept and syntax, you can start using templates. You'll see examples like `vector<int>` or `vector<float>`. This tells the compiler to create a vector that can store ints or floats. You can replace T with any valid type.

5. Experiment: Try to use templates with different types. You can use standard types like `int`, `float`, `string`, or you can define your own struct or class.

6. Debug: If you're having trouble, try to understand the error message. It usually tells you what's wrong and where. If you can't understand it, ask for help.
