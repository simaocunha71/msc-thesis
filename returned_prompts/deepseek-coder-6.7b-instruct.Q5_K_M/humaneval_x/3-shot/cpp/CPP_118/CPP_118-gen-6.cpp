In each of the above C++ solutions, you have to include the necessary libraries at the beginning of the code. The libraries stdio.h and string are included for standard input/output and string manipulation, respectively. The library vector is used for handling dynamic arrays, and the library math.h is for mathematical operations like abs.

The function has_close_elements checks if there are two numbers in the given vector that are closer to each other than the given threshold. This is achieved by iterating through the vector and for each number, checking if there is another number closer to it than the given threshold.

The function separate_paren_groups separates balanced groups of parentheses from a given string. It does this by iterating through the string and keeping track of the current group of parentheses in a variable. When a group is closed (i.e., when the level of parentheses is 0), it adds the current group to the vector of all groups and resets the current group.

The function truncate_number returns the decimal part of a given number. It does this by subtracting the integer part of the number from the number itself.

The function get_closest_vowel finds the closest vowel that stands between two consonants from the right side of the word. It does this by iterating through the word in reverse and checking each character to see if it is a vowel and whether the characters on its left and right are consonants. If it finds such a character, it returns it. If it doesn't find any, it returns an empty string.

The functions are written in a way that they return the correct output for the given examples.
