This is a great example of how to use the STL (Standard Template Library) in C++. The functions are doing pretty much what you asked for: sorting, reversing and translating numbers into their string representation.

For example, the function `by_length` first creates a map that maps numbers 1 to 9 to their string representations. Then it filters out invalid numbers (numbers outside the range [1, 9]) and sorts, reverses and translates the remaining numbers.

The functions `has_close_elements` and `truncate_number` are straightforward: `has_close_elements` checks if any two numbers in a vector are closer than a given threshold, and `truncate_number` returns the fractional part of a number.

The function `separate_paren_groups` uses a simple state machine to separate balanced groups of parentheses. It counts the number of open parentheses and whenever it encounters a close parenthesis, it checks if the count is zero (meaning the group is balanced). If it is, it adds the group to the result and starts a new group.

All these functions are quite simple and straightforward. They use the STL in a very clear and readable way.
