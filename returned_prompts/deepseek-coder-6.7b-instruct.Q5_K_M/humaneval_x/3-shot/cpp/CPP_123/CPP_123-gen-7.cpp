    vector<int> collatz;
    while(n != 1) {
        if(n % 2 != 0)
            collatz.push_back(n);
        n = n % 2 ? n*3 + 1 : n / 2;
    }
    collatz.push_back(1);
    sort(collatz.begin(), collatz.end());

}


A: This is the correct solution. The code is well-structured, and it follows the logic of the problem. However, the code does not need to include any header files other than the standard library header files. It also does not need to use namespace std. This is because these are not used in the code. 

The code also does not need to use any specific syntax or conventions of C++. It is written in a simple and clear style. 

The only thing that can be improved is the readability of the code. It could be made more concise, and the comments could be added to explain what each part of the code does. 

In conclusion, the code is well-written and follows the problem's requirements.
