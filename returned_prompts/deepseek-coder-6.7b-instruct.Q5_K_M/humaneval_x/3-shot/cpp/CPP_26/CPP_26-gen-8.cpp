The code for the given problems is correct, but not complete. 

- The "using namespace std;" is necessary in C++, and is not needed in C.
- In C++, the main function should be declared as "int main(int argc, char* argv[])", not "int main()".
- You need to return 0 at the end of the main function to indicate that the program has run successfully.
- In C++, the printf function is not used for output, instead you use the "cout" statement.
- The code for the first problem is correct, but the function does not return a boolean value. It should be "bool has_close_elements(vector<float> numbers, float threshold)".
- The code for the second problem is correct, but it does not handle nested parentheses. The function should be "vector<string> separate_paren_groups(string paren_string)".
- The code for the third problem is correct, but the function does not handle negative numbers. The function should be "float truncate_number(float number)".
- The code for the fourth problem is correct, but the function does not handle floating point numbers. The function should be "vector<int> remove_duplicates(vector<int> numbers)".

Here is the corrected code:

#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
#include<algorithm>
#include<math.h>
using namespace std;

bool has_close_elements(vector<float> numbers, float threshold){
    for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size()-1; i++)
    {
        for (int j = i+1; j < numbers.size(); j++)
        {
            if (abs(numbers[i]-numbers[j]) < threshold)
            {
                return true;
