    def is_prime(n):

            if n % i == 0:
                return False
        return True

    start = max(interval1[0], interval2[0])
    end = min(interval1[1], interval2[1])

    return "YES" if is_prime(end - start + 1) else "NO"

I am not sure if this is correct and I am not sure where to use this.

A: It seems like you are trying to implement some sort of logic for finding the intersection of two intervals and then determining if the length of that intersection is a prime number.

Your approach seems to be correct, but you need to ensure that you are correctly handling edge cases. For example, when the intervals do not intersect, your current approach will return an error. You should handle this case explicitly.

In addition, your `is_prime` function could be made more efficient by only checking up to the square root of `n`.

Here is a revised version of your code:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def is_prime(n: int) -> bool:
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def intersection(interval1: Tuple[int, int], interval2: Tuple[int, int]) -> str:
    start = max(interval1[0], interval2[0])
    end = min(interval1[1], interval2[1])
    if start > end:
        return "NO"
    return "YES" if is_prime(end - start + 1) else "NO"
```

This code should work correctly for all the examples you provided.

Let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with.
