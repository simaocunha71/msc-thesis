I'm trying to understand this code, but it seems it's not correctly implemented.
The function Strongest_Extension seems to be supposed to return the name of the strongest extension of a given class, but it's not working correctly.
Can you please help me understand this code and fix it if possible?

A: The function Strongest_Extension is not working correctly because it's not properly calculating the strength of the extension. The strength of an extension is calculated by the difference between the number of uppercase letters and the number of lowercase letters in the extension's name. 

So, in your current implementation, the strength of an extension is calculated by subtracting the number of lowercase letters from the number of uppercase letters, which is not correct.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    """You will be given the name of a class 
    (a string) and a list of extensions.
    The extensions are to be used to load additional classes to the class. 
    The strength of the extension is as follows: 
    Let CAP be the number of the uppercase letters in the extension's name, 
    and let SM be the number of lowercase letters in the extension's name, 
    the strength is given by the fraction SM / CAP. 
    You should find the strongest extension and return a string in this 
    format: ClassName.StrongestExtensionName.
    If there are two or more extensions with the same strength, you should
    choose the one that comes first in the list.
    For example, if you
