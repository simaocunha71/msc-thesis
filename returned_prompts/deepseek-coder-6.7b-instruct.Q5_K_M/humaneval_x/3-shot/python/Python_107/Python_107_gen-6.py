I have a problem with the even_odd_palindrome function. The function is supposed to count the number of even and odd palindromes in the range from 1 to n. However, it seems to be not functioning properly. I believe there is a problem with the way the function is calculating the number of palindromes. Can you help me understand where the problem lies?

A: The problem is in the way you are calculating the number of palindromes. You are checking if the integer representation of a number is a palindrome. But this is incorrect.

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

So, you need to convert the integer to a string, then check if that string is a palindrome. 

Also, to find the count of even and odd palindromes, you need to check if the last digit of the number is even or odd.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def even_odd_palindrome(n):
    def is_palindrome(s):
        return s == s[::-1]

    even_count = sum(is_palindrome(str(i)) and i % 2 == 0 for i in range(1, n+1))
    odd_count = sum(is_palindrome(str(i)) and i % 2 != 0 for i in range(1, n+1))

    return even_count, odd_count
```

This function works by iterating through the range from 1 to n (inclusive), converting each integer to a string, and checking if it's a palindrome. It also checks if the last digit of the number is even or odd. If it is a palindrome and the last digit is even,
