This code is written in Python. The first problem is to find out if there are two numbers in a given list that are closer to each other than a given threshold. It is solved by iterating over all pairs of numbers in the list and checking if the absolute difference is less than the threshold. If such pair is found, the function returns True.

The second problem is to separate nested parentheses groups from a string. It is solved by keeping track of the depth of parentheses in the string. When the depth becomes zero, we know that we have found a group.

The third problem is to return the decimal part of a number. This is solved by using the modulus operator.

The fourth problem is to find the n-th prime Fibonacci number. This is solved by generating Fibonacci numbers and checking if they are prime. We stop when we have found n such numbers.

There are some helper functions used here:
- is_prime checks if a number is prime.
- fib generates Fibonacci numbers.
