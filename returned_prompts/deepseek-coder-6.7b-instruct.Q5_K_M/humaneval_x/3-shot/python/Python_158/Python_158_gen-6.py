I am trying to solve these questions by myself.

A: You are almost there. But you have a small error in your code. You should use 'elem != idx2' instead of 'idx != idx2'. Also, you should not include the element itself while checking for the distance. So the correct code is as follows:

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
    False
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
    True
    """
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True
    return False
```

This function works by iterating over each pair of elements in the list. It computes the absolute difference between each pair of elements, and checks if this difference is less than the threshold. If it is, the function returns True. If no such pair is found after checking all pairs, the function returns False.

I hope this helps you understand the problem better. Let me know if you have any other questions.
