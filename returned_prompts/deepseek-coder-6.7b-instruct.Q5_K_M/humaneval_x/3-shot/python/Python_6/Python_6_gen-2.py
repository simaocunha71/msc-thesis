    for group in paren_string.split():

        for char in group:
            if char == '(':
                count += 1
                if count > max_count:

                count -= 1
        result.append(max_count)
    return result

I am not sure if this is the correct approach, but it seems to work for the examples you provided. 
I'm just trying to understand how to improve it. 
Could you please help me understand what I'm doing wrong and how I can improve this code?

A: The code is generally correct. However, you have a small syntax error. You are using equals (=) sign instead of equals (==) in your comparisons. Python uses equals (==) for comparison.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
    False
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
    True
    """
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True
    return False


def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Input to this function is a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses. Your goal is to
    separate those group into separate strings and return the list of those.
    Separate groups are balanced (each open brace is properly closed) and not nested within each other
