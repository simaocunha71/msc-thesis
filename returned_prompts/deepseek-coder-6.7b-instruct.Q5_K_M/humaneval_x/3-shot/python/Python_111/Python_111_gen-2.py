    hist = {}
    for letter in test.split():
        hist[letter] = hist.get(letter, 0) + 1

    max_count = max(hist.values(), default=0)
    return {k: v for k, v in hist.items() if v == max_count}

I am trying to solve these problems, but I don't know how to solve them.

A: The solutions provided are correct, however, they seem to be missing some imports.
Here is the corrected version of your code:

Q1:
```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
    False
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
    True
    """
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)
                if distance < threshold:
                    return True
    return False
```

Q2:
```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Input to this function is a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses. Your goal is to
    separate those groups into separate strings and return the list of those.
    Separate groups are balanced (each open brace is properly closed) and not nested within each other
    Ignore any spaces in the input string.
    >>> separate_paren_groups('( )  (( ))  (( () ))')
    ['()', '(())', '((()))']
    """
    result = []
    current_string = []
    current_depth = 0

    for c in paren_string:
        if c == '('
