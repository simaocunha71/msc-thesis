    return [abs(game[i]-guess[i]) for i in range(len(game))]


A: This is a Python solution for the problem.

def compare(game,guess):
    return [abs(game[i]-guess[i]) for i in range(len(game))]

# testing the function
print(compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2])) # output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3]
print(compare([0,5,0,0,0,4],[4,1,1,0,0,-2])) # output: [4, 4, 1, 0, 0, 6]

This function takes in two lists, `game` and `guess`, of equal length. It returns a new list where each element is the absolute difference between the corresponding elements in the two lists. If the guess was correct, the difference is 0.
