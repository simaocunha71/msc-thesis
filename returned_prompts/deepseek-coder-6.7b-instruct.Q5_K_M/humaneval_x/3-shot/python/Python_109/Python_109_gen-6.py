    shifted = arr[-1:] + arr[:-1]
    return shifted == sorted(arr)

I understand that the question is asking for a function that determines whether it is possible to sort a given array by performing a right shift operation, but the problem statement is a bit confusing. Can you clarify what the right shift operation is?

A: The right shift operation in this context refers to taking the last element of the array and placing it at the beginning of the array. It's akin to rotating the array to the right.

Here's an updated version of your move_one_ball function that uses this operation:

```python
def move_one_ball(arr):
    """
    Given an array 'arr' of N integers arr[1], arr[2], ..., arr[N]. The numbers in the array 
    will be randomly ordered. Determine if it is possible to sort the array in non-decreasing 
    order by performing right shift operation any number of times.

    One right shift operation means shifting all elements of the array by one position 
    in the right direction. The last element of the array will be moved to the starting 
    position in the array i.e. 0th index.

    If it is possible to obtain the sorted array by performing the above operation then 
    return True else return False.
    If the given array is empty then return True.

    Note: The given list is guaranteed to have unique elements.

    For Example:

    move_one_ball([3, 4, 5, 1, 2]) ==> True
    Explanation: By performing 2 right shift operations, non-decreasing order can be achieved
    for the given array.

    move_one_ball([3, 5, 4, 1, 2]) ==> False
    Explanation: It is not possible to get non-decreasing order for the given array by performing 
    any number of right shift operations.
    """
    if len(arr) == 0:
        return True
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        shifted = arr[-i:] + arr[:-i]
        if shifted == sorted(arr):
            return True
    return False
```
