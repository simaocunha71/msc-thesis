I am trying to implement this solution in Python, but I am having trouble understanding some aspects of it.
The solution seems to be using dynamic programming, but I'm having trouble understanding the purpose of the variables dp and dp2, and how they're being used.
I'm also not sure what the purpose of the get function is.
Could someone explain these concepts to me?

A: 
dp and dp2 are 2D lists (or arrays) in Python that store the intermediate results of the dynamic programming approach. dp and dp2 are initialized with 0s. The length of dp and dp2 is (N * N + 1) because we are considering paths of length from 0 to N * N.

The dynamic programming approach is used to keep track of
