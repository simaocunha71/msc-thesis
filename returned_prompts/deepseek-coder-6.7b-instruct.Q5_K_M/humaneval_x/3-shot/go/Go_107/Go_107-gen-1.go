I am new to Go and I am trying to implement these functions in Go. How can I improve the code? Any suggestions or improvements are welcome.

A: Here are some suggestions:

1. Use `range` instead of indexing: You can use the `range` keyword in Go to iterate over the elements of an array or slice. This is more idiomatic and easier to read than using an index.

2. Error handling: You should consider adding error handling to your function. For example, you might want to check if the input is within the valid range.

3. Avoid using magic numbers: Instead of using hard-coded numbers like 0.5 or 1, you could define them as constants at the top of your file. This makes your code easier to read and maintain.

4. Use `fmt.Sprintf` for string formatting: Instead of using `+` to concatenate strings, consider using `fmt.Sprintf`. This can make your code more readable and less error-prone.

5. Use `strconv.Atoi` for converting between strings and integers: You're already using `strconv.Itoa`, but you might want to consider using `strconv.Atoi` for the reverse operation.

6. Use `math.Abs` for absolute values: You've already used this in your code, but it's worth mentioning.

Here's an example of how you might improve your code:

```go
const (
    threshold = 0.5
    maxInt    = 1
