    sortedArr := make([]int, len(arr))
    copy(sortedArr, arr)
    sort.Ints(sortedArr)

    for i := range arr {
        if isNonDecreasing(arr, i) {
            return true
        }
    }
    return false
}

func isNonDecreasing(arr []int, shift int) bool {
    for i := range arr {
        j := (i + shift) % len(arr)
        if arr[j] < arr[(j-1+len(arr))%len(arr)] {
            return false
        }
    }
    return true
}

I am trying to understand the logic and the use of the different programming constructs used in each of the three problems.


*

*How does the function HasCloseElements determine if any two numbers in a list are closer than a given threshold? It seems like it is comparing every pair of numbers, but it doesn't seem to be checking all pairs.

*In the function SeparateParenGroups, why does it return a list of strings containing only parentheses? Is there a specific reason for this?

*In the function TruncateNumber, why does it return the decimal part of the number?

*In the function MoveOneBall, why does it return true if it is possible to sort an array in non-decreasing order by performing a right shift operation on it?


A: Let me address your queries one by one.


*

*The function HasCloseElements is comparing every pair of numbers in the list to see if the absolute difference between them is less than the given threshold. The reason it doesn't check all pairs is because it's only interested in pairs of distinct indices. It doesn't care if the same number is compared with itself.

*In the function SeparateParenGroups, it's grouping balanced parentheses. The reason it returns a list of strings containing only parentheses is because the input string is guaranteed to only contain parentheses. It splits the string into separate groups of balanced parentheses by tracking the depth of parentheses (represented by '(' being one depth level higher than ')'). When it finds a group
