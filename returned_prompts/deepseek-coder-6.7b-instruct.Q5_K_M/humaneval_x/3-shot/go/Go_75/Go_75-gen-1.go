I have some questions about these solutions:


*

*In the first function, why do we start the inner loop from i + 1 and not from 0?

*In the second function, I can see that the "current_depth" variable is used to determine when a group of parentheses has been completely closed. However, the "current_string" variable is updated regardless of the "current_depth". So, how does this work?

*In the third function, why is the math.Mod() function used to get the decimal part of a number?

*In the fourth function, the function "primeCheck" is used to check if a number is a prime number. Why is it necessary to check both i and a/i?


A: *

*In the first function, we start from i+1 because we don't want to compare an element with itself. If we start from 0, we would be comparing the same element with itself.

*In the second function, the "current_depth" variable is used to determine when a group of parentheses has been completely closed. This is because we increment the depth whenever we see an open parenthesis '(', and decrement the depth whenever we see a closed parenthesis ')'. When the depth reaches zero, it means that all parentheses in the current group have been closed. The "current_string" variable is updated with all characters in the current group, which we append to the result when the depth reaches zero.

*In the third function, the math.Mod() function is used to get the decimal part of a number
