    result := make([]string, len(lst))
    for i, s := range lst {
        count := 0
        for _, c := range s {
            if (c - '0') % 2 != 0 {
                count++
            }
        }
        result[i] = fmt.Sprintf("the number of odd elements %dn the str%dng %d of the %dnput.", count, count, i, i)
    }
    return result
}

I am trying to understand the code provided. However, I'm having a hard time following it. 
Could someone please explain each line of code in detail?

A: Here is the explanation of each line of code:

import (
    "fmt"
    "math"
)

// Importing the necessary packages.
