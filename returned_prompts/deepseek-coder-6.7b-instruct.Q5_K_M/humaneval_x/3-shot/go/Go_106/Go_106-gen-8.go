func factorial(n int) int {
    if n <= 1 {
        return 1
    }
    return n * factorial(n-1)
}

    sum := 0

        sum += i

In the function F, I first make a slice of integers of size n. I then loop through the slice and if the index i is even, I calculate the factorial of i and store it in the slice at index i. If the index i is odd, I calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to i and store it in the slice at index i.

The function factorial calculates the factorial of a number by recursively multiplying the number by the factorial of the number minus 1 until the number is 1 or less.

The function sum calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to a number by looping from 1 to the number and adding each number to a sum.

Finally, I return the slice.

The function F works for any positive integer n.

The function F has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n).
