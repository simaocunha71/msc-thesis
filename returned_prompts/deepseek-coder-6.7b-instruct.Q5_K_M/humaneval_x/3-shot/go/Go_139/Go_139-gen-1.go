    result := 1
    for i := n; i > 0; i-- {
        result *= Factorial(i)
    }
    return result
}

func Factorial(n int) int {
    if n == 0 {
        return 1
    }
    return n * Factorial(n-1)
}

I've been given these questions and I've been asked to solve them. 
I have a basic understanding of programming in Go, but I'm struggling with these questions. Could someone please explain to me how to approach these problems?

A: This seems like a good exercise for understanding recursion and iteration in Go.

*To solve HasCloseElements:


You need to iterate over the list and check the distance between each pair of numbers. If the distance is less than the threshold, return true. If you've checked all pairs without finding a close pair, return false.


*To solve SeparateParenGroups:


You need to iterate over the string, keeping track of the current depth. When you encounter an open parenthesis, increment the depth and add it to the current string. When you encounter a close parenthesis, decrement the depth and add it to the current string. When the depth is zero (indicating that you have found a balanced group), add the current string to the result and start a new current string.


*To solve TruncateNumber:


You can use the math.Mod function to get the decimal part of a number.


*To solve SpecialFactorial:


You need to implement a function to calculate the factorial of a number (you can use the Factorial function you already have), and then use a loop to multiply the factorial of n to the factorial of (n-1) to (n-i) for i from 1 to n.
I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any more questions.

A: Here's how you would approach these problems:


*

*To solve HasCloseElements:


You would iterate over each pair of elements in the list. For each pair, calculate the absolute difference between the two numbers, and check if this difference is less than the threshold. If so, return true. After checking all
