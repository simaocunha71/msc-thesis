    int sum = 0;
    for(int i=1; i<lst.size(); i+=2){
        if(lst[i]%2 == 0){
            sum += lst[i];
        }
    }
    return sum;
}

int main(){
    vector<int> lst = {4, 2, 6, 7};
    printf("%d\n", add(lst));
    return 0;
}

This is a simple solution to the problem, we simply iterate through the vector from the second element (index 1) to the end of the vector with a step of 2 (i.e. we only consider the elements at odd indices), and if the element is even, we add it to the sum.

int main() {
    int arr[] = {4, 2, 6, 7};
    int sum = 0;
    for(int i=1; i<4; i+=2){
        if(arr[i]%2 == 0){
            sum += arr[i];
        }
    }
    printf("%d\n", sum);
    return 0;
}
// Output: 2

/*
Explanation:
4 is the first element, which is at index 0, which is even.
2 is the second element, which is at index 1, which is odd.
6 is the third element, which is at index 2, which is even.
7 is the fourth element, which is at index 3, which is odd.

The even elements at odd indices are 2 and 6.
The sum of these elements is 2 + 6 = 8.

So, the function should return 8, but the problem states to return the sum of the even elements at odd indices, which is 2.
