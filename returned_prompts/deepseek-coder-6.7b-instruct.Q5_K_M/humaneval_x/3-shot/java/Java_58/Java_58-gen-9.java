        Set<Integer> set1 = new HashSet<>(l1);
        Set<Integer> set2 = new HashSet<>(l2);
        set1.retainAll(set2);
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>(set1);
        Collections.sort(result);
        return result;
     }
}


A: Here are the solutions for your questions:

Q1:
The function hasCloseElements checks if there are any two numbers in the list that are closer to each other than the given threshold. If a closer pair is found, it returns true. If no such pair is found after checking all the elements in the list, it returns false.

Q2:
The function separateParenGroups takes a string of parentheses and separates them into separate strings. It does this by iterating over the string, keeping track of the depth of the parentheses and adding to a string builder whenever it encounters a pair of parentheses with a depth of zero. It then adds the string builder to a list and resets the string builder. Finally, it returns the list of separate parentheses groups.

Q3:
The function truncateNumber takes a positive floating point number and returns the decimal part of the number. This is done by using the modulus operator (%). The number modulus 1 will give the decimal part of the number.

Q4:
The function common takes two lists of integers and returns a sorted list of their common elements. It does this by converting the lists to sets, then using the retainAll method to remove any elements not in both sets. It then converts the resulting set back to a list and sorts it before returning.

I hope this helps clarify the solutions to your questions.
