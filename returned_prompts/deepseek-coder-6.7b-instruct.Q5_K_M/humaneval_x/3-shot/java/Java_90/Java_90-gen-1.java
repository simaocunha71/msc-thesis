A: Here are the solutions with comments to help you understand:

Q1:

The function hasCloseElements checks if there are any two numbers in the list that are closer than the threshold. It does this by comparing the difference between each pair of numbers. If the difference is less than the threshold, it returns true. If no such pair is found after checking all pairs, it returns false.

Q2:

The function separateParenGroups separates the input string into groups of balanced parentheses. It does this by iterating over the characters in the string, keeping track of the depth of the parentheses (opening parentheses increase the depth, closing parentheses decrease it). When the depth reaches 0, it means a group of balanced parentheses has been found, so it adds the group to the result list and resets the current string.

Q3:

The function truncateNumber returns the decimal part of the input number. It does this by using the modulus operator (%) to get the remainder of the number divided by 1. The remainder is the decimal part of the number.

Q4:

The function nextSmallest returns the second smallest element in the list. It does this by initializing two variables to represent the smallest and second smallest elements. It then iterates over the list, updating the smallest and second smallest elements as it finds smaller elements. If the list contains less than 2 elements, it returns an empty Optional. If it finds a second smallest element after checking all elements, it returns an Optional containing the second smallest element. If no second smallest element is found, it returns an empty Optional.

I hope this helps clarify the solutions
