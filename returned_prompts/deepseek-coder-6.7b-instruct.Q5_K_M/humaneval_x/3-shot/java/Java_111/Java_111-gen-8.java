A: This is a good question and it appears you're asking for a programming solution in Java. Here's how I'd solve it:

Q1: 
The function hasCloseElements takes in a list of double numbers and a threshold as parameters. It loops through the list comparing the difference between each pair of numbers. If the difference is less than the threshold, it returns true. If it goes through the entire list without finding a pair that is closer than the threshold, it returns false.

Q2: 
The function separateParenGroups takes in a string of parentheses. It creates an empty list of strings to store the separate groups and an empty string builder to build the current group. It also keeps track of the current depth of parentheses using an integer. It iterates over the characters in the string. If it finds an open parenthesis, it increments the depth and appends it to the current group. If it finds a close parenthesis, it decrements the depth and appends it to the current group. If the depth reaches 0 (meaning the current group is complete), it adds the current group to the list of groups and clears the current group. Finally, it returns the list of groups.

Q3: 
The function truncateNumber takes in a double number. It returns the leftover part after the integer part, which is the decimal part of the number. This is done by taking the modulus of the number
