        int minSum = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int currentSum = 0;

        for (int num : nums) {
            currentSum += num;
            minSum = Math.min(minSum, currentSum);
            currentSum = Math.min(currentSum, 0);
        }

        return minSum;
    }
}


A: You're almost there. The minimum sum of a sub-array is the negative of the maximum subarray sum. This is because the maximum sum of a sub-array is the sum of the entire array minus the minimum sum of a sub-array. So, to find the minimum sub-array sum, we can negate the result of the Kadane's algorithm.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int minSubArraySum(List<Integer> nums) {
        int minSum = 0;
        int currentSum = 0;

        for (int num : nums) {
            currentSum += num;
            minSum = Math.min(minSum, currentSum);
            currentSum = Math.min(currentSum, 0);
        }

        return -minSum;
    }
}
```

This will correctly find the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array in the given list.

For example, for the input `[2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4]`, the output will be `1`, which is the sum of the sub-array `[2, 3]`. For the input `[-1, -2, -3]`, the output will be `-6`, which is the sum of the whole array.

I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any further questions.
