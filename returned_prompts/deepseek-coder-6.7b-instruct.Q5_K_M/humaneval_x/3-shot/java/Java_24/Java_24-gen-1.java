        for  (int i = n  - 1; i > 0; i--) {
            if  (n  % i == 0) {
                return i;
             }
         }

        return -1; // If no divisors found

A: You can solve this problem with a simple loop that starts from the half of the given number and goes down to 1. If the number is divisible by the current iterator, you return that number. Otherwise, you continue the loop.

Here is the Java code for this:

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    /**
    For a given number n, find the largest number that divides n evenly, smaller than n
    >>> largestDivisor(15)
    5
    */
    public int largestDivisor(int n) {
        for(int i = n / 2; i > 0; i--) {
            if(n % i == 0) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        return -1; // If no divisors found
    }
}
```

This code works by dividing the input number by each integer from half of the number down to 1. If the result of the division is an integer (i.e., the remainder is 0), then the current integer is a divisor of the input number, and the function returns it.

If the function completes the loop without finding a divisor, it returns -1 to indicate that no divisors were found.

Note: The function `largestDivisor(int n)` assumes that the input number is a positive integer. If the input number could be 0 or negative, you should add appropriate error checking to handle these cases.

Additionally, for performance reasons, this function could be optimized further by not checking even numbers other than 2 (since any even number greater than 2 will never be a divisor of an odd number) and by not checking numbers greater than the square root of the input number (since a larger factor would have already been found when checking smaller numbers).

However, these optimizations are not necessary in this case since the function is intended to solve a specific problem.

This function has a time complexity of O(
