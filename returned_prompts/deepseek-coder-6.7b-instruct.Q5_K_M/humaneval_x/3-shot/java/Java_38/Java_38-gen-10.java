A: This code finds a root of a polynomial, but it's not guaranteed that it will find the root. That's because the polynomial may not have real roots and the method used here is a brute-force search.
Here is a version of the code that uses the Newton-Raphson method to find roots. This method is more robust and accurate.

```go
import (
    "math"
)

func Poly(xs []float64, x float64) float64 {
    sum := 0.0
    for i, coeff := range xs {
        sum += coeff * math.Pow(x, float64(i))
    }
    return sum
}

func Derivative(xs []float64) []float64 {
    derivative := make([]float64, len(xs)-1)
    for i := 1; i < len(xs); i++ {
        derivative[i-1] = float64(i) * xs[i]
    }
    return derivative
}

func FindZero(xs []float64) float64 {
    var x float64 = 0.0
    for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {
        if math.Abs(Poly(xs, x)) < 1e-6 {
            return
