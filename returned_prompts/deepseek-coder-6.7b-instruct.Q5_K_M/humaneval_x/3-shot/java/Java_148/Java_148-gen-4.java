A: Your code seems to have some issues:


*

*In your first code, you have some variables misspelled (like "distance" instead of "threshold").

*In your second code, you are not considering spaces in your string. You can use the method trim() to remove these spaces.

*In your third code, you are using the modulus operator (%) incorrectly. It should return the remainder of the division of number by 1.0, not 1.

*In the fourth code, you have not considered the fact that the planets are ordered in the solar system. You need to sort the planets based on their position in the solar system.


Here is the corrected code:
