        Map<String, Integer> wordToNum = new HashMap<String, Integer>() {{
            put("zero", 0); put("one", 1); put("two", 2); put("three", 3);
            put("four", 4); put("five", 5); put("six", 6); put("seven", 7);
            put("eight", 8); put("nine", 9);
        }};

        List<String> numWords = Arrays.asList(numbers.split(" "));
        numWords.sort(Comparator.comparing(word -> wordToNum.get(word)));

        return String.join(" ", numWords);
    }
}


A: This is a simple problem which can be solved in many ways, here I am solving it by using a simple sorting. The key point here is to sort the strings according to their corresponding numerical values.

Here is the solution in Python:

```python
def sortNumbers(numbers):
    wordToNum = {"zero": 0, "one": 1, "two": 2, "three": 3, "four": 4, "five": 5, "six": 6, "seven": 7, "eight": 8, "nine": 9}
    numWords = numbers.split(" ")
    numWords.sort(key=lambda word: wordToNum[word])
    return " ".join(numWords)
```

In this solution, I have created a dictionary to map the words to their corresponding numerical values. Then I split the input string into a list of words. I sort this list of words based on their numerical values. Finally, I join the sorted words back into a string and return it.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) because of the sorting operation. The space complexity is O(n) because we are storing the words in a list.

Here is how to use this function:

```python
print(sortNumbers("three one five"))  # Output: "one three five"
```

This will sort the words in the input string based on their numerical values and return the sorted string.
