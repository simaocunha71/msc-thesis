A: The given solutions seem correct. They are all using the proper logic to solve the given problem.

For Q1, it is checking if the absolute difference between any two elements in the list is less than the given threshold.

For Q2, it is separating the string into separate balanced parentheses groups.

For Q3, it is returning the decimal part of the given number.

For Q4, it is implementing the Fibonacci sequence with a modification to the rule to add the sum of the last four numbers in the sequence instead of the last two.

All these solutions are written in Java and they are correctly implemented according to the problem statement.

I hope this helps to understand the solutions.

A: import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;

class Solution {
    /**
    Given a non-negative integer num, return an array consisting of all the even integers from 0 to num inclusive.
    >>> evenNumbers(10)
    [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
    */
    public List<Integer> evenNumbers(int num) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i <= num; i += 2) {
            result.add(i);
        }
        return result;
    }
}

This solution works by iterating from 0 to num with a step of 2 in each iteration. In each iteration, it adds the current number i to the result list.
