  let maxIndex = -1;
  
  for(let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++){
    if(arr[i] < arr[i-1]){
      maxIndex = Math.max(maxIndex, i);
    }
  }
  
  return maxIndex;
}
console.log(canArrange([1,2,4,3,5])); // 3
console.log(canArrange([1,2,3])); // -1
console.log(canArrange([5,4,3,2,1])); // 1

//This code works by iterating over the array from the second element to the end. It checks if the current element is less than the previous one. If it is, it updates the maxIndex to the current index. At the end, it returns maxIndex. If no such element exists, maxIndex will remain -1 and will be returned.

//It's worth mentioning that this code assumes that the input array will not contain duplicate values, as per the problem statement.

//The time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the length of the array. This is because it only requires a single pass through the array to determine the result.

//The space complexity of this code is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the maxIndex and the array elements.

//This code could be further optimized by starting the loop from the end to the beginning, as it would be more efficient in the case of a large array.

//Note: The problem statement mentions that the given array will not contain duplicate values. However, if duplicate values were allowed, then the code would need to be modified to handle that case.
