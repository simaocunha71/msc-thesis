        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++) {
            result.add(numbers.get(i));
            if (i < numbers.size() - 1) {
                result.add(delimiter);

    }
}


A: The answers provided are correct.

Here is the explanation of the solutions:

Q1:
This program is checking if any two numbers in the list are closer to each other than the given threshold. It does this by iterating over all pairs of numbers in the list and checking if the absolute difference between them is less than the threshold.

Q2:
This program is separating groups of balanced parentheses from a given string. It does this by iterating over the characters in the string, keeping track of the current depth of parentheses and adding characters to a StringBuilder until the depth reaches zero (indicating the end of a group). The resulting groups are then added to a list.

Q3:
This program is returning the decimal part of a given number. It does this by taking the remainder of the number when divided by 1 (which gives the decimal part).

Q4:
This program is inserting a given delimiter between every two consecutive elements of a given list. It does this by iterating over the elements of the list, adding them to a new list, and then adding the delimiter after each element except for the last.

Each solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the input list, because it iterates over the elements of the list once. The space complexity is also O(n), because it creates a new list to store the results.

In summary, these solutions are correct and should work for the provided examples.
