A: The first question is about checking if there are any two numbers in a list that are closer together than a specified threshold. It does this by looping through the list and comparing each pair of numbers to see if their difference is less than the specified threshold.

The second question is about separating groups of balanced parentheses from a string. It does this by keeping track of the depth of nested parentheses and adding each group of balanced parentheses to the result list.

The third question is about getting the decimal part of a number. It does this by taking the remainder of the number when divided by 1.

The fourth question is about sorting integers from 1 to 9, reversing the resulting list, and replacing each integer with its word equivalent. It does this by sorting the list in descending order, then replacing each integer with its word equivalent using a switch statement.

All of these questions involve manipulating lists and numbers, which are common operations in programming.

The answers for these questions are all in Java.

In the first question, the answer uses a nested for loop to compare each pair of numbers. The outer loop starts at the beginning of the list and the inner loop starts at the next index. The
