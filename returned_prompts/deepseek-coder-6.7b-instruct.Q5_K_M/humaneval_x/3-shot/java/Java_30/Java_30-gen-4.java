        return l.stream().filter(i -> i > 0).collect(Collectors.toList());
     }
}


A: You're almost there, you just need to import the correct libraries. Here's your corrected code:

```
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

class Solution  {

    public List<Integer> getPositive(List<Integer> l) {
        return l.stream().filter(i -> i > 0).collect(Collectors.toList());
    }

}
```

This code will return a list of all positive integers in the input list. It uses Java 8's Stream API to filter out any numbers that are not greater than 0.

Please note that in your question you mentioned "Return only positive numbers in the list", but in your example you're returning negative numbers as well. If you only want positive numbers, please adjust the filter condition accordingly.

I hope this helps, let me know if you have any questions.
