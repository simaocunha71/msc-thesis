The above code is part of a test script for the `couchdb` library.

This script is testing the HTTP POST request to create a new `asset_type` in the CouchDB database.

The `json_dict` dictionary is created with the necessary data for the POST request.

The `jsonpickle` library is used to encode the `json_dict` dictionary into a JSON string called `new_asset_type_body`.

The `self.logger.info` function is used to log the JSON data.

The `self.app.post` function is used to make the HTTP POST request to the specified `url` with the `content_type` set to `'application/json'` and the `data` set to the `new_asset_type_body`.

The response from the POST request is stored in the `postResponse` variable.

If the Python version is greater than 3.0, the `postResponse` data is decoded from UTF-8.

The `self.logger.debug` function is used to log the response data.
