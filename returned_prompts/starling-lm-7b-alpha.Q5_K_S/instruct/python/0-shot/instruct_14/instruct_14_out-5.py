This function will be called by the test runner.

Here is an outline of the function:

    Create a logger instance using the standard library logging library.

    Create a JSON string that represents the asset type to be deleted.

    Use the requests library to send a POST request to the API endpoint for creating an asset type.

    If the status code of the response is not 201, log an error message and return the status code.

    Use the requests library to send a GET request to the API endpoint for retrieving the created asset type.

    If the status code of the response is not 200, log an error message and return the status code.

    Use the requests library to send a DELETE request to the API endpoint for deleting the asset type.

    If the status code of the response is not 204, log an error message and return the status code.

    Return the status code of the DELETE request.

Here are some tips for getting started:

    Import the necessary libraries: logging, json, and requests.

    Create a logger instance using the logging library: logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

    Create a JSON string that represents the asset type to be deleted: asset_type_json = json.dumps(asset_type)

    Use the requests library to send a POST request to the API endpoint for creating an asset type: response = requests.post(url, json=asset_type_json)

    Check the status code of the response and log an error message if it is not 201: if response.status_code != 201: logger.error(f"Error creating asset type: {response.status_code}") return response.status_code

    Use the requests library to send a GET request to the API endpoint for retrieving the created asset type: response = requests.get(url)

    Check the status code of the response and log an error message if it is not 200: if response.status_code != 200: logger.error(f"Error retrieving created asset type: {response.status_code}") return response.status_code

    Use the requests library to send a DELETE request to the API endpoint for deleting the asset type: response =
