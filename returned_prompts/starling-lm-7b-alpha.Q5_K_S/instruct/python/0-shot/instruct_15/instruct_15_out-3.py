    Here are some tips to help you get started:

    Use the requests library to send HTTP requests.
    Use the requests.post() function to send a POST request to the server.
    Use the requests.delete() function to send a DELETE request to the server.
    Use the json parameter of the requests.post() and requests.delete() functions to include a JSON payload in the request.
    Use the params parameter of the requests.delete() function to include a query parameter in the request.
    Use the response.json() function to decode the response.
    Use the in operator to check if a key and value are present in the decoded response.

Here's an example of how you can write the function:

    import requests

    def send_requests(url, payload, query_param):
        response = requests.post(url, json=payload)
        response.raise_for_status()
        if 'key' in response.json() and 'value' in response.json():
            return response.json()
        else:
            raise ValueError("Key and value not found in response")

        response = requests.delete(url, params=query_param)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()

In this example, the function sends a POST request to the server with the specified URL and JSON payload. It then checks if the response contains the desired key and value. If so, it sends a DELETE request to the server with the specified query parameter and returns the decoded response as a dictionary. If the key and value are not present in the response, it raises a ValueError.

Make sure to replace the URL, payload, and query_param variables with your own values.

This function can be called like this:

    send_requests(url, payload, query_param)

Remember to import the requests library at the beginning of your program.

If you have any questions or need clarification, feel free to ask. Good luck with your code!
