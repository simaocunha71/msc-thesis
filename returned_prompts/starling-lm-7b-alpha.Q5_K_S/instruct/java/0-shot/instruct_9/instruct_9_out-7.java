Here's an example of how you might implement this method:

```
public String parseXML(InputStream inputStream) {
    String result = null;
    SAXParserFactory spf = SAXParserFactory.newInstance();
    try {
        SAXParser sp = spf.newSAXParser();
        CustomXMLHandler handler = new CustomXMLHandler();
        sp.parse(inputStream, handler);
        result = handler.getResult();
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    return result;
}
```

In this example, the `parseXML` method takes an `InputStream` as a parameter and returns a `String` containing the result of the XML parsing. It first creates a `SAXParserFactory` and a `SAXParser` using the factory. Then, it creates an instance of a custom `XMLHandler` class and delegates the parsing to this handler using the `parse` method of the `SAXParser`. Finally, it retrieves the result from the handler and returns it.

Note that this example does not include the validation of the XML against a distributed system configuration. You would need to add additional logic to perform this validation.

Additionally, it's important to handle any exceptions that may occur during the parsing process, as shown in the example. You can add more specific exception handling if needed.

Lastly, make sure to import the necessary classes and libraries, such as `java.io.*`, `javax.xml.*`, and `org.xml.sax.*`, to use the `InputStream`, `SAXParserFactory`, `SAXParser`, and `XMLHandler` classes in your code.

By following these steps, you can create a Java method that parses an XML input stream using a SAXParser, validates the XML against a distributed system configuration, and delegates the parsing to a custom handler.

Here is an example of how you can implement the `CustomXMLHandler` class:

```java
import org.xml.sax.Attributes;
import org.xml.sax.SAXException;
import org.xml.sax.helpers.DefaultHandler;

import javax.xml.XMLConstants;
import javax.xml.transform.Transformer;
import javax.xml.transform.
