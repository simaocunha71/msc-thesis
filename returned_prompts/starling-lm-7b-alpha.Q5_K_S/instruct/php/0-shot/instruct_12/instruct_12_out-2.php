    Here is an example of how you might define the class:

```php
<?php
class Assets {
    public $basePath;
    public $baseUrl;
    public $css = array();
    public $js = array();
    public $dependencies = array();

    public function __construct($basePath, $baseUrl) {
        $this->basePath = $basePath;
        $this->baseUrl = $baseUrl;
    }

    public function addCssFile($file) {
        $this->css[] = $file;
    }

    public function addJsFile($file) {
        $this->js[] = $file;
    }

    public function addDependency($dependency) {
        $this->dependencies[] = $dependency;
    }
}
?>
```

In the code above, we define a class called Assets that has several public properties: `basePath`, `baseUrl`, `css`, `js`, and `dependencies`. The class also has a constructor that takes in a `basePath` and `baseUrl` and assigns them to the corresponding properties.

The class has three methods:

- `addCssFile($file)`: This method adds a CSS file to the `css` property of the class. It takes in a file path as a parameter and appends it to the `css` property as an array element.

- `addJsFile($file)`: This method adds a JavaScript file to the `js` property of the class. It takes in a file path as a parameter and appends it to the `js` property as an array element.

- `addDependency($dependency)`: This method adds a dependency to the `dependencies` property of the class. It takes in a dependency as a parameter and appends it to the `dependencies` property as an array element.

By using this class, you can easily manage and organize the assets for your web application, including specifying the base path, base URL, CSS files, JavaScript files, and dependencies.

Here's an example of how you can use this class:

```php
$basePath = 'path/to/assets';
$baseUrl = 'http://example.com/
