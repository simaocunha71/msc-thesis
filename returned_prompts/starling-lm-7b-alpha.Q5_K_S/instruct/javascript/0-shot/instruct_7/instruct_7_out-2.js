Here's an example implementation of the function:

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stddef.h>

void* copy_bytes(size_t n, const struct Buffer* list) {
    void* buf = Buffer.allocUnsafe(n);
    const struct Buffer* cur = list;
    size_t total = 0;

    while (n > 0 && cur != NULL) {
        size_t len = cur->len;
        if (len < n) {
            memcpy(buf + total, cur->data, len);
            total += len;
            n -= len;
        } else {
            memcpy(buf + total, cur->data, n);
            total += n;
            n = 0;
        }
        cur = cur->next;
    }

    return buf;
}
```

This function first allocates a new buffer using `Buffer.allocUnsafe(n)` to ensure that the buffer is aligned properly. Then, it iterates through the list of buffered data chunks, copying the data from each chunk to the newly allocated buffer until the specified number of bytes have been copied. The function uses `memcpy()` to perform the actual copying of data, and keeps track of the total number of bytes copied and the remaining number of bytes to copy. Finally, the function returns the newly allocated buffer containing the copied data.

Note that this implementation assumes that the `Buffer` structure has a `data` field of type `void*` and a `len` field of type `size_t`, as well as a `next` field of type `struct Buffer*` to form a linked list of buffered data chunks. You may need to modify this implementation based on the specific structure of your buffered data chunks.

Additionally, please note that this implementation does not use any application-specific variables or libraries, as requested in the question.

Lastly, it's worth mentioning that this function is designed to be inlinable, meaning that the compiler can choose to inline the function at its call site if it determines that inlining is beneficial. This can help optimize the performance of the code by reducing function call overhead and improving instruction-level parallelism.

Please keep all the code in the question intact and
