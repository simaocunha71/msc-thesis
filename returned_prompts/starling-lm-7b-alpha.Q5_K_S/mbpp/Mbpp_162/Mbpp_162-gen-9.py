```
def sum_series(n):
    return n*(n+1)//2
```

Explanation:

This function calculates the sum of the series (n - 2*i) from i=0 to n // 2, which is equivalent to the sum of the series (n + (n-2) + (n-4)... (until n-x =< 0). The function is defined as follows:

```python
def sum_series(n):
```

The function takes a single parameter `n`, which is the upper limit of the series. It returns the sum of the series.

```python
    return n*(n+1)//2
```

The sum of the series can be calculated using the formula `n*(n+1)//2`. This formula is derived from the arithmetic series formula, which states that the sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms. In this case, the first term is `n`, the last term is `n - 2*(n // 2)`, and the number of terms is `n // 2`.

The function can be tested using the `assert` statement to verify that it returns the correct result for the given example:

```python
assert sum_series(6) == 12
```

This assertion checks if the function returns 12 when given the argument 6. If the assertion passes, it means that the function is correct.

Overall, the function `sum_series(n)` calculates the sum of the series (n - 2*i) from i=0 to n // 2, and returns the result.

Explanation:

The given problem can be solved by using the arithmetic series formula, which states that the sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms. In this case, the first term is `n`, the last term is `n - 2*(n // 2)`, and the number of terms is `n // 2`. The sum of the series can be calculated using the formula `n*(n+1)//2`.
