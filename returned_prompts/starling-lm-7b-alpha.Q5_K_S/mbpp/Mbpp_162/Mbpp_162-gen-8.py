```python
def sum_series(n):
    return n * (n + 1) // 2
```

This function calculates the sum of the series (n - 2*i) from i = 0 to n // 2. Here's how it works:

- The function `sum_series(n)` takes a single argument `n`, which is the upper limit of the series.
- The expression `n * (n + 1) // 2` calculates the sum of the series.
- `n * (n + 1)` calculates the sum of an arithmetic series from 1 to n, with a common difference of 1.
- The `// 2` operation divides the sum by 2, effectively removing the need to consider every other term in the series.
- The function returns the calculated sum as the result.

For example, if we call `sum_series(6)`, the function will calculate the sum of the series (6 - 2*0) + (6 - 2*1) + (6 - 2*2) + ... + (6 - 2*2) = 12, and return 12 as the result.

Note that the series only includes terms up to n // 2, so for odd values of n, the series will only include the first term.

Here are some additional examples:

- `sum_series(7)` returns 21 (7 - 2*0 + 7 - 2*1 + 7 - 2*2)
- `sum_series(8)` returns 28 (7 - 2*0 + 7 - 2*1 + 7 - 2*2 + 7 - 2*3)
- `sum_series(9)` returns 36 (7 - 2*0 + 7 - 2*1 + 7 - 2*2 + 7 - 2*3 + 7 - 2*4)

In general, the function calculates the sum of the series (n - 2*i) from i = 0 to n // 2 efficiently using the formula `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
