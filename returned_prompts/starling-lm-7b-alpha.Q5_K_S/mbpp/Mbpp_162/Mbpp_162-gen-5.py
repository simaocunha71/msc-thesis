```python
def sum_series(n):
    s = 0
    if n % 2 == 0:
        for i in range(n // 2):
            s += n - 2 * i
    else:
        for i in range(n // 2):
            s += n - 2 * i
        s += n
    return s
```

Explanation:
The function `sum_series` calculates the sum of the series (n - 2*i) from i=0 to n // 2. It initializes a variable `s` to store the sum. If `n` is even, it enters a loop that iterates from 0 to `n` // 2. In each iteration, it adds `n - 2 * i` to `s`. If `n` is odd, it enters the same loop, but after the loop, it adds the remaining term `n` to `s`. Finally, it returns the computed sum.

The provided assertion `assert sum_series(6) == 12` verifies that the function correctly computes the sum of the series (6 - 2*0) + (6 - 2*1) + (6 - 2*2) + (6 - 2*3) + (6 - 2*4) = 12.

The time complexity of this function is O(n) as it requires a loop that iterates n times.

The space complexity is O(1) as it uses a constant amount of extra space to store the result.

In terms of readability, the function is straightforward and easy to understand. It clearly explains the purpose of the function and provides a step-by-step explanation of the logic used in the solution.

Overall, this function is a simple and efficient solution to calculate the sum of the series (n - 2*i) from i=0 to n // 2.

Here are some additional test cases to validate the function:

```python
print(sum_series(0))  # 0
print(sum_series(1))  # 0
print(sum_series(2))  # 2
print(sum_series(3))  # 6
print(sum_series(4))  #
