Here's one way you could approach this problem:

```python
def sum_Of_Subarray_Prod(lst):
    n = len(lst)
    total = 0
    for i in range(1 << n):
        product = 1
        for j in range(n):
            if (i & (1 << j)):
                product *= lst[j]
        total += product
    return total
```

This function works by iterating over all possible subsets of the list, using bitmasks to keep track of which elements are included in each subset. For each subset, it calculates the product of the included elements, and adds this product to the total sum. 

For example, if the input list is [1, 2, 3], the function will consider all possible subsets: [1], [2], [1, 2], [3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3], and [3, 1, 2, 3]. The products of these subsets are: 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 6, and 24, respectively. Adding these up gives the total sum of 20, as expected.

This function is quite efficient, as it only requires O(n) time and space complexity.

However, please note that this solution is not very readable, and may be difficult to understand or maintain.

Here's a more readable version of the function, using a recursive approach:

```python
def sum_Of_Subarray_Prod(lst):
    if len(lst) == 0:
        return 0
    if len(lst) == 1:
        return lst[0]
    total = 0
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        total += lst[i] * sum_Of_Subarray_Prod(lst[:i] + lst[i+1:])
    return total
```

This function works by recursively splitting the list into two sublists, and multiplying the first element of the original list by the sum of the products of the sublists. This process is repeated for each element in the list
