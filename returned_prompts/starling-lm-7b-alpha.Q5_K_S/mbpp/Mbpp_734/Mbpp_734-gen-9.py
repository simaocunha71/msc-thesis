Here's a Python function that should solve the problem:

```python
def sum_Of_Subarray_Prod(nums):
    # Initialize result
    result = 0
    # Loop through all possible sublists
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i, len(nums)):
            # Calculate product of sublist elements and add to result
            result += reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, nums[i:j + 1])
    return result
```

Explanation:
In this function, we use two nested loops to iterate through all possible sublists of the given list. The outer loop iterates over the starting index of the sublist, while the inner loop iterates over the ending index. We then use the `reduce` function from the `functools` module to calculate the product of the elements in the current sublist, and add it to the result. Finally, we return the total sum of all products.

The `reduce` function takes a function and a sequence as arguments, and applies the function to the first two elements of the sequence, then to the result and the next element, and so on, until the sequence is exhausted. In this case, we use a lambda function to perform element-wise multiplication.

To verify the correctness of the function, we can use the `assert` statement to check if the result of calling the function with a specific list matches the expected output.

Here's an example usage of the function:

```python
print(sum_Of_Subarray_Prod([1,2,3]))  # Output: 20
```

This will print the sum of products of all possible sublists of the list `[1, 2, 3]`, which is indeed 20.
