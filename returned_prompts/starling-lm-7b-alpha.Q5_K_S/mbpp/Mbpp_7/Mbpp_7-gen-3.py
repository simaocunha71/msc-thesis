# Here is the Python code to find all words which are at least 4 characters long in a string:

def find_char_long(str):
    return [word for word in str.split() if len(word) >= 4]

# Test Case:
print(set(find_char_long('Please move back to stream'))) # Output: {'Please', 'move', 'back', 'stream'}

# Explanation:
# In the function find_char_long, we split the given string into a list of words using the split() function. We then use a list comprehension to filter out all the words that have a length less than 4. The resulting list is returned.

# The assert statement is used to check if the function find_char_long is correctly identifying all the words with a length greater than or equal to 4 in the given string. The set() function is used to convert the list into a set to remove duplicate words. The set() function is also used to compare the result with the expected set of words.
