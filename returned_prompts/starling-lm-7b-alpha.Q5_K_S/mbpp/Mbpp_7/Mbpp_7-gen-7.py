"""
The above program will return a set of all the words with length greater than 4. The function `find_char_long` takes a string as an argument and splits it into a list of words. It then uses a list comprehension to filter out all the words that have a length of less than 4. Finally, it returns the resulting list of words.
"""

"""
In the above code, the function `find_char_long` uses the `split` method to convert the input string into a list of words. It then uses a list comprehension to iterate over each word in the list and checks if the length of the word is greater than or equal to 4. If the condition is true, the word is added to the resulting list. The `set` function is used to convert the resulting list into a set to remove any duplicate words. Finally, the set of words is returned by the function.

"""
The `split` method in Python is used to split a string into a list of substrings. By default, it splits the string at whitespace characters and returns a list of the resulting substrings. In the above code, the `split` method is used to split the input string into a list of words.
"""

"""
The `len` function in Python returns the number of characters in a string. In the above code, the `len` function is used to check the length of each word in the list. If the length of the word is greater than or equal to 4, the word is added to the resulting list.

"""
The `set` function in Python creates a new set with the specified elements. In the above code, the `set` function is used to convert the resulting list of words into a set to remove any duplicate words. The resulting set of words is then returned by the function.
