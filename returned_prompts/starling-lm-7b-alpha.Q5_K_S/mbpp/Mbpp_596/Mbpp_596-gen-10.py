"""
The above code will print the size in bytes of the given tuple. As per the requirement, it uses sys.getsizeof() function to calculate the size of the tuple.

# Complexity Analysis
# Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the tuple.
# Space Complexity: O(1), constant extra space is used to store the tuple.

# Stability: The relative order of items in the tuple is preserved.
# Online / Offline: It is an offline algorithm as it requires the tuple to be present in the memory.
