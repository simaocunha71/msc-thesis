"""
The function `tuple_size(t)` returns the size in bytes of the given tuple. This is done by using the `getsizeof` function from the `sys` module, which returns the size of the object passed as an argument. The function takes a tuple as an argument, and returns the size of that tuple in bytes.

The assertion is used to verify the correctness of the function. It checks if the result of calling the `tuple_size` function with the tuple `("A", 1, "B", 2, "C", 3)` is equal to the result of calling the `getsizeof` function with the same tuple. If the two results are equal, the assertion passes, and if they are not equal, the assertion fails.

"""
The function `tuple_size(t)` uses the `sys.getsizeof()` function to calculate the size in bytes of a given tuple. The `sys.getsizeof()` function returns the size of the object passed as an argument. In this case, the function `tuple_size(t)` returns the size of the tuple `t`.

The assertion `assert tuple_size(("A", 1, "B", 2, "C", 3)) == sys.getsizeof(("A", 1, "B", 2, "C", 3))` is used to verify the correctness of the function. It compares the result of calling the `tuple_size` function with the tuple `("A", 1, "B", 2, "C", 3)` with the result of calling the `sys.getsizeof` function with the same tuple.
