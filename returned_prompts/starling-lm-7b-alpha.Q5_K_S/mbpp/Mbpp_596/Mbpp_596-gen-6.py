Here's a Python program to solve this problem:

```python
def tuple_size(t):
    return sys.getsizeof(t)
```

You can test the function with the following code:

```python
import sys

assert tuple_size(("A", 1, "B", 2, "C", 3) ) == sys.getsizeof(("A", 1, "B", 2, "C", 3))
```

This test will pass if the function correctly calculates the size of the tuple in bytes.

```python
def tuple_size(t):
    return sys.getsizeof(t)
```

This function uses Python's `sys.getsizeof()` built-in function to calculate the size of the tuple. It takes a tuple as an argument and returns the size of the tuple in bytes.

The `assert` statement is used to check if the function correctly calculates the size of the tuple. It compares the result of the function with the result of the `sys.getsizeof()` function on the same tuple. If the two results are equal, the assertion will pass and the program will continue running; otherwise, an `AssertionError` will be raised.

By using the `sys.getsizeof()` function, you can accurately calculate the size of a tuple in bytes, regardless of the data it contains.

Here are a few additional details about this solution:

- The `sys.getsizeof()` function is a built-in Python function that returns the size of an object in bytes. It is used here to calculate the size of the tuple.
- The `assert` statement is used to check if the function correctly calculates the size of the tuple. If the function's result is not equal to the result of `sys.getsizeof()`, an `AssertionError` will be raised.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.
