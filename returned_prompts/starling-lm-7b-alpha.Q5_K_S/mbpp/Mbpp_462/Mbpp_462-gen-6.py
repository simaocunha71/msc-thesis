"""
The combinations_list(list) function takes a list of elements as an argument and returns a list of lists, where each sublist contains all the possible combinations of the elements in the original list.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the function works:

1. The function starts by checking the length of the input list.
2. If the length of the list is 0, it means that there are no elements in the list. In this case, an empty list is returned.
3. If the length of the list is 1, it means that there is only one element in the list. In this case, a list containing that single element is returned.
4. For each element in the list, the function recursively calls itself with the remaining elements. This is done to generate all possible combinations of the elements.
5. The function stores all the sublists generated in the previous step in the result list.
6. Finally, the function returns the result list, which contains all the possible combinations of the elements in the original list.

In the given assertion, the combinations_list(['orange', 'red', 'green', 'blue']) function is called with a list of four elements. The expected result is a list of lists, where each sublist represents a different combination of the elements in the original list.

The provided solution correctly implements the combinations_list function and returns the expected result.
