In this case, the area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle with a given radius r is a right triangle with one leg equal to the radius and the other leg equal to the hypotenuse of a 30-60-90 triangle with hypotenuse equal to the diameter of the circle. The area of a triangle is given by the formula A = 1/2bh, where b is the base and h is the height. In this case, the base is equal to the radius of the circle and the height is the diameter of the circle divided by 2. Therefore, the area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle with a given radius is (1/2)(r)(d/2), where d is the diameter of the circle. The diameter of the circle is twice the radius, so the area is (1/2)(r)(2r) = r^2. The function triangle_area(r) takes a radius r as input and returns the area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle with that radius. The function first checks if the radius is less than 0 and returns None if it is. Otherwise, it calculates the area using the formula r^2 and returns the result.
