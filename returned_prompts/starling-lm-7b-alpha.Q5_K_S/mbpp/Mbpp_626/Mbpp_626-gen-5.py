"""
Here is a python function to find the area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle with a given radius:

```python
import math

def triangle_area(radius):
    if radius < 0:
        return None
    else:
        return (math.pi * radius ** 2) / 4
```

This function first checks if the radius is less than zero. If it is, it returns `None` as the area of a triangle cannot be calculated for a negative radius. Otherwise, it calculates the area of the semicircle by taking the square of the radius and multiplying it by pi, then divides this area by four to find the area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed within the semicircle.
```python

def triangle_area(radius):

Otherwise, it calculates the area of the semicircle by taking the square of the radius and multiplying it by pi, then divides this area by four to find the area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed within the semicircle.

Here is an example of how to use this function:

```python
print(triangle_area(3))  # prints 9.4247779607693795
```

This will print the area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle with a radius of 3.

To test the function with a negative radius, you can do the following:

```python
print(triangle_area(-1))  # prints None
```

This will print `None` as the function returns `None` for a negative radius.

To test the function with a zero radius, you can do the following:
