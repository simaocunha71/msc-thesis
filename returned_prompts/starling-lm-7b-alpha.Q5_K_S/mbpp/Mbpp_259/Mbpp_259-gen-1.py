```
def maximize_elements(tuple1, tuple2):
    # Create a list of tuples
    tuples = list(zip(tuple1, tuple2))
    # Sort the list of tuples based on the first element of tuple in descending order
    tuples.sort(key = lambda x: x[0], reverse = True)
    # Sort the list of tuples based on the second element of tuple in ascending order
    tuples.sort(key = lambda x: x[1])
    # Return the list of tuples
    return tuples
```

This function first creates a list of tuples by using the `zip` function to combine the two input tuples. It then sorts the list of tuples based on the first element of each tuple in descending order using the `sort` method and a lambda function as the key. Finally, it sorts the list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple in ascending order and returns the result.

To test the function, you can use the `assert` statement to check if the function's output matches the expected output. In this case, the expected output is `((6, 7), (4, 9), (2, 9), (7, 10))`.

The `maximize_elements` function will return the list of tuples with the elements maximized based on the two input tuples.

Note: The `zip` function is used to combine the two input tuples into a list of tuples, where each tuple contains one element from each input tuple. The `sort` method is used to sort the list of tuples based on the specified keys, and the `lambda` function is used as the key for sorting.

The `assert` statement is used to check if the function's output matches the expected output. If the output does not match the expected output, an `AssertionError` will be raised.

The `return` statement is used to return the result of the function, which is the list of tuples with the elements maximized based on the two input tuples.

Overall, this function provides a way to maximize the elements of two tuples by combining them into a list of tuples, sorting them based on the first and second elements of each tuple, and then returning the result.
