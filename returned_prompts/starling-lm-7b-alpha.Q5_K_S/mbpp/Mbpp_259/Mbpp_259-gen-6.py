"""
In this problem we are given two tuples and we need to maximize the elements in each tuple. We can achieve this by selecting the maximum element from each tuple. We can use a function called `maximize_elements` to perform this operation. The function takes two tuples as input and returns a new tuple with the maximized elements. Here's an implementation of the function:

```python
def maximize_elements(t1, t2):
    res = []
    for i in range(len(t1)):
        if t1[i] > t2[i]:
            res.append(t1[i])
        else:
            res.append(t2[i])
    return tuple(res)
```

In the function, we initialize an empty list `res` to store the maximized elements. We then iterate over the indices of the tuples using a `for` loop. For each index, we compare the elements of the two tuples. If the element in `t1` is greater than the element in `t2`, we append `t1[i]` to `res`. Otherwise, we append `t2[i]` to `res`. Finally, we return the tuple formed by the maximized elements in `res`.

To test the function, we can use the `assert` statement to check if the function returns the expected result for the given example. The assertion `assert maximize_elements(((1, 3), (4, 5), (2, 9), (1, 10)), ((6, 7), (3, 9), (1, 1), (7, 3))) == ((6, 7), (4, 9), (2, 9), (7, 10))` checks if the function correctly maximizes the elements in each tuple. If the condition is true, the function is working correctly; otherwise, there is an error in the implementation.
