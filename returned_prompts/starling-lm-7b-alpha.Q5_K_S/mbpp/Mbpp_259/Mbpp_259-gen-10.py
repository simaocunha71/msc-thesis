# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(1)

# Explanation:
# We can use the itertools.zip_longest function to combine the two tuples.
# Then, we can use the operator.itemgetter function to get the maximum of each combined tuple.
# Finally, we can map the maximum function to the combined tuples and return the result.
"""
The zip_longest function is used to combine the two tuples, allowing us to compare them element by element.
The map function is used to apply the max function to each tuple, and the list function is used to convert the result into a list.
Finally, the assert statement is used to verify that the function correctly maximizes the elements of the two tuples.

# Complexity Analysis:
# Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the tuples.
# This is because we only need to iterate through each element in the tuples once.
# Space complexity: O(1), where 1 is the space used to store the result.
# This is because we only need to store the maximum tuple in memory, regardless of the size of the input tuples.

# The above complexity analysis assumes that the length of the tuples is fixed.
# If the length of the tuples can vary, then the complexity analysis would be different.

In such a case, the time complexity would be O(max(n1, n2)), where n1 and n2 are the lengths of the first and second
