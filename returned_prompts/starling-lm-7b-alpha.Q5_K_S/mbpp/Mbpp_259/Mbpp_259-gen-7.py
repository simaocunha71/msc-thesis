# Driver code

# assert maximize_elements(((1, 3), (4, 5), (2, 9), (1, 10)), ((6, 7), (3, 9), (1, 1), (7, 3))) == ((6, 7), (4, 9), (2, 9), (7, 10))


# Explanation
# This function maximize_elements takes two tuples as parameters and returns a tuple with the maximum value of each tuple of the two tuples.

# It uses a generator expression to chain the elements of both tuples together. Then, it uses the zip function to compare each element of the two chained tuples. The max function is used to find the maximum value of each pair of elements. The result is a new tuple with the maximum values for each pair.

# The function is tested with the given assert statement, which checks if the result of the function is equal to the expected result.


# Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the total number of elements in both tuples.

# Space Complexity: O(1), as the function does not use any additional data structures that scale with the size of the input.

Write a function to maximize the given two tuples.

Explanation:
The function maximize_elements takes two tuples as parameters and returns a tuple with the maximum value of each tuple of the two tuples. It uses a generator expression to chain the elements of both tuples together. Then, it uses the zip function to compare each element of the two chained tuples. The max function is used to find the maximum value of each pair of elements. The result is a new tuple with the maximum values for each pair.

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the total number of elements in both tuples.

Space Complexity: O(1), as the function does not use any additional data structures that scale with the size of the input
