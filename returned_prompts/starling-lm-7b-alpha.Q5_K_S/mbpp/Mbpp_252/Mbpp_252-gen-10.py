"""
Here is a python function that can convert a complex number to polar coordinates:

def convert(num):
    magnitude = abs(num)
    angle = math.atan(num.imag / num.real)
    return (magnitude, angle)

In this function, the magnitude of the complex number is obtained using the abs() function. The angle is calculated using the atan() function from the math module, which takes the imaginary part of the complex number divided by the real part as the argument. The result is a tuple containing the magnitude and angle of the complex number.

To test the function, you can use the assert statement to check if the function correctly converts the complex number 1 to the polar coordinates (1.0, 0.0)."""
