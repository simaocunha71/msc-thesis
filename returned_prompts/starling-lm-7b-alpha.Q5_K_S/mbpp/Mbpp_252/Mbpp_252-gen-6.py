"""
In the convert function, we first calculate the magnitude of the complex number. This is done by using the built-in function `np.abs()`. The magnitude is stored in the variable `r`.

Next, we calculate the angle of the complex number using `np.arctan2(z.imag, z.real)`. The `np.arctan2()` function calculates the arctangent of the quotient of the imaginary and real parts of the complex number. This angle is stored in the variable `theta`.

Finally, we return the magnitude and angle as a tuple `(r, theta)` using the `return` statement. This tuple represents the polar coordinates of the complex number.

The `convert(1)` function call at the end of the code checks if the function is correctly converting the complex number 1 to polar coordinates by asserting that the output is `(1.0, 0.0)`. Since the polar coordinates of the complex number 1 are indeed `(1.0, 0.0)`, the assertion passes and the code runs without any errors.
