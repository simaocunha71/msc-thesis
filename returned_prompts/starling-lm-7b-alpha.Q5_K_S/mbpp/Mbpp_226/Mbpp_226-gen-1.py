odd_values_string('abcdef')



# In the given string "abcdef", there are 6 characters. We need to remove the characters which have odd index values. Odd index values are 1, 3, 5. The characters at odd index values are 'b', 'd' and 'f'. After removing these characters, the new string becomes 'ace'.

# The above python function defines a function named "odd_values_string" which takes a string as an argument. The function initializes an empty string "new_str". It then iterates through each character in the given string using a for loop. If the index of the current character is even (i.e., divisible by 2), it appends the character to the "new_str". Finally, it returns the "new_str" which contains the characters at even index values of the given string.

# The function is tested by calling it with the string 'abcdef' as the argument. The expected output is 'ace', which is the string with the characters at even index values of 'abcdef' removed.

# The function correctly removes the characters at odd index values of the given string and returns the new string as the output.



# The given assertion is incorrect. The function "odd_values_string" returns 'ace' when called with the string 'abcdef' as the argument. However, the expected output in the assertion is 'ade'. This discrepancy may be due to a typographical error in the provided assertion.

# Here is the corrected assertion:

# >>> odd_values_string('abcdef')
# 'ace'
