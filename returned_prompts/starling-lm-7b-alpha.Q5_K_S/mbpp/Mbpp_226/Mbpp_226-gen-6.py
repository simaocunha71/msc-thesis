# Here's the explanation for the above code:
# In the above function, we are iterating through each character in the string using a for loop.
# We check if the index of the current character is odd by using the condition "i % 2 != 0".
# If the index is odd, we add the character to the "output" string using the "+=" operator.
# Finally, we return the "output" string after all characters with odd index values have been added to it.

# We can test the function by calling it with the example input 'abcdef' and asserting that the result is 'ace', as expected.

# Note that in Python, string indexing starts at 0, so odd indexes correspond to the 1st, 3rd, 5th, etc. characters in the string.

# Here's an example of how to use the function:

input_str = 'abcdef'
result = odd_values_string(input_str)
print(result)  # Output: 'ace'

"""
This code defines a function called odd_values_string that takes a string as input and returns a new string with all characters at odd indexes removed. The function uses a for loop to iterate through each character in the input string. If the index of the current character is odd (i % 2 != 0), the character is added to the output string. Finally, the function returns the output string.

To use the function, you can simply call it with a string as an argument, and it will return the desired result. In the example given, the function is called with the string 'abcdef' and the result is printed, which should be 'ace'.

# Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the code works:

# 1. The function odd_values_string is defined with a single parameter, input_str, which represents the input string.
# 2. Inside the function, an empty string called output is initialized. This string will
