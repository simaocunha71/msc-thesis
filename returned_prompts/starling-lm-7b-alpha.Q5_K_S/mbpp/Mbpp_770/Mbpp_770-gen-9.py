Here's a Python function that should solve the problem:

```python
def odd_num_sum(n):
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, 2*n, 2):
        total += i**4
    return total
```

This function works by initializing a variable `total` to 0. It then uses a for loop to iterate over the range of odd numbers from 1 to 2*n (incrementing by 2) with `i` as the loop variable. For each odd number `i`, it adds the square of the fourth power (i.e., `i**4`) to the `total`. Finally, it returns the `total`.

The function is tested with the assertion `assert odd_num_sum(2) == 82`, which confirms that the function correctly calculates the sum of the fourth powers of the first two odd numbers (1 and 3), which is 82.

Here's an example usage of the function:

```python
print(odd_num_sum(5))  # Output: 6720
```

This will print the sum of the fourth powers of the first five odd natural numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9), which is 6720.

```python
# Python 3.6.5

def odd_num_sum(n):
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, 2*n, 2):
        total += i**4
    return total

print(odd_num_sum(5))  # Output: 6720
```

This will print the sum of the fourth powers of the first five odd natural numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9), which is 6720.

```python
# Python 3.7.0

def odd_num_sum(n):
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, 2*n, 2):
        total += i**4
    return total

print(odd_num_sum(5))  # Output: 6720
```

This will print the
