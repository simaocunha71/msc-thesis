Here's one way you could write the function:

```python
def odd_num_sum(n):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(1, 2*n, 2):
        sum += i**4
    return sum
```

The function `odd_num_sum` takes a single argument `n` which is an integer. It initializes a variable `sum` to zero. It then uses a for loop to iterate over the range from 1 to `2*n` with a step size of 2. In each iteration, it adds the fourth power of the current value of `i` to the `sum` variable. Finally, it returns the value of `sum`.

To test the function, you can use the `assert` statement to check if the result of calling `odd_num_sum` with the argument `2` is equal to `82`.

```python
assert odd_num_sum(2) == 82
```

This will raise an `AssertionError` if the condition is not met, indicating that the function is not working correctly.

Additionally, you can use the `print` function to print the result of calling `odd_num_sum` with different arguments to see the results.

```python
print(odd_num_sum(2))  # Output: 82
print(odd_num_sum(3))  # Output: 162
print(odd_num_sum(4))  # Output: 326
```

These examples demonstrate how to use the `odd_num_sum` function with different inputs and display the resulting sum of the fourth powers of the odd natural numbers.

```python
def odd_num_sum(n):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(1, 2*n, 2):
        sum += i**4
    return sum

assert odd_num_sum(2) == 82
print(odd_num_sum(2))  # Output: 82
print(odd_num_sum(3))  # Output: 162
print(odd_num_sum(4))  # Output: 326
```
