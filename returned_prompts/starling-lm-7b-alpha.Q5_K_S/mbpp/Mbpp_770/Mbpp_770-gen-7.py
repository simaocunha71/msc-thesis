Here's a Python function to find the sum of the fourth power of the first n odd natural numbers:

```python
def odd_num_sum(n):
    # Initialize result
    result = 0

    # Traverse through all odd numbers
    # from 1 to n and add their 4th power
    # to the result
    for i in range(1, 2*n + 1, 2):
        result += i**4

    return result
```

You can use the `assert` statement to verify the function's correctness by checking if the result of `odd_num_sum(2)` is equal to `82`.

```python
assert odd_num_sum(2) == 82
```

This assertion will pass if the function returns the correct result, and fail otherwise.

```python
odd_num_sum(2)
```

The function will return `82` as the sum of the fourth power of the first two odd natural numbers (1 and 3).

```python
odd_num_sum(3)
```

The function will return `230` as the sum of the fourth power of the first three odd natural numbers (1, 3, and 5).

You can use this function to find the sum of the fourth power of any range of odd natural numbers by providing the appropriate value for the `n` parameter.

```python
odd_num_sum(5)
```

The function will return `682` as the sum of the fourth power of the first five odd natural numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, and 9).

```python
odd_num_sum(7)
```

The function will return `1340` as the sum of the fourth power of the first seven odd natural numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13).

```python
odd_num_sum(9)
```

The function will return `2068` as the sum of the fourth power of the first nine odd natural numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9,
