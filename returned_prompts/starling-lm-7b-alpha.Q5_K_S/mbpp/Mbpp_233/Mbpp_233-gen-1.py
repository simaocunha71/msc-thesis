Here's one possible solution:

```python
import math

def lateralsuface_cylinder(r,h):
    return (2*math.pi*r*h)
```

This function takes in a radius (r) and a height (h) as arguments, and returns the lateral surface area of the cylinder. The lateral surface area of a cylinder is calculated by multiplying the circumference of the base (2Ï€r) by the height (h). The function uses the math.pi constant from the math module to ensure accurate calculation of the circumference.

The assert statement at the end of the code checks if the function returns the correct result for a specific input (r=10, h=5). The math.isclose() function is used to compare the function's result with the expected result (314.15), allowing for a relative tolerance of 0.001. This ensures that the result is within the desired level of accuracy.
```

```python
import math

def lateralsuface_cylinder(r,h):
    return (2*math.pi*r*h)

assert math.isclose(lateralsuface_cylinder(10,5), 314.15000000000003, rel_tol=0.001)
```

This code will pass the assert statement, indicating that the function correctly calculates the lateral surface area of a cylinder within the desired level of accuracy.
