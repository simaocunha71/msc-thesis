Here is a solution using Python's math library:

def lateralsuface_cylinder(r,h):
    """
    Find the lateral surface area of a cylinder
    Args:
        r: The radius of the cylinder
        h: The height of the cylinder
    Returns:
        The lateral surface area of the cylinder
    """
    return 2 * 3.141592653589793 * r * h


The above function will pass the assertion

    return 2 * 3.141592653589793 * r * h


# Testing the function
import math

assert math.isclose(lateralsuface_cylinder(10,5), 314.15000000000003, rel_tol=0.001)
```
In this solution, the function `lateralsuface_cylinder` takes the radius (`r`) and height (`h`) of a cylinder as input. It then calculates the lateral surface area of the cylinder using the formula `2 * 3.141592653589793 * r * h`. The function returns the calculated lateral surface area.

To test the function, the `math.isclose` function is used to compare the output of `lateralsuface_cylinder(10,5)` with the expected result of `314.15000000000003`. The `rel_tol` parameter is set to `0.001` to allow for a relative tolerance in the comparison.

The assertion will pass if the calculated lateral surface area is within the specified relative tolerance of the expected result.

Overall, this solution provides a way to
