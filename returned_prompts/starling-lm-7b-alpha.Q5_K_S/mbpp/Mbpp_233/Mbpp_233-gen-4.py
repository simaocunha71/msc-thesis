Here's how you can do it:

1. Define a function `lateralsuface_cylinder` that takes two parameters, `r` and `h`. These are the radius and height of the cylinder, respectively.
2. In the function body, calculate the lateral surface area of the cylinder using the formula: `2 * pi * r * h`.
3. Return the calculated surface area.
4. Outside the function, use the `math.isclose` function to check if the result of calling `lateralsuface_cylinder(10,5)` is approximately equal to `314.15000000000003`, with a relative tolerance of `0.001`. The `math.isclose` function checks if two numbers are approximately equal within a certain tolerance.
5. If the result is approximately equal, the test will pass. Otherwise, it will fail.

Here's the code:

```python
import math

def lateralsuface_cylinder(r, h):
    return 2 * math.pi * r * h

assert math.isclose(lateralsuface_cylinder(10,5), 314.15000000000003, rel_tol=0.001)
```

In this code, we are using the `math.pi` constant to calculate the value of pi, and the `math.isclose` function to check if the result of the function is approximately equal to the expected value, within a relative tolerance of `0.001`.
