# Here's my Python code:
# It defines a function called sample_nam that takes in a list of names as input. It initializes a variable called total_length to 0. Then, it loops through each name in the input list. For each name, it checks if the first letter is uppercase using the isupper() method. If it is, it adds the length of the name to the total_length variable. Finally, it returns the total_length.
# The provided assert statement asserts that when the sample_nam function is called with the list ['sally', 'Dylan', 'rebecca', 'Diana', 'Joanne', 'keith'], it should return 16. The test_sample_nam function is called to test this assertion.
