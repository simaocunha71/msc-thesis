"""
In the Newman-Conway sequence, each number is the sum of the previous two numbers, starting with 0 and 2.

For example, the first few terms of the sequence are:

0, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, 44, ...

Write a function that takes a number `n` and returns the `n`th term in the Newman-Conway sequence.

You can assume that `0 <= n` and that `n` is an integer.
