Here's a solution to your problem:

We can solve this problem using recursion.

The first two terms of the sequence are known (2 and 3), so we can use recursion to calculate the other terms.

We start by defining a function called sequence, which takes an integer as input (n). This function returns the nth term in the sequence.

Inside the function, we have a base case that checks if n is equal to 0. If it is, we return 2 because the first term of the sequence is 2.

Next, we have another base case that checks if n is equal to 1. If it is, we return 3 because the second term of the sequence is 3.

If neither of the base cases is true, we recursively call the sequence function with the arguments n-1 and n-2. This means that we are calculating the (n-1)th term and the (n-2)th term. We then add these two terms together and return the result.

To test the function, we use the assert statement to check if the function correctly calculates the 10th term in the sequence. We expect the result to be 6, and if it is, the assertion passes and the test is successful.

I hope this helps you understand how to solve the problem! Let me know if you have any more questions.
