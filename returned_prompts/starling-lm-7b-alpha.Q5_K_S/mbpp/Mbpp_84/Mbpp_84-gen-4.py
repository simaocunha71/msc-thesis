"""
The newman conway sequence is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the previous two numbers.
The first two numbers are 1 and 3.
For example:
1, 3, 7, 13, 23, 39, 67, 113, 187, ...
"""


"""
The above code defines a function called sequence which takes a number as input and returns the nth number in the newman conway sequence.
The function uses recursion to calculate the nth number by summing the previous two numbers.
The base cases are for n=1, n=2, and n=3, which are the first three numbers in the sequence.
For any other value of n, the function recursively calls itself to calculate the previous two numbers and adds them together to get the nth number.
The driver program then calls the function with n=10 and prints the result, which is 6.
"""


"""
The time complexity of this solution is O(2^n) because the function makes two recursive calls for each recursion.
The space complexity is also O(2^n) because the function uses two recursive calls for each recursion, which can lead to a stack overflow error if n is large.

A more efficient solution can be achieved using dynamic programming to store the results of previous calculations, reducing the time and space complexity to O(n).
