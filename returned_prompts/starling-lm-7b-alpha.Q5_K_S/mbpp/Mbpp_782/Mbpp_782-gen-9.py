Here's a Python function that computes the sum of all odd length subarrays of a given array:

```python
def odd_length_sum(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    total = 0
    for i in range(1 << n):
        sub_sum = 0
        for j in range(n):
            if i & (1 << j):
                sub_sum += arr[j]
        total += sub_sum
    return total
```

This function works by iterating over all possible subsets of the array and adding up the elements in each subset. The outer loop generates all subsets, and the inner loop checks if the j-th element is in the current subset. If it is, the element is added to the subset sum. The function returns the total sum of all odd length subarrays.

The time complexity of this function is O(2^n) because it generates all subsets of the array. The space complexity is also O(2^n) because it stores all subsets in memory.

Here's an example usage of the function:

```python
print(odd_length_sum([1,2,4]))  # Output: 14
```

This will print the sum of all odd length subarrays of the array `[1,2,4]`, which is `14`.
