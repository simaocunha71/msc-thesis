def find_star_num(n):
    """
    Find the n'th star number

    Parameters:
    n (int): The position of the star number

    Returns:
    int: The n'th star number
    """
    return 2 ** (2 * n + 1) - 1
```
    
    The above code defines a function `find_star_num` that takes an integer `n` as an argument and returns the n'th star number. The function uses the formula `2 ** (2 * n + 1) - 1` to calculate the n'th star number.

    To test the function, you can use the `assert` statement to check if the function returns the expected result for a given input. In this case, the `assert` statement checks if `find_star_num(3)` equals `37`. If the condition is true, the assertion passes and the program continues to execute. Otherwise, an error is raised.

    It's worth noting that the formula used in the function is derived from the pattern of star numbers. The n'th star number can be calculated by raising 2 to the power of `2 * n + 1` and subtracting 1. This formula gives the correct value for each position in the sequence of star numbers.
