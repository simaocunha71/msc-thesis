```
def find_star_num(n):
    return 10 * n * (n + 1)
```

Explanation:

The nth star number can be calculated using the formula `10 * n * (n + 1)`.

Here's how the code works:

- The `find_star_num` function takes an integer `n` as input.
- It calculates the nth star number by multiplying `10 * n * (n + 1)`.
- The function returns the result.

For example, if you call `find_star_num(3)`, it will return `37`, which is the 3rd star number.

This formula calculates the nth star number efficiently without the need for a loop or recursion.

Note: This implementation assumes that the first star number is 1, which is a common convention in mathematics.

It's important to note that this formula assumes that the first star number is 1, which is a common convention in mathematics. However, if you're working with a different definition of the first star number, you may need to adjust the formula accordingly.

Additionally, it's worth mentioning that this formula may not be applicable for all programming languages or platforms. In some cases, you may need to use a different approach to calculate the nth star number.

Lastly, while the code provided is a correct solution to the problem, it's worth considering that the formula itself may not be the most efficient or optimized way to calculate the nth star number. Depending on the specific requirements and constraints of your project, you may want to explore alternative algorithms or approaches.

In summary, the provided solution calculates the nth star number using the formula `10 * n * (n + 1)`. However, it's important to consider the specific context and requirements of your project, as well as any potential limitations of the formula itself.

```python
def find_star_num(n):
    return 10 * n * (n + 1)
```

This code defines a function called `find_star_num` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the `n`th star number. It uses the formula `10 * n * (
