"""
To solve this, you can use the following steps:

1. Initialize a variable, n, with the value of the input number.
2. Create a variable, sum, and initialize it with the value of 0. This variable will store the sum of all star numbers up to the given input number.
3. Iterate through all numbers from 1 to the input number, n.
4. For each number, calculate the sum of its digits.
5. Add the calculated sum to the variable, sum.
6. After the iteration is finished, return the value of the variable, sum.
7. This will give you the n'th star number.
"""

Here's a Python function that implements these steps:

```python
def find_star_num(n):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        digits_sum = sum(int(j) for j in str(i))
        sum += digits_sum
    return sum
```

You can use the `assert` statement to check if the function is correct:

```python
assert find_star_num(3) == 37
```

The assert statement checks if the function `find_star_num` with the input `3` returns the expected output `37`. If the condition is true, the assert statement does nothing. If the condition is false, an `AssertionError` is raised, indicating that there is an error in the code.

By using the `assert` statement, you can ensure that the function `find_star_num` is correctly calculating the n'th star number.

```python
def find_star_num(n):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        digits_sum = sum(int(j) for j in str(i))
        sum += digits_sum
    return sum

assert find_star_num(3) == 37
```

This code defines the function `find_star_num` that finds the n'th star number and uses the `assert` statement to verify if the function is correct.

The `find_star_num` function iterates through all numbers from 1 to the
