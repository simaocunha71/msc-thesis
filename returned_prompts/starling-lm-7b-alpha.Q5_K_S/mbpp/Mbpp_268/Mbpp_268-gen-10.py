"""
This function works by utilizing the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers,
which is the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.
The sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula:

a + (n - 1)d

where a is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, the first term (a) is 1, the common difference (d) is 1, and the number of terms (n) is given by the input parameter n.

By plugging in these values into the formula, we get the sum of the first n natural numbers, which is equal to the n'th star number.
"""

"""
To explain the code further, the function first checks if the input value of n is less than 0. If it is, the function returns 0, indicating that there are no star numbers in this case.

If the input value of n is not less than 0, the function proceeds to calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers using the formula mentioned above. It does this by multiplying n by (n + 1) and then dividing the result by 2. This is equivalent to the sum of an arithmetic series with the given values of a and d.

Finally, the function returns the calculated sum, which is the n'th star number.
"""

"""
To verify the correctness of the function, a test case is provided. The function is called with the input value of 3, and the result is compared to the expected output of 37. The assertion passes if the calculated sum is equal to the expected output, indicating that the function correctly finds the n'th star number.
