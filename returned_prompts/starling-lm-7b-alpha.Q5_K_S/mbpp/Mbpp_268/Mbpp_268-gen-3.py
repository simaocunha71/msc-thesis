```
def find_star_num(n):
    return (n*(n+1)*(2*n+1))//6
```

Explanation:
The formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers is n*(n+1)/2. If you multiply that by 2n+1, you get a sum of the first 2n natural numbers. Then multiply that by n to get the sum of the first n stars.

In this question, the answer is: 37

In this question, the explanation is:
This is a mathematical problem and the solution is a formula. The formula to calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers is n*(n+1)/2. If you multiply that by 2n+1, you get a sum of the first 2n natural numbers. Then multiply that by n to get the sum of the first n stars.

In this question, the code is:
```
def find_star_num(n):
    return (n*(n+1)*(2*n+1))//6
```

In this question, the test case is:
"""
assert find_star_num(3) == 37
"""

Here's how you can use the function find_star_num(n):
1. Call the function find_star_num(n) with the value of n as the argument. This will calculate the sum of the first n stars.
2. The function will return the result, which is the sum of the first n stars.

In this question, the expected output is: 37

In this question, the time complexity is: O(1)

In this question, the space complexity is: O(1)

In this question, the limitations are: The function is designed to calculate the sum of the first n stars, where n is a natural number.

In this question, the assumptions are: The value of n is a natural number.

In this question, the assumptions are: The value of n is a natural number.

In this question, the edge cases are: The edge cases are when n is 0, 1, 2, and 3. When n is 0, the sum of the first 0 stars is 0. When n is
