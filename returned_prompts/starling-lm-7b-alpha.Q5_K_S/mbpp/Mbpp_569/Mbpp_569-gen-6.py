Explanation:
The function `sort_sublists` takes a single parameter, `input_list`, which is a list of lists. It iterates through each sublist in `input_list`, and sorts them in-place using the `sort` method. The `sort` method sorts the sublist in ascending order. Finally, the function returns the sorted `input_list`.

To test the function, you can use the `assert` statement to check if the output of `sort_sublists` matches the expected result. In this case, the expected result is `[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]`. 

If the `sort_sublists` function is implemented correctly, running the code will not raise any exceptions and the assertion will pass, indicating that the function is working as expected.

Here's an example of how you can use the `sort_sublists` function:
```python
input_list = [['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['white', 'black', 'orange']]
output = sort_sublists(input_list)
print(output)  # Output: [['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]
```
In this example, the `sort_sublists` function is called with the `input_list` as an argument. The sorted sublists are then printed to the console.

The `sort_sublists` function can be used to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists, ensuring that the sublists are sorted in ascending order.

Note: The `sort` method sorts the sublist in-place, meaning that the changes are applied directly to the original sublist rather than creating a new sorted sublist.

As a result, the `sort_sublists` function can be considered an in-place sorting function for sublists in a given
