In this problem, we need to sort the sublists of a given list of lists. Here's how we can do it in Python:

1. Define a function `sort_sublists` that takes the list of lists as an argument.
2. Iterate through each sublist in the list of lists using a `for` loop. For each sublist, we need to sort it.
3. Inside the loop, use the built-in `sort()` function to sort the sublist. This function modifies the sublist in-place, so we don't need to assign the sorted sublist back to the original sublist variable.
4. After sorting all the sublists, return the list of lists.
5. To test the function, you can use the `assert` statement to compare the expected output with the actual output of the function. If the outputs match, the assertion is true and the test passes. Otherwise, the assertion fails and an error message is displayed.

In the provided solution, the `sort_sublists` function sorts the sublists in lexicographical order (alphabetical order). If you want to sort the sublists in a different order, you can pass a custom sorting function as an argument to the `sort()` function. For example, to sort the sublists in reverse lexicographical order, you can use `sublist.sort(reverse=True)`.

It's important to note that the `sort_sublists` function modifies the original list of lists in-place. If you don't want to modify the original list, you can make a copy of the list of lists before passing it to the function
