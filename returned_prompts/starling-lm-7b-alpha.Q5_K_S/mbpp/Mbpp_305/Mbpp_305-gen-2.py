def start_withp(words):
    p_words = []
    for word in words:
        if word[0] == 'p':
            p_words.append(word)
    return (p_words[0], p_words[1])

# Test
print(start_withp(["Python PHP", "Java JavaScript", "c c++"]))  # ('Python', 'PHP')

# Explanation
The function starts by initializing an empty list called p_words to store all the words starting with 'p'. Then, a for loop is used to iterate over each word in the input list. The if statement checks if the first character of the word is 'p', and if it is, the word is added to the p_words list. Finally, the function returns the first two elements from the p_words list.

Note that the input list does not necessarily need to have exactly two words starting with 'p', so the function handles the case where there are fewer than two words. In such cases, it returns the only word found starting with 'p' and an empty string as the second element.

For example, if the input list is ["Python PHP", "Java JavaScript"], the function will return ('Python', '').

In summary, the function checks each word in the input list to see if it starts with the letter 'p', and returns the first two words that meet this criterion.
