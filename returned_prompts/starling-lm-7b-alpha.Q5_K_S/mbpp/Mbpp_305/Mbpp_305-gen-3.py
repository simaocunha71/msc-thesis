"""
Explanation:
The function start_withp takes in a list of words as an argument. It creates a new list, p_words, using a list comprehension to filter out the words in the input list that start with the letter 'p'. If there are no words starting with 'p' in the list, the function returns None. Otherwise, it returns the first two words starting with 'p' from the p_words list.
