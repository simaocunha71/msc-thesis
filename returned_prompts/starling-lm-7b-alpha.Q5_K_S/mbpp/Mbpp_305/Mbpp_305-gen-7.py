"""
The function `start_withp` takes a list of words and returns two of them starting with the letter 'p'.

The function uses a for loop to iterate over the words in the list. For each word, it checks if the first letter is 'p'. If it is, the word is added to the list `pwords`. After the loop, the function checks if `pwords` is empty. If it is, that means no words started with 'p', so the function returns `None`. Otherwise, it returns the first two words from `pwords`.

The other solution uses a list comprehension to create a new list of words starting with 'p'. It then uses slicing to get the first two words from the new list.

The function is tested with several examples to ensure it works correctly.
