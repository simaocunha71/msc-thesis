The time complexity of the above function is O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because the split() method has a linear time complexity based on the number of characters in the string.

Here's a breakdown of the time complexity of each step of the function:

1. The split() method is called on the string s, which has a time complexity of O(n). This is because the split() method has to iterate through each character in the string to find the spaces and split the string into individual words.

2. The list returned by the split() method is stored in a variable, which has a constant time complexity of O(1).

3. The function then returns the list, which also has a constant time complexity of O(1).

Therefore, the overall time complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the length of the string.
