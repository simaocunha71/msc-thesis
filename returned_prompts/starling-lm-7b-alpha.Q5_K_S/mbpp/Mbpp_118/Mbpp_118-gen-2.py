"""
Write a function to convert a string to a list of strings split on the space character.

Explanation:
To convert a string to a list of strings split on the space character, we can use the built-in split() method in Python. The split() method splits a string into a list where each word is a separate element. The default separator used by the split() method is the space character (" "). Therefore, by using the split() method on a string, we can easily convert the string to a list of strings split on the space character.

The provided code defines a function called string_to_list that takes a string as input and uses the split() method to convert the string to a list of strings. The assert statement in the test_string_to_list() function checks if the function returns the expected result for the given input "python programming". The expected result is a list containing two elements: "python" and "programming". 

In the Python 3.6 version of the code, the print() function is used to display the result of the test_string_to_list() function. This allows us to verify if the function is working correctly by checking if the output matches the expected result. 

By running the code, we can confirm that the string_to_list() function correctly converts a string to a list of strings split on the space character, as the assert statement passes and the expected result is printed to the console.
