def string_to_list(s):
    return s.split(" ")

# Testing
print(string_to_list("python programming"))


# Explanation
The function `string_to_list` takes in a string `s` as an argument and uses the `split` method to split the string into a list of strings based on the space character. The `split` method splits the string at each occurrence of the specified separator (in this case, the space character) and returns a list of substrings. Finally, the function returns the resulting list of strings.

In the provided test case, the string "python programming" is passed to the `string_to_list` function. The function splits the string at each space character and returns a list containing two elements: 'python' and 'programming'. The assertion `assert string_to_list("python programming")==['python','programming']` checks if the returned list is equal to `['python', 'programming']` as expected.

Overall, the function successfully converts a string to a list of strings split on the space character, and the provided test case verifies the correctness of the implementation.
