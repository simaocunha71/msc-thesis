def is_not_prime(num):
    for i in range(2, num):
        if (num % i) == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

This function `is_not_prime` takes a number as an input and checks if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. If it is divisible by any other number, the function returns False, indicating that the number is not a prime number. If the function doesn't return False for any number other than 1 and itself, it means the number is a prime number and the function returns True.

The `assert` statement in Python is used for debugging and testing purposes. In this case, it is used to test the `is_not_prime` function and ensure that it correctly identifies non-prime numbers. The `assert` statement checks if the expected result (False) is equal to the actual result of the function (`is_not_prime(2)`). If the two values are not equal, an AssertionError is raised.

By using the `assert` statement and testing the function with different inputs, you can ensure that the function is working correctly and accurately identifying non-prime numbers.

```python
def is_not_prime(num):
    for i in range(2, num):
        if (num % i) == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

The function `is_not_prime` works by iterating through all numbers from 2 to `num-1` and checking if `num` is divisible by any of them. If `num` is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself, it means that `num` is not a prime number. In that case, the function returns False. If the function doesn't return False for any number other than 1 and itself, it means that `num` is a prime number, and the function returns True.

This algorithm is efficient for checking if a number is prime because it only needs to check up to `num-1` numbers. If `num` is a composite number, it will be divisible by some number in this range, and the function can return False early. If `num` is a prime number, the function will return True after checking all the numbers in the range.
