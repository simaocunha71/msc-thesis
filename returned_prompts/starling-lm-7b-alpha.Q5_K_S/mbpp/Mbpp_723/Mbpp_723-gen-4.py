"""
The input is defined as two lists of the same length. Write a function to count indices where the lists have the same values.

Explanation:
The function 'count_same_pair' takes two lists as input and initializes a counter to keep track of the number of indices where the lists have the same values. It then iterates over the indices of the lists using a for loop and checks if the values at the corresponding indices in both lists are equal. If they are equal, the counter is incremented. Finally, the function returns the value of the counter.

In the provided example, the function is called with the lists [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] and [2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 6, 7, 9]. The function compares the values at each index in the lists and finds that the values at indices 0, 1, 2, and 5 are the same (2, 2, 3, and 6). Therefore, the function returns 4, indicating that there are 4 indices where the lists have the same values.
