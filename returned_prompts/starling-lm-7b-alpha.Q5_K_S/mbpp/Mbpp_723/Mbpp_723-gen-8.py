"""
The above code works by first using the zip function to combine the two input lists into a single list of tuples. The set function is then used to remove duplicate tuples, and the intersection function is used to find the common elements between the two lists. The len function is used to count the number of common elements and return the result.

This approach is efficient and concise, and can handle lists of any length.

# Another way to solve this problem is by using the itertools.izip function, which is a more memory-friendly alternative to the zip function. Here is an example of how to use it:

from itertools import izip
