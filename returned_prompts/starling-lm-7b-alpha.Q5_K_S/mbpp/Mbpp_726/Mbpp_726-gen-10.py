Explanation:
The function `multiply_elements` takes a tuple of numbers as input and returns a tuple of length N, where the i-th element of the tuple is equal to `t_i * t_{i+1}`. 

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. Define a function `multiply_elements` that takes a tuple `t` as input.
2. Get the length of the input tuple `t` and assign it to the variable `N`.
3. Create an empty list `result` to store the multiplied elements.
4. Use a list comprehension to iterate over the range of `N - 1` (i.e., from 0 to `N - 2`). For each index `i`, multiply the elements at indices `i` and `i + 1` of the input tuple `t` and append the result to the `result` list.
5. Convert the `result` list to a tuple and return it.
6. The `assert` statement at the end of the code is used to verify the correctness of the function. It checks if the output of `multiply_elements` with the input `(1, 5, 7, 8, 10)` is equal to the expected output `(5, 35, 56, 80)`. If the assertion fails, an error message will be raised.

By following these steps, the function `multiply_elements` will take a tuple of numbers and return a tuple with the desired multiplied elements.

Here are some additional test cases to validate the function:

```python
print(multiply_elements((1, 2, 3)))  # Output: (2, 6)
print(multiply_elements((1, 2, 3, 4)))  # Output: (2, 6, 12)
print(multiply_elements((1, 2, 3, 4, 5)))  # Output: (
