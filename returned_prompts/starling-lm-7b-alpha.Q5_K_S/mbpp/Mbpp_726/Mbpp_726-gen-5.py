def multiply_elements(t):

    for i in range(len(t)-1):
        r.append(t[i]*t[i+1])
    return tuple(r)
```

Explanation:
The function multiply_elements takes a tuple of numbers as input and initializes an empty list r. It then iterates over the range of the length of the input tuple minus one, and for each iteration, it appends the product of the current element and the next element to the list r. Finally, it returns the tuple representation of the list r, which has the desired length N and each element equal to t_i * t_{i+1}. The assert statement tests the function with the example input (1, 5, 7, 8, 10) and the expected output (5, 35, 56, 80), confirming that the function correctly multiplies the elements of the input tuple.

Note: The tuple(r) function is used to convert the list r back into a tuple before returning it, as the function is required to return a tuple.

Also note that the function assumes that the input tuple has a length greater than or equal to 2, as there is no check for this condition. If the input tuple has a length of 1 or less, the function will raise an IndexError when trying to access t[i+1].

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the function:

1. Define a function called multiply_elements that takes a single input parameter called t, which is a tuple of numbers.
2. Initialize an empty list called r.
3. Use a for loop to iterate over the range of the length of the input tuple minus one. This will give us the indices of the elements we want to multiply.
4. For each iteration, append the product of the current element (t[i]) and the next element (t[i+1]) to the list r.
5. After the loop is finished, use the tuple() function to convert the list r back into a tuple and return it.
6. Test the function with the example input (1, 5, 7, 8, 10) and the expected output (5, 35, 56, 8
