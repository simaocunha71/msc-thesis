"""
The problem asks you to multiply the elements of a tuple, but the tuple should be of length N+1. In this case, the tuple is of length 5, which is N+1. You need to multiply each element of the tuple with the next element of the tuple.

Here's a possible implementation:

```python
def multiply_elements(t):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(t) - 1):
        result.append(t[i] * t[i+1])
    return tuple(result)
```

In the function `multiply_elements`, we initialize an empty list `result` to store the multiplied values. We then iterate through the tuple `t` using a for loop, starting from index 0 and ending at index `len(t) - 1`. For each iteration, we multiply the current element `t[i]` with the next element `t[i+1]`, and append the result to the `result` list.

Finally, we convert the `result` list into a tuple using the `tuple()` function and return it.

You can test the function with the given example:

```python
assert multiply_elements((1, 5, 7, 8, 10)) == (5, 35, 56, 80)
```

This assertion checks if the function `multiply_elements` returns the correct result for the input tuple (1, 5, 7, 8, 10), which is (5, 35, 56, 80). If the assertion passes, it means that the function is working correctly.
