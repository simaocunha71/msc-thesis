```
def multiply_elements(t):
    return tuple([t[i]*t[i+1] for i in range(len(t)-1)])
```

Explanation:
The function `multiply_elements` takes a tuple of numbers `t` as input. It uses a list comprehension to create a new tuple of length `N` where the `i`-th element of the tuple is equal to `t_i * t_{i+1}` for all `i` from `0` to `N-1`. The `range(len(t)-1)` ensures that the `i+1` index is valid, as Python uses zero-based indexing. The function then returns the newly created tuple.

In the provided example, `multiply_elements((1, 5, 7, 8, 10))` is called, which will multiply the elements `(1, 5)`, `(5, 7)`, `(7, 8)`, and `(8, 10)`. The function will return the tuple `(5, 35, 56, 80)`.

Note:
The function assumes that the input tuple `t` has a length of `N+1`, where `N` is a positive integer. It is important to ensure that the length of the input tuple matches the expected length to avoid any errors or unexpected results.

Additionally, the function does not include the last element of the input tuple in the returned tuple, as it does not have a corresponding element to multiply with.

If you need to include the last element of the input tuple, you can modify the function as follows:

```python
def multiply_elements(t):
    return tuple([t[i]*t[i+1] for i in range(len(t)-1)]) + (t[-1],)
```

This modified version of the function will include the last element of the input tuple by appending it to the end of the returned tuple using the `+` operator.

Both versions of the function can be used depending on your specific requirements.

Lastly, it's important to note that the `tuple` type in Python is immutable, meaning that once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be
