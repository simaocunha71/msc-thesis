```
def multiply_elements(t_1,...,t_{N+1}):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(t_1)-1):
        result.append(t_i * t_{i+1})
    return tuple(result)
```

Here's a more detailed explanation of the steps to follow:

1. Define the function `multiply_elements` that takes a tuple as input.
2. Create an empty list called `result` to store the multiplied elements.
3. Use a for loop to iterate through the indices of the tuple from 0 to `len(t_1)-1`. This will give you access to each pair of elements.
4. For each pair of elements, multiply them together and append the result to the `result` list.
5. After the loop is finished, convert the `result` list to a tuple using the `tuple()` function.
6. Return the resulting tuple.

For example, if the input tuple is `(1, 5, 7, 8, 10)`, the function will multiply the first and second elements (`1 * 5 = 5`), the second and third elements (`5 * 7 = 35`), the third and fourth elements (`7 * 8 = 56`), and the fourth and fifth elements (`8 * 10 = 80`). The function will then return the tuple `(5, 35, 56, 80)`.

In the provided code example, the `multiply_elements` function is defined with a single parameter `t_1,...,t_{N+1}` to represent the input tuple. The for loop iterates through the indices of the tuple using the `range()` function and multiplies each pair of elements together. The results are appended to the `result` list, which is then converted to a tuple using the `tuple()` function. Finally, the resulting tuple is returned as the output of the function.

You can test the function by calling it with a tuple of numbers, like `multiply_elements((1, 5, 7, 8, 10))`, and it should return the expected result `(5, 35, 56, 8
