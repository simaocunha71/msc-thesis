Here are some tips to improve your question:

1. It's great that you provided a sample test case, but you should also provide the expected output of the function for that test case. That way, it's easier to verify if the function is working correctly.

2. The function name `polar_rect` is a bit unclear. It would be better to use a name that describes what the function does, such as `convert_polar_to_rectangular` or `polar_to_rectangular`.

3. You should include some documentation in your code, such as comments explaining what the function does and how to use it. This will make it easier for others to understand your code and use it correctly.

4. It's a good practice to include unit tests in your code. Unit tests are small test cases that verify if a function is working correctly. In this case, you could write a unit test to check if the function correctly converts polar coordinates to rectangular coordinates. This will help ensure that your function is working correctly and will help prevent bugs in your code.

5. Finally, it's important to use proper indentation in your Python code. Python uses indentation to determine the structure of the code, and incorrect indentation can lead to syntax errors. Make sure to use four spaces for each level of indentation, and avoid mixing tabs and spaces in your code.

I hope these tips help you improve your question and make your code more understandable and maintainable. Good luck with your coding journey!
