# This code defines a function called find_Average_Of_Cube that takes an integer argument n.
# Inside the function, a variable sum is initialized to 0. Then, a for loop iterates from 1 to n (inclusive).
# On each iteration, the cube of the current number i is added to the sum.
# After the loop, the average of the cubes is calculated by dividing the sum by n, and the result is returned.
# The assert statement checks that the function correctly calculates the average of the cubes of the first two natural numbers, which should be 4.5.
# The function can be called with any positive integer argument to find the average of the cubes of the first n natural numbers.

# Here's an example of how to use the function:

n = 5
result = find_Average_Of_Cube(n)
print(result)  # Output: 9.5

# In this example, the function is called with the argument 5, so it calculates the average of the cubes of the first 5 natural numbers, which is 9.5. The result is printed to the console.
