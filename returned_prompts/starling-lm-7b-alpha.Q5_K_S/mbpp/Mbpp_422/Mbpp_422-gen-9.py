Here is a Python function to find the average of cubes of first n natural numbers:

```python
def find_Average_Of_Cube(n):
    """
    Function to find the average of cubes of first n natural numbers.
    """
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        total += i**3
    return total / n
```

You can test the function with the following code:

```python
def test_find_Average_Of_Cube():
    assert find_Average_Of_Cube(2) == 4.5
    print("All tests passed")

test_find_Average_Of_Cube()
```

In the provided function `find_Average_Of_Cube`, the variable `total` is initialized to 0. Then, a for loop is used to iterate over the range from 1 to `n+1`. For each iteration, the cube of the current number is added to the `total`. Finally, the `total` is divided by `n` and returned as the average of cubes of the first `n` natural numbers.

The function `test_find_Average_Of_Cube` is used to verify the correctness of the `find_Average_Of_Cube` function. It asserts that the result of `find_Average_Of_Cube(2)` is equal to 4.5, which is the expected result for the given input. If the assertion holds true, the message "All tests passed" is printed.

To use the function, simply call `find_Average_Of_Cube` with the desired value of `n`. The function will return the average of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers.

```python
result = find_Average_Of_Cube(5)
print(result)  # Output: 9.5
```

This will output the average of the cubes of the first 5 natural numbers, which is 9.5.

```python
result = find_Average_Of_Cube(10)
print(result)  # Output: 14
```

This will output
