Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. Initialize an empty dictionary d.
2. Iterate through all elements of the original list. For each element, perform the following steps:
    a. Convert the list to a tuple.
    b. If the tuple is already present in the dictionary d, increment its value by 1. Otherwise, add the tuple to the dictionary with the value of 1.
3. Return the dictionary d.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n*m) because each operation (conversion to tuple and dictionary lookup/insertion) takes constant time. The space complexity is O(n) because the size of the dictionary can be at most equal to the size of the original list.

# Here is the Python3 code that you can execute directly:
print(unique_sublists([[1, 3], [5, 7], [1, 3], [13, 15, 17], [5, 7], [9, 11]]))

"""
This will output:

{(1, 3): 2, (5, 7): 2, (13, 15, 17): 1, (9, 11): 1}
