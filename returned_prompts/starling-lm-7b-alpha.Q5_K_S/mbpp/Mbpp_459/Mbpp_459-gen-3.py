"""
In this code, we define a function remove_uppercase that takes a string s as input. Inside the function, we use a list comprehension to create a new string by iterating over each character in the input string. For each character, we use the islower() method to check if the character is lowercase. If it is, we include it in the new string; otherwise, we skip it. Finally, we use the join() method to concatenate all the characters in the new string into a single string and return it as the result.

To test the function, we call it with the input string 'cAstyoUrFavoRitETVshoWs' and assert that the expected output 'cstyoravoitshos' is returned.
