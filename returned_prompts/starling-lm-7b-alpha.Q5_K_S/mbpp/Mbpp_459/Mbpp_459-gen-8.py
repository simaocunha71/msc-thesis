def remove_uppercase(string):

"""
Explanation:
The function remove_uppercase takes a string as input and uses a list comprehension to create a new string that only contains the lowercase characters. It does this by iterating over each character in the input string, checking if it is lowercase using the islower() method, and if it is, appending it to a new string. Finally, the function returns the new string without any uppercase characters.

In the provided example, the input string is "cAstyoUrFavoRitETVshoWs". The function removes the uppercase characters "A", "U", "F", "R", "E", "T", "V", and "W", resulting in the output string "cstyoravoitshos".

"""
In the provided code, the function remove_uppercase is defined to take a string as input. It uses a list comprehension to create a new string that only contains the lowercase characters. The list comprehension iterates over each character in the input string, and checks if it is lowercase using the islower() method. If the character is lowercase, it is added to the new string using the join() method. Finally, the function returns the new string without any uppercase characters.

The assert statement is used to verify that the function is working correctly. It compares the output of the remove_uppercase function with the expected result of "cstyoravoitshos". Since the two strings are equal, the assert statement passes and the code executes successfully.
