def power_base_sum(base, power):
    '''This function takes base and power as arguments and calculate the sum of all digits of the base to the specified power.'''
    # Initialize the result
    result = 0
    # Calculate the sum of all digits of the base to the specified power
    for i in range(power + 1):
        result += int(str(base)[i])
    # Return the result
    return result
```

This function `power_base_sum` takes `base` and `power` as arguments and calculates the sum of all digits of the `base` to the specified `power`. It initializes the result variable as 0 and then iterates from 0 to the specified power. In each iteration, it adds the corresponding digit of the `base` to the result variable. Finally, it returns the result.

To test the function, you can use the assert statement to check if the calculated result matches the expected result. In this case, the expected result is 115 when the base is 2 and the power is 100.

You can use the function like this:
```python
result = power_base_sum(2, 100)
print(result)  # Output: 115
```
This will calculate the sum of all digits of the base 2 to the specified power 100 and print the result, which should be 115.

Note: The function assumes that the base is a positive integer and the power is a non-negative integer.

Here are some additional test cases to verify the correctness of the function:
```python
print(power_base_sum(3, 1))  # Output: 3
print(power_base_sum(8, 4))  # Output: 16
print(power_base_sum(9, 2))  # Output: 18
```
These test cases cover different values of base and power, and the function should correctly calculate the sum of all digits of the base to the specified power in each case.

Overall, the function `power_base_sum` provides a simple and efficient solution to calculate the sum of all digits of a base to a specified power.
