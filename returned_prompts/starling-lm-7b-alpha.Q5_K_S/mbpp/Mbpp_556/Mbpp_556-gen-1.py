Here's one possible solution:

```python
def find_Odd_Pair(nums,target):
    res=0
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i+1,len(nums)):
            if (nums[i]^nums[j])%2 == 1:
                res+=1
    return res
```

You can test this function with the example provided:

```python
print(find_Odd_Pair([5,4,7,2,1],5))  # Outputs: 6
```

This function works by iterating over all pairs of numbers in the list. It uses the bitwise XOR operator `^` to calculate the XOR value of each pair. If the XOR value is odd (i.e., the result of the XOR operation is not divisible by 2), then the pair is counted in the result.

The time complexity of this function is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input list.

Note that the provided assert statement is incorrect, as it is testing the function with a target value of 5, but the function is designed to count pairs with an odd XOR value, not pairs that are equal to a specific target value.

In this solution, the `find_Odd_Pair` function takes two arguments: `nums`, which is the input list of numbers, and `target`, which is the target value. However, the provided assert statement is incorrect because it tests the function with a target value of 5, but the function is designed to count pairs with an odd XOR value, not pairs equal to a specific target value. 

The function uses two nested loops to iterate over all pairs of numbers in the list.
