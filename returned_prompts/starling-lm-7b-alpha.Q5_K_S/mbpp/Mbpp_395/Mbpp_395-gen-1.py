To find the first non-repeated character in a given string, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a dictionary to keep track of character occurrences.
2. Iterate through the string, adding each character to the dictionary and its count.
3. Check if the count of the character is equal to 1. If it is, return the character as the first non-repeated character.
4. If no non-repeated character is found, return None.

Here's a Python function that implements this logic:

```python
def first_non_repeating_character(s):
    char_dict = {}
    for c in s:
        if c in char_dict:
            char_dict[c] += 1
        else:
            char_dict[c] = 1
    for c in s:
        if char_dict[c] == 1:
            return c
    return None
```

You can test the function with the provided assertion:

```python
print(first_non_repeating_character("abcabc"))  # Output: None
```

The function will return None because all characters in the string "abcabc" appear twice, and there is no non-repeated character.

def first_non_repeating_character(s):
    char_dict = {}
    for c in s:
        if c in char_dict:
            char_dict[c] += 1
        else:
            char_dict[c] = 1
    for c in s:
        if char_dict[c] == 1:
            return c
    return None

print(first_non_repeating_character("abcabc"))  # Output: None
```

This function is a good example of using a dictionary to count occurrences of characters in a string. It utilizes the dictionary's ability to store key-value pairs, where the key is the character and the value is the count of occurrences. By iterating through the string and updating the dictionary, we can efficiently identify the first non-repeated character in the string.
