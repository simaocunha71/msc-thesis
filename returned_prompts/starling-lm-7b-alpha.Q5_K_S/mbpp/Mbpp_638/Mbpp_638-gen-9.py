"""
The wind chill index (WCI) is calculated using the formula:

WCI = 13.12 + 0.63 * T - 11.37 * V^0.16 + 0.39 * T * V^0.16

Where T is the temperature in Celsius and V is the wind velocity in km/h.

Here is a function which uses this formula to calculate the wind chill index:

"""

def wind_chill(temperature, velocity):
    return round(13.12 + 0.63 * temperature - 11.37 * (velocity ** 0.16) + 0.39 * temperature * (velocity ** 0.16))

# Testing the function
print(wind_chill(120,35))
