Explanation:

The idea of this code is to maintain a stack of the last seen number that is smaller than the current seen number. When the next number is smaller than the last seen number in the stack, we simply push it to the stack. However, when the next number is larger than the last seen number in the stack, we start popping all the larger numbers from the stack until we find a number that is smaller than the current number. Then we push the current number to the stack.

The purpose of maintaining such a stack is to find the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of the array. In other words, the maximum product can only be formed by the numbers in the stack at the moment when the stack size is the maximum.

The time complexity of this code is O(n) and the space complexity is O(n).

Here is a Python implementation of the code:

```python
def max_product(A):
    n = len(A)
    cur = 0
    max_product = 0
    stack = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        if stack[cur] < A[i]:
            stack[cur + 1] = A[i]
            cur += 1
        else:
            while cur >= 0 and stack[cur] >= A[i]:
                cur -= 1
            stack[cur + 1] = A[i]
            cur += 1
        if cur > max_product:
            max_product = cur
    return stack[max_product]
