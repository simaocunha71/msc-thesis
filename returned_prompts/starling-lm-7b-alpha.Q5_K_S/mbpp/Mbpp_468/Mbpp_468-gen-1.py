Here's a possible solution:

1. Initialize max_product = 1, min_product = 1.
2. For each number n in the array:
    a. If n > min_product, update min_product = n, max_product = max(max_product * n, min_product).
    b. Else, update max_product = max(max_product * n, min_product * n).
3. Return max_product.

def max_product(numbers):
    max_product = 1
    min_product = 1
    for n in numbers:
        if n > min_product:
            min_product = n
            max_product = max(max_product * n, min_product)
        else:
            max_product = max(max_product * n, min_product * n)
    return max_product
```

This solution works because we keep track of the two most recent numbers in the increasing subsequence, and update them as we process each number in the array. The max_product is updated as the product of the current number and the previous min_product (or the previous max_product if the current number is smaller).

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array.

The space complexity is O(1), as we only need to keep track of two variables.

The solution correctly solves the problem because it finds the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence of the array.

Here's an example usage:

```
assert max_product([3, 100, 4, 5, 150, 6]) == 3000
```

This test case confirms that the max_product function correctly calculates the maximum product of an increasing subsequence in the array.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array, because we have to traverse the entire array once.

The space complexity is O(1), as we only need to keep track of two variables, max_product and min_product, which don't depend on the size of the input array.
