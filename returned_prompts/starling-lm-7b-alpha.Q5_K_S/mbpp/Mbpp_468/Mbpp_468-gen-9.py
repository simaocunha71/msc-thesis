Here is a Python solution to find the maximum product of an increasing subsequence:

In the solution, we use two variables, `max_product_sub` and `max_product_suf`, to store the maximum product of the increasing subsequence until the current index and from the current index to the end, respectively.

First, we initialize `max_product_sub` and `max_product_suf` with 1, as there is no increasing subsequence initially. Then, we iterate through the `nums` array and update `max_product_sub` and `max_product_suf` for each element.

For each element, we compare the product of the current element and the maximum product of the increasing subsequence until the previous element with the current element itself. We update `max_product_sub` accordingly.

Next, we iterate through the `nums` array in reverse order and update `max_product_suf` for each element. Again, we compare the product of the current element and the maximum product of the increasing subsequence from the next element with the current element itself, and update `max_product_suf` accordingly.

Finally, we calculate the maximum product of all the increasing subsequences by multiplying the maximum product of `max_product_sub` and `max_product_suf` at each index.
