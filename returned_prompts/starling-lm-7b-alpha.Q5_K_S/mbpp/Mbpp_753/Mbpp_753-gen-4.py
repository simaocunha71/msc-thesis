To solve this problem, you can use the built-in function min() along with a lambda function as the key to find the minimum element in a list of tuples based on a specific attribute. Here is a step-by-step guide:

1. Define the function min_k(tuples, k): This function takes a list of tuples and an integer k as input.

2. Use the min() function to find the minimum element in the list of tuples. Pass a lambda function as the key to specify the attribute to compare the elements. In this case, we want to find the minimum k records, so we will compare the second element of each tuple (the score). The lambda function should look like this: lambda x: x[1]

3. The min() function will return the minimum tuple. To get the minimum k records, we need to find the k smallest elements. We can use a loop to iterate over the list of tuples and check if the first element of each tuple is the same as the first element of the minimum tuple. If it is, add the tuple to the result list. If it is not, break the loop. The result list will contain the minimum k records.

4. Return the result list from the min_k() function.

Here is the Python code for the min_k() function:

def min_k(tuples, k):
    min_tuple = min(tuples, key=lambda x: x[1])
    result = []
    for t in tuples:
        if t[0] == min_tuple[0]:
            result.append(t)
            if len(result) == k:
                break
    return result

To test the min_k() function, you can use the assert statement to check if the output of the function matches the expected output. Here is an example:

assert min_k([('Manjeet', 10), ('Akshat', 4), ('Akash', 2), ('Nikhil', 8)], 2) == [('Akash', 2), ('Akshat', 4)]

This will pass if the min_k() function is working correctly and returns the minimum k records from the list of tuples.
