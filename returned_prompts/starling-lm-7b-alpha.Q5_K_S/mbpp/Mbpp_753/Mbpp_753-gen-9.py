    tup_list.sort(key = lambda x : x[1])
    return tup_list[:k]
```
This function will take a list of tuple as an argument and return the minimum k records from that list, sorted on the basis of the second element of the tuple.

The function first sorts the tuple list based on the second element of the tuple. Then it returns the first k elements of the sorted tuple list.
