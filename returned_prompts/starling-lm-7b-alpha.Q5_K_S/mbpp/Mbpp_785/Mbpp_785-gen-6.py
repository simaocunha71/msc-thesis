To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Define a function called `tuple_str_int` that takes a single argument, `tuple_str`, which is a string representing a tuple.
2. Use the `replace()` method to remove the parentheses from the string. This will leave only the tuple contents.
3. Use the `split()` method to separate the contents of the tuple into a list. By default, `split()` will split the string at each comma.
4. Use list comprehension to convert each item in the list to an integer. This will create a new list with the same elements, but as integers.
5. Use the `tuple()` function to convert the list back into a tuple. This will create a new tuple with the same elements as the list, but as integers.
6. Return the integer tuple.
7. Test the `tuple_str_int` function with the provided example, `(7, 8, 9)`. This should return the tuple `(7, 8, 9)`.

# The above code defines a function called `tuple_str_int` that takes a single argument, `tuple_str`, which is a string representing a tuple. The function uses several methods to convert the string to an integer tuple. It first removes the parentheses from the string using the `replace()` method. Then, it splits the string at each comma using the `split()` method, which leaves a list of the tuple's contents. Next, the function uses list comprehension to convert each item in the list to an integer. Finally, the function uses the `tuple()` function to convert the list back into a tuple. The function then returns the integer tuple. The last line of code tests the `tuple_str_int` function with the provided example, `(7, 8, 9)`. This should print the tuple `(7, 8,
