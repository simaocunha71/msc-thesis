```
def tuple_str_int(s):
    return tuple(map(int, s.split(',')))
```

Explanation:
Here is a function that takes a string as input and returns a tuple of integers. It uses the `split()` method to split the string by the comma, and then uses the `map()` method to convert each substring to an integer. Finally, the `tuple()` function is used to convert the resulting list of integers to a tuple.

For example, if the input is `"(7, 8, 9)"`, the function will first split the string by the comma, resulting in a list `["(7", " 8", " 9)"]`. Then, it will use `map(int, ...)` to convert each substring to an integer, resulting in a list `[7, 8, 9]`. Finally, it will use `tuple(...)` to convert the list to a tuple, resulting in `(7, 8, 9)`.

The assertion `assert tuple_str_int("(7, 8, 9)") == (7, 8, 9)` checks that the function correctly converts the input `"(7, 8, 9)"` to the expected output `(7, 8, 9)`.

In general, this function can be used to convert any string representation of a tuple of integers to an actual tuple of integers.

Note: It is important to ensure that the input string is a valid tuple of integers, otherwise the function may raise an error.
