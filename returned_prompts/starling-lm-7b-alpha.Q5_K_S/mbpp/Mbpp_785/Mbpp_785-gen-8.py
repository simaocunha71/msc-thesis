```

Explanation:
The function `tuple_str_int` takes a string as input, splits it at each comma, and then converts each piece of the split to an integer using the `int` function. It then returns the result of passing the list of integers through the `tuple` function, which creates a tuple from the list of integers.

Here's an example usage of the function:

```python
print(tuple_str_int("(7, 8, 9)"))  # Output: (7, 8, 9)
```

In this example, the function is called with the string `"(7, 8, 9)"`. The function splits the string at each comma, resulting in the list `["7", "8", "9"]`. It then converts each element of the list to an integer using the `int` function, resulting in the list `[7, 8, 9]`. Finally, the function passes the list of integers through the `tuple` function, which creates a tuple from the list, resulting in the tuple `(7, 8, 9)`. The function returns this tuple, and it is printed to the console as the output.

Note that the function assumes that the input string is a valid tuple string, meaning that it starts and ends with parentheses, and contains integers separated by commas. If the input string is not a valid tuple string, the function may not produce the expected result.

It's important to note that the `split` method returns a list of strings, even if the original string is a number. This is because the `split` method splits on the delimiter (in this case, the comma) and returns a list of substrings. Therefore, the `map` function is used to convert each string to an integer using the `int` function.

In summary, the `tuple_str_int` function takes a string representing a tuple of integers, splits the string at each comma, converts each piece of the split to an integer using the `int` function, and then returns the result of passing the list of integers through the `tuple` function
