To check whether a given number is a perfect square or not, we can use the following steps:

1. Calculate the square root of the number. If the square root is an integer, then the number is a perfect square. Otherwise, it is not a perfect square.

2. To calculate the square root of a number, we can use the `math.sqrt()` function from the `math` module in Python. The `math.sqrt()` function returns the square root of a given number.

3. After calculating the square root, we can check if it is an integer or not. We can use the `isinstance()` function to check if the square root is an integer or not. The `isinstance()` function returns `True` if the given object is of the specified type, otherwise it returns `False`.

4. If the square root is an integer, we can return `True`, indicating that the number is a perfect square. Otherwise, we can return `False`, indicating that the number is not a perfect square.

Here is an example implementation of the `is_perfect_square()` function:

```python
import math

def is_perfect_square(n):
    root = math.sqrt(n)
    return int(root) == root
```

In this implementation, the `is_perfect_square()` function takes a number `n` as input and calculates its square root using the `math.sqrt()` function. Then, it checks if the square root is an integer or not. If the square root is an integer, the function returns `True`, indicating that the number is a perfect square. Otherwise, it returns `False`, indicating that the number is not a perfect square.

You can use the `is_perfect_square()` function to check whether a given number is a perfect square or not. For example, to check if the number 10 is a perfect square, you can use the following code:

```python
print(is_perfect_square(10))  # Output: False
```

The output of this code will be `False`, indicating that the number 10 is not a perfect square.
