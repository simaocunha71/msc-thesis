step by step explanation:
To find the perimeter of a regular pentagon from the length of its sides, you simply multiply the length of each side by the number of sides, which in this case is 5. The function `perimeter_pentagon` takes the length of the sides as an argument and returns the product of the sides length and the number of sides, which gives you the perimeter of the pentagon. The `print` statement at the end of the code calls the function with an argument of 5, meaning the length of each side is 5. The function then returns the product of 5 and 5, which is 25.

The assert statement at the top of the code is a way to check if the function is working correctly. It checks if the function `perimeter_pentagon` returns the correct value when given an argument of 5, which is 25. If the function does not return the correct value, the program will raise an AssertionError, indicating that there is an error in the function.

Overall, this code provides a simple solution to finding the perimeter of a regular pentagon from the length of its sides, and includes a check to ensure the function is working correctly.

In this code, we define a function called `perimeter_pentagon` that takes a single argument `sides`, which represents the length of the sides of the pentagon. The function then multiplies the length of each side by the number of sides
