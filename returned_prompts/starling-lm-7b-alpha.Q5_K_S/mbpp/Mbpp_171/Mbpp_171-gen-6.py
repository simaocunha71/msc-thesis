Here is a Python program for the above problem:

```python
def perimeter_pentagon(n):
    return n * 5
```

To test the above function, you can use the `assert` statement in Python, as shown in the comment in the question:

```python
assert perimeter_pentagon(5) == 25
```

This will raise an `AssertionError` if the function does not return the expected result, making it easy to verify and debug your implementation.

Explanation:

The question asks for a function to calculate the perimeter of a regular pentagon. In a regular pentagon, all sides have the same length. The perimeter of a regular polygon is simply the product of the number of sides and the length of one side. In this case, the number of sides is 5 (as in the question).

The function `perimeter_pentagon` takes one argument, `n`, which represents the length of one side of the pentagon. It returns the perimeter of the pentagon, which is `n * 5`.

To verify the correctness of the function, the `assert` statement is used. The `assert` statement in Python checks if a given expression is True. If the expression is False, an `AssertionError` is raised. In this case, the expression `perimeter_pentagon(5) == 25` is checked. If the function returns 25 for the input 5, the `assert` statement will not raise an error. Otherwise, an `AssertionError` will be raised, indicating that the function is not correct.

This allows you to easily test and debug your implementation, ensuring that it correctly calculates the perimeter of a regular pentagon.

```python
def perimeter_pentagon(n):
    return n * 5

assert perimeter_pentagon(5) == 25
```

When you run the above code, it will pass the `assert` statement and not raise any errors, indicating that the function is correctly implemented.

```python
perimeter_pentagon(5)
```

When you call the function with the input 5, it will return 25, which is the correct result for the perimeter of a regular pentagon with side length
