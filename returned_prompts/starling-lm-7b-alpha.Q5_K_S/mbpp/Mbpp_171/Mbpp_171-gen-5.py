The regular pentagon has all sides equal, so the perimeter is simply the length of a side times the number of sides, which is 5.

Here's a function that calculates the perimeter of a regular pentagon with a given side length:

```python
def perimeter_pentagon(s):
    return s * 5
```

In this function, `s` is the length of a side of the pentagon, and the function returns the perimeter of the pentagon, which is `s * 5`.

To verify that the function works correctly, the code includes an assertion that checks if the function returns the expected result for a pentagon with a side length of 5, which is 25. If the function doesn't return the correct result, the assertion will raise an `AssertionError` exception.

Finally, the code calls the function with a side length of 5 and prints the result, which should be 25.

To find the perimeter of a regular pentagon from the length of its sides, you can use the formula:

perimeter = number of sides * length of a side

In this case, the number of sides for a pentagon is 5, so the formula becomes:

perimeter = 5 * length of a side
