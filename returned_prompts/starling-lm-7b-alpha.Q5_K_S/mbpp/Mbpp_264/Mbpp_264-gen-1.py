```
def dog_age(human_years):
    return human_years * 7
```

In this example, the function `dog_age` takes a single parameter `human_years`, which represents the age of the dog in human years. The function then calculates the dog's age in dog years by multiplying the `human_years` parameter by 7. The result is returned as the output of the function.

To test the function, the `assert` statement is used to verify if the function correctly calculates the dog's age in dog years. In this case, `dog_age(12)` should return 61, so the `assert` statement checks if the result of `dog_age(12)` is equal to 61. If the condition is true, the `assert` statement does nothing and the program continues executing. If the condition is false, an `AssertionError` is raised, indicating that the function is not correctly calculating the dog's age in dog years.

In summary, the `dog_age` function takes a single parameter representing the age of the dog in human years and returns the dog's age in dog years. The `assert` statement is used to verify if the function is correctly calculating the dog's age in dog years, ensuring that the function is working as expected.
