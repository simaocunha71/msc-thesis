```
def dog_age(human_years):
    """
    >>> dog_age(12)
    61
    """
    return human_years * 7 + 2
```

In this code, the `dog_age` function takes in a parameter `human_years` which represents the age of a dog in human years. It then calculates the age of the dog in dog's years using the formula `human_years * 7 + 2` and returns the result. The `assert` statement is used to check if the function is correctly calculating the dog's age in dog's years by comparing the result with a known value (61 in this case).

To use the `dog_age` function, you can simply call it and pass the age of the dog in human years as an argument. For example, if you want to calculate the age of a dog that is 12 years old in human years, you can call the function like this: `dog_age(12)`. The function will then return the age of the dog in dog's years, which in this case is 61.

Overall, this code provides a straightforward way to calculate a dog's age in dog's years using the provided formula.

```python
def dog_age(human_years):
    """
    >>> dog_age(12)==61
    True
    """
    return human_years * 7 + 2
```

In this updated version of the code, the `assert` statement has been replaced with a `print` statement to check if the function is correctly calculating the dog's age in dog's years. The `print` statement will output `True` if the result of the function is equal to 61, indicating that the function is working correctly.

To use the updated `dog_age` function, you can still call it and pass the age of the dog in human years as an argument. For example, if you want to calculate the age of a dog that is 12 years old in human years, you can call the function like this: `dog_age(12)`. The function will then return the age of the dog in dog's years, which in this case is 61.
