"""
In the above function, the replace() method is used to replace all occurrences of spaces, commas, and dots with a colon.
The replace() function is a built-in Python function that is used to replace all occurrences of a specified phrase with another specified phrase.
It takes two arguments: the string that we want to replace, and the string that we want to replace it with.

The replace() function does not modify the original string; instead, it returns a new string.
That's why we need to assign the result of the replace() function to a new variable.

Finally, we return the new string which has all occurrences of spaces, commas, and dots replaced with a colon.
