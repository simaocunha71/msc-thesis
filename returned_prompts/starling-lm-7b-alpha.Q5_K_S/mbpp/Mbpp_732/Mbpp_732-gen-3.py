"""
Explanation:
The function replace_specialchar takes one argument, a string, and returns the same string but with all occurrences of spaces, commas, and dots replaced with a colon. The function uses the built-in Python function replace to accomplish this. The replace function takes two arguments, the first is the character or substring to be replaced and the second is the character or substring to replace it with. The function is tested by passing the string 'Python language, Programming language.' to the function and asserting that the return value is 'Python:language::Programming:language:'.
