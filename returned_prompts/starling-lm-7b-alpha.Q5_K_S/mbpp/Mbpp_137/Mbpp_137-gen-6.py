In this problem we have to find the ratio of zeroes to non-zeroes in an array of integers. We can do this by first finding the number of zeroes and non-zeroes in the array and then dividing the count of zeroes by the count of non-zeroes.

To find the count of zeroes in the array, we can use the `count()` method of Python's built-in list and then divide this count by the total length of the array to find the proportion of zeroes. Similarly, we can find the count of non-zeroes by subtracting the count of zeroes from the total length of the array.

Here is the Python code for the `zero_count()` function:

```python
def zero_count(arr):
    zero_count = arr.count(0)
    total_count = len(arr)
    return zero_count / total_count
```

In this code, the `zero_count` variable holds the count of zeroes in the array, the `total_count` variable holds the total length of the array, and the `return` statement returns the ratio of zeroes to non-zeroes.

To test this function, you can use the `assert` statement to check if the result of the function is close to the expected result within a certain tolerance. In this case, we are expecting the ratio of zeroes to non-zeroes to be 0.181818, and the `math.isclose()` function is used to check if the result is within a tolerance of 0.001.

Here is the Python code to test the `zero_count()` function:

```python
import math

def zero_count(arr):
    zero_count = arr.count(0)
    total_count = len(arr)
    return zero_count / total_count

assert math.isclose(zero_count([0, 1, 2, -1, -5, 6, 0, -3, -2, 3, 4, 6, 8]), 0.181818, rel_tol=0.001)
```

In this code, the `zero_count()` function is called
