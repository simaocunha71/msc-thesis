def zero_count(arr):
    count = 0

This is a Python function that counts the number of zeroes in a given array of integers and then divides the count by the length of the array. The function `math.isclose` is used to compare the result of the function with the expected value and check if the relative tolerance is within the acceptable range.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. The function `zero_count` takes an array `arr` as input.
2. It initializes a variable `count` to keep track of the number of zeroes found in the array.
3. It then iterates through each element `i` in the array.
4. If the element `i` is equal to 0, it increments the `count` variable by 1.
5. After iterating through all the elements in the array, it returns the `count` divided by the length of the array, which gives the ratio of zeroes to non-zeroes.
6. Finally, the function `math.isclose` is used to compare the result of the function with the expected value (0.181818) and check if the relative tolerance (0.001) is within the acceptable range.

Overall, this function provides a way to calculate the ratio of zeroes to non-zeroes in an array of integers and checks if the result is within the expected range.

```python
import math

def zero_count(arr):
    count = 0
    for i in arr:
        if i == 0:
            count += 1
    return count / len(arr)

assert math.isclose(zero_count([0, 1, 2, -1, -5, 6, 0, -3, -2, 3, 4, 6, 8]), 0.181818, rel_tol=0.001)
```

You can use the `zero_count` function to calculate the ratio of zeroes to non-zeroes in any array of integers
