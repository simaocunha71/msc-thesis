    # Loop through the range and add the square of each number
    for i in range(1, n+1):

As you can see, the function `square_Sum` takes an integer `n` as an argument and calculates the sum of the squares of the first `n` even natural numbers. It does this by initializing a variable `sum` to 0 and then using a loop to iterate through the range from 1 to `n`, adding the square of each number to the sum. Finally, it returns the sum.

To test the function, we call it with the argument `2` and print the result, which should be `20`.

The function correctly calculates the sum of squares of the first `n` even natural numbers, as specified in the problem statement.
