"""
The function square_Sum() calculates the sum of squares of first n even natural numbers. It is implemented using a for loop that iterates through the range of even numbers from 2 to n (inclusive). Inside the loop, each number is squared and added to the running total sum. Finally, the sum is returned by the function.

The assert statement is used to test the correctness of the function. It checks if the return value of square_Sum(2) is equal to 20, which is the expected result. If the assertion is true, the program will continue to execute normally. Otherwise, an error message will be raised, indicating that the function is not working as expected.
