Here's a Python function that takes in an integer n and returns the sum of squares of the first n even natural numbers:

```python
def square_Sum(n):
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1, 2):
        total += i**2
    return total
```

To verify that the function is working correctly, we can use the `assert` keyword in Python to check if the function returns the expected result for a specific test case. In this case, we can check if `square_Sum(2)` equals `20`. Here's the assertion:

```python
assert square_Sum(2) == 20
```

When we run the script, Python will check if the condition `square_Sum(2) == 20` is true. If it is, the script will continue running. However, if the condition is false, Python will raise an `AssertionError` with a message indicating that the assertion failed.

In this case, since the function `square_Sum(2)` does indeed equal `20`, the assertion will pass and the script will continue running without any errors.

```python
def square_Sum(n):
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1, 2):
        total += i**2
    return total

assert square_Sum(2) == 20
```

This function will output `20` when called with the argument `2`.

```python
print(square_Sum(2))  # Output: 20
```

In the function, `i` starts from `1` and increments by `2` in each iteration. This ensures that only even numbers are considered. The function calculates the square of each even number and adds it to the `total` variable. Finally, it returns the `total` sum of squares of the first `n` even natural numbers.

The `assert` statement is used to verify if the function is correctly returning the expected result for a specific test case. If the condition `square_Sum(2) == 20` is true, the assertion will pass and the script will continue running. Otherwise, an `AssertionError` will be raised
