Explanation:
This function uses a for loop to calculate the sum of squares of first n even natural numbers. It starts the loop from 1 and ends at n. It adds the square of each number to the result variable. Finally, it returns the result.

To validate this function, you can call the function with a test value like `square_Sum(2)` which should return `20`.

Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. Initialize the result variable `res` to 0. This variable will store the sum of squares of even natural numbers.
2. Use a for loop to iterate through the range of 1 to `n + 1`. This will include all the even natural numbers from 1 to `n`.
3. Inside the loop, add the square of each number to the result variable `res`. This is done using the expression `res += i ** 2`.
4. After the loop is finished, return the result variable `res`. This will be the sum of squares of all even natural numbers from 1 to `n`.

In the given code, the function `square_Sum` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of squares of the first `n` even natural numbers. The function uses a for loop to iterate through the range of 1 to `n + 1` and adds the square of each number to the result variable `res`. Finally, the function returns the result.

To validate the function, you can call it with a test value like `square_Sum(2)` which should return `20`.

Note: The function assumes that `n` is a positive integer.

Here's an example usage of the function:

```python
print(square_Sum(2))  # Output: 20
```

This code will print the result of `square_Sum(2)` which should be `20`.

It's important to note that this function only calculates the sum of squares of the first `n` even natural numbers, not the sum of squares of the
