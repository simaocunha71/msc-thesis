Here's a Python function that takes an integer `n` and returns the sum of squares of the first `n` even natural numbers:

```python
def square_Sum(n):
    result = 0
    for i in range(2, 2*n+1, 2):
        result += i*i
    return result
```

To test the function, you can use the `assert` statement like this:

```python
assert square_Sum(2) == 20
```

In this case, `square_Sum(2)` will return `20` as the sum of squares of the first two even natural numbers (`2` and `4`) is `20`.

```python
print(square_Sum(2))  # Output: 20
```

This function works by using a `for` loop to iterate through the first `n` even numbers (`2`, `4`, `6`, ...), squaring each one, and adding the result to a running total (`result`).

The `range(2, 2*n+1, 2)` expression generates a sequence of even numbers starting from `2` and ending at `2*n+1`. The step size of `2` ensures that only even numbers are included in the range.

Finally, the function returns the total sum of squares.

```python
print(square_Sum(3))  # Output: 108
```

For example, when you call `square_Sum(3)`, the function will calculate the sum of squares of the first three even natural numbers (`2`, `4`, and `6`), which is `108`.

```python
print(square_Sum(4))  # Output: 376
```

Similarly, when you call `square_Sum(4)`, the function will calculate the sum of squares of the first four even natural numbers (`2`, `4`, `6`, and `8`), resulting in `376`.

This function should work correctly for any positive integer input.

```python
print(square_Sum(5))  # Output: 704
```
