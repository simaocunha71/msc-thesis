Here's one way you can define the function:

```python
def square_Sum(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return (n * (n+1) * (2 * n + 1)) // 6
```

This function works by using the formula for the sum of the squares of an arithmetic series. The formula is given by (n * (n+1) * (2 * n + 1)) // 6, where n is the number of terms in the series.

The function first checks if n is less than or equal to 0. If so, it returns 0, since there are no even natural numbers in this case. Otherwise, it calculates the sum of squares using the formula and returns the result.

To verify that the function works correctly, you can use the `assert` statement to check if the function returns the expected result for the example you provided (square_Sum(2) == 20). This will raise an `AssertionError` if the function doesn't return the correct result.

Here's an example of how you can test the function:

```python
def test_square_Sum():
    assert square_Sum(2) == 20
    print("All tests passed!")

test_square_Sum()
```

When you run this code, it will print "All tests passed!" if the function returns the correct result for the example you provided.

def square_Sum(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return (n * (n+1) * (2 * n + 1)) // 6

def test_square_Sum():
    assert square_Sum(2) == 20
    print("All tests passed!")

test_square_Sum()
```

This code defines the `square_Sum` function and a test function `test_square_Sum` that calls the `square_Sum` function with the example value of 2 and asserts that the result is equal to 20. If the assertion is true, it prints "All tests passed!" to indicate that the function is working correctly.
