def overlapping(seq1, seq2):

# Testing the function
assert overlapping([1,2,3,4,5],[6,7,8,9]) == False













"""
In this code, the overlapping function is defined to take two sequences, seq1 and seq2, as input. The function uses a generator expression to check if any element from seq1 is present in seq2. The any() function is used to check if at least one element from the generator expression is true, indicating that an element from seq1 exists in seq2. The function returns True if there is an overlap between the two sequences, and False otherwise.

To test the function, a sample case is provided where the function is called with the sequences [1,2,3,4,5] and [6,7,8,9]. The expected result is False, indicating that there is no overlap between these two sequences. The assert statement is used to verify that the actual result matches the expected result, and an error is raised if they do not match.
