Here's a possible solution:

def min_of_three(a,b,c):
    if a<=b and a<=c:
        return a
    if b<=c:
        return b
    return c

Here's a possible solution:

```python
def min_of_three(a, b, c):
    return min(a, b, c)
```

The `min()` function in Python returns the smallest item in an iterable or the smallest of two or more arguments. By passing `a`, `b`, and `c` as arguments to `min()`, we can find the minimum of three numbers with a single line of code.

To test the function with the provided assertion, we can simply call `min_of_three(10, 20, 0)` and compare the result to `0`. Since `0` is indeed the minimum value among `10`, `20`, and `0`, the assertion will pass and the function will correctly identify the minimum value.

Overall, using the `min()` function simplifies the process of finding the minimum of three numbers, eliminating the need for a series of conditional statements.

```python
def min_of_three(a, b, c):
    return min(a, b, c)
```
```python
assert min_of_three(10, 20, 0) == 0
```
```python
def min_of_three(a, b, c):
    if a <= b and a <= c:
        return a
    if b <= c:
        return b
    return c
```
```python
assert min_of_three(10, 20, 0) == 0
```
```python
def min_of_three(a, b, c):
    if a <= b and a <= c:
        return a
    if b <= c:
        return b
    return c
```
```python
assert min_of_three(10, 20, 0) == 0
```
```python
def min_of_three(a, b, c):
