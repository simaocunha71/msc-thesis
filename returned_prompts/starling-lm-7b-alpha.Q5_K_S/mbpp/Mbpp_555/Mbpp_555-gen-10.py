Here's one possible solution:

```python
def difference(n):
    sum_cubes = sum([i ** 3 for i in range(1, n + 1)])
    sum_numbers = sum([i for i in range(1, n + 1)])
    return sum_cubes - sum_numbers
```

This function uses list comprehension to calculate the sum of cubes and the sum of the first n natural numbers. The function then subtracts the two sums to get the desired difference.

For example, if we call `difference(3)`, it will return `30`, which is the correct result.

```python
print(difference(3))  # Output: 30
```

This solution should pass the provided assertion and give the correct result for the given problem.

```python
assert difference(3) == 30
```

```python
def difference(n):
    sum_cubes = sum([i ** 3 for i in range(1, n + 1)])
    sum_numbers = sum([i for i in range(1, n + 1)])
    return sum_cubes - sum_numbers
```

This Python function calculates the difference between the sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers and the sum of the first n natural numbers. It uses list comprehension to calculate both sums and then subtracts them to get the desired difference. The assertion `assert difference(3) == 30` checks if the function correctly returns `30` for the input `3`, which it should.

```python
print(difference(3))  # Output: 30
```

This code demonstrates the usage of the function and confirms that it produces the correct result for the provided example.

```python
assert difference(3) == 30
```

```python
def difference(n):
    sum_cubes = sum([i ** 3 for i in range(1, n + 1)])
    sum_numbers = sum([i for i in range(1, n + 1)])
    return sum_c
