To solve this kata, you can follow these steps:

1. Define a function called `difference` that takes an integer `n` as input.
2. Calculate the sum of the first `n` natural numbers using the formula `(n * (n + 1)) / 2`. Store the result in a variable called `sum_of_nums`.
3. Calculate the sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers using the formula `n * (n + 1) * (2n + 1) / 6`. Store the result in a variable called `sum_of_cubes`.
4. Calculate the difference between the sum of cubes and the sum of natural numbers by subtracting `sum_of_nums` from `sum_of_cubes`. Store the result in a variable called `difference`.
5. Finally, return the calculated `difference` as the result of the function.

Here's the Python code to implement the above solution:

```python
def difference(n):
    sum_of_nums = (n * (n + 1)) / 2
    sum_of_cubes = n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) / 6
    difference = sum_of_cubes - sum_of_nums
    return difference
```

Now you can test the function by calling `difference(3)` and it should return `30`, as stated in the question.

def difference(n):
    sum_of_nums = (n * (n + 1)) / 2
    sum_of_cubes = n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) / 6
    difference = sum_of_cubes - sum_of_nums
    return difference

assert difference(3) == 30
# The function should return 30.
```

```python
def difference(n):
    sum_of_nums = (n * (n + 1)) / 2
    sum_of_cubes = n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) /
