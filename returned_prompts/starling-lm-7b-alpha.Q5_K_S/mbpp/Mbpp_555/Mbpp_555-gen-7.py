Here's a Python function to solve the problem:

```python
def difference(n):
    sum_cubes = sum([i ** 3 for i in range(1, n + 1)])
    sum_naturals = sum([i for i in range(1, n + 1)])
    return sum_cubes - sum_naturals
```

The function `difference` takes a single argument `n`, which represents the number of natural numbers to consider. It first calculates the sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers using list comprehension and the built-in `sum` function. Then, it calculates the sum of the first `n` natural numbers using list comprehension and the built-in `sum` function. Finally, it returns the difference between these two sums.

To test the function, you can use the `assert` statement to check if the function returns the expected result for a specific value of `n`. In this case, `assert difference(3) == 30` asserts that the function should return 30 when `n` is 3.

```python
def difference(n):
    sum_cubes = sum([i ** 3 for i in range(1, n + 1)])
    sum_naturals = sum([i for i in range(1, n + 1)])
    return sum_cubes - sum_naturals

assert difference(3) == 30
```

This code will print `True` if the assertion is satisfied, indicating that the function correctly calculates the difference between the sum of cubes and the sum of natural numbers for the given input.
