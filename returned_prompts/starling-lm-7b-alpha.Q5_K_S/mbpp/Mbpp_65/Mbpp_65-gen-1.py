Here's one way to do it:

```python
def recursive_list_sum(lst):
    flat = []
    def flatten(lst):
        for i in lst:
            if isinstance(i, list):
                flatten(i)
            else:
                flat.append(i)
    flatten(lst)
    return sum(flat)
```

And here's a more efficient version using generator expressions:

```python
def recursive_list_sum(lst):
    return sum(i for sublist in lst for i in sublist)
```

The first function works by recursively flattening the list using a helper function, `flatten`. The second function works by iterating over each element in the list, and if the element is a list, it iterates over the sub-list as well.

Both functions return the sum of all elements in the flattened list.

To check the result, you can use the `assert` statement like this:

```python
assert recursive_list_sum([1, 2, [3,4],[5,6]])==21
```

This will raise an `AssertionError` if the result of `recursive_list_sum` is not equal to 21.

```python
def recursive_list_sum(lst):
    flat = []
    def flatten(lst):
        for i in lst:
            if isinstance(i, list):
                flatten(i)
            else:
                flat.append(i)
    flatten(lst)
    return sum(flat)
```

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the first function works:

1. The `recursive_list_sum` function takes a list as input.
2. It initializes an empty list, `flat`, to store the flattened elements.
3. The `flatten` function is a helper function that takes a list as input and recursively flattens it.
4. The `flatten` function iterates over each element in the input list.
5. If the element is a list, the `flatten` function is called
