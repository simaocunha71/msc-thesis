# The above code will count all substrings including the empty ones. So, we should modify it to exclude the empty substrings. Here's the modified function:

def number_of_substrings(string):
    length = len(string)
    n = length * (length - 1) // 2
    return n

To verify the function, we can use the following test case:

assert number_of_substrings("abc") == 3

This will return True if the function correctly counts the number of non-empty substrings of the given string.

Explanation:
The function `number_of_substrings` takes a string as input and calculates the number of non-empty substrings of the string. It does this by finding the length of the string and then calculating the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, where `n` is the length of the string. The sum of the first `n` natural numbers can be calculated using the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`. This gives us the total number of substrings, including the empty ones. To exclude the empty substrings, we subtract the length of the string from the total number of substrings. This gives us the number of non-empty substrings of the string.

The provided test case `assert number_of_substrings("abc") == 3` verifies that the function correctly counts the number of non-empty substrings of the string "abc". The function should return 3, as there are three non-empty substrings in the string "abc": "a", "ab", and "abc".

The function correctly counts the number of non-empty substrings of a given string by using the formula for the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, and then subtracting the length of the string from the total number of substrings to exclude the empty substrings.

Overall, the function and the test case correctly count the number of non-empty substrings of a given string.
