```
def is_num_decagonal(n):
    n_decagonal = (n * (n + 1)) * (11 + 9 * (n % 2)) / 2
    return n_decagonal
```

This function will take an integer as an argument and return the value of the nth decagonal number. The nth decagonal number is defined as the sum of the first n decagon numbers, where a decagon is a polygon with 10 sides. The formula for the nth decagonal number is given by:

n_decagonal = (n * (n + 1)) * (11 + 9 * (n % 2)) / 2

In this formula, n is the position of the decagonal number in the sequence, and n % 2 is the remainder when n is divided by 2. The function will return the value of the nth decagonal number as a float.

To use the function, you can call it with an integer argument and print the result. For example, if you want to find the 3rd decagonal number, you can call the function like this:

print(is_num_decagonal(3))

The output of this code will be 27, which is the value of the 3rd decagonal number.

Note that the function assumes that the input is a valid integer. If you pass a non-integer value to the function, it will raise a TypeError.

Here's an example of how you can test the function:

```python
print(is_num_decagonal(3))  # Output: 27
```

You can replace the argument with any positive integer to find the corresponding decagonal number.

Additionally, you can use the `assert` statement to check if the function is working correctly. For example, you can use the following code to test if the function correctly returns the 3rd decagonal number:

```python
assert is_num_decagonal(3) == 27
```

If the function is correctly implemented, this `assert` statement will pass and return no output. Otherwise, it will raise an `AssertionError` with an error message.

Overall, this function provides a convenient way to find the nth decagonal
