Explanation:

This code defines a function `magic_square_test` that takes a matrix as input and checks whether it is a magic square. A magic square is a square grid of numbers with the following properties:

1. Each row, column, and diagonal adds up to the same number. This number is called the "magic constant" of the square.
2. No number is repeated within a row, column, or diagonal.
3. The square is always a perfect square.

In the provided code, the function checks whether each row in the matrix contains all the numbers from the first row, and whether each column contains all the numbers from the first column. It also checks whether the sum of the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right), the secondary diagonal (top-right to bottom-left), and the third diagonal (bottom-left to top-right) are equal. If any of these conditions fail, the function returns False, indicating that the matrix is not a magic square. Otherwise, it returns True.

The code then creates a sample matrix and calls the `magic_square_test` function on it. The result is printed, which in this case is True, indicating that the matrix is indeed
