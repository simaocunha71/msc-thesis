To search a string for a regex pattern, we can use the `re` module in Python. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:

1. First, import the `re` module:
```python
import re
```

2. Next, define a function `find_literals` that takes in two parameters: the string to be searched (`s`) and the regex pattern to be matched (`pattern`):
```python
def find_literals(s, pattern):
```

3. Inside the function, use the `re.search()` function to find the first occurrence of the pattern in the string:
```python
    match = re.search(pattern, s)
```

4. If a match is found (i.e., `match` is not `None`), return the matched string, the start index, and the end index. The start index can be obtained using `match.start()`, and the end index can be obtained using `match.end()`:
```python
    if match:
        return match.group(), match.start(), match.end()
```

5. If no match is found, return `None` to indicate that no match was found:
```python
    return None
```

6. Finally, you can call the `find_literals` function with a sample string and pattern to test it:
```python
print(find_literals('The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.', 'fox'))  # Output: ('fox', 16, 19)
```

This will print `('fox', 16, 19)`, indicating that the pattern 'fox' was found starting at index 16 and ending at index 19 in the string 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'.

Note: The `re.search()` function only returns the first occurrence of the pattern. If you need to find all occurrences of the pattern, you can use the `re.findall()` function instead.
