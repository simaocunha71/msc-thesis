In this code, the function `eulerian_num` takes two arguments, `n` and `m`, and returns the Eulerian number `a(n, m)`. The Eulerian number is the number of Eulerian cycles in a graph with `n` vertices and `m` edges.

The code first checks if `n` and `m` are both even. If they are, then all the vertices in the graph have even degree, and the Eulerian number is 2. This is because in an Eulerian graph, each vertex must have an even degree.

If `n` and `m` are not both even, the code proceeds to compute the number of vertices of odd degree. It does this by repeatedly adding 2 to the sum of the degrees until the sum is at most `n`. The number of vertices of odd degree is then computed as `n - k + 1`, where `k` is the sum of the degrees modulo 2.

The function returns the Eulerian number `a(n,
