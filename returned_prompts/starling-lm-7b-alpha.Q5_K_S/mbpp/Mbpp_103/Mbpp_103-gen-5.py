def eulerian_num(n, m):
    a = 0
    for i in range(n+1):
        if i == m:
            continue
        a += (n-i) * m**(n-i-1)
    return a
```

This function calculates the Eulerian number a(n, m) by iterating over all possible values of i from 0 to n, and multiplying (n-i) by m raised to the power of (n-i-1). The result is accumulated in the variable a and returned at the end.

The Eulerian number a(n, m) is a generalization of the concept of Eulerian cycles in a graph, where the graph has m vertices and n edges. The Eulerian number represents the total number of cycles in a graph with m vertices and n edges, and can be used to determine whether a graph is Eulerian or not.

In the given code, the function eulerian_num takes two arguments: n and m. It initializes a variable a to 0, which will store the Eulerian number. Then, it iterates over all possible values of i from 0 to n using a for loop. Inside the loop, it checks if i is equal to m, and if so, it skips the current iteration using the continue statement. Otherwise, it calculates the contribution of i to the Eulerian number by multiplying (n-i) by m raised to the power of (n-i-1), and adds it to a. Finally, it returns the accumulated Eulerian number a.

The assertion `assert eulerian_num(3, 1) == 4` checks if the function eulerian_num correctly calculates the Eulerian number for the given input values of n=3 and m=1. The expected result is 4, so the assertion will pass if the function returns 4 for these input values.

Overall, the function eulerian_num calculates the Eulerian number a(n, m) using the provided formula, and can be used to determine the total number of cycles in a graph with m vertices and n edges.
