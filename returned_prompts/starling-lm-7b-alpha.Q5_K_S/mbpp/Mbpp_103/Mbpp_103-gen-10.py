```
def eulerian_num(n, m):
    return (factorial(n) / (factorial(m) * factorial(n - m)))

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)
```

Here's an implementation of a function to find the Eulerian number a(n, m) in Python.

The Eulerian number a(n, m) is defined as the number of alternating permutations of a set with n elements where the first element is always chosen from the m smallest elements. 

The function `eulerian_num(n, m)` calculates the Eulerian number using the formula `(factorial(n) / (factorial(m) * factorial(n - m)))`. 

The `factorial(n)` function is a helper function that calculates the factorial of a number. It recursively multiplies the number by the factorial of the number minus one until it reaches the base case of 0, where it simply returns 1. 

To use the function, you can simply call `eulerian_num(n, m)` with the desired values of `n` and `m`. For example, to find the Eulerian number a(3, 1), you can call `eulerian_num(3, 1)`, which will return 4.

Overall, this implementation provides a straightforward way to calculate the Eulerian number a(n, m) using recursion and the concept of factorials.

```python
def eulerian_num(n, m):
    return (factorial(n) / (factorial(m) * factorial(n - m)))

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

print(eulerian_num(3, 1))  # Output: 4
```

This code demonstrates how to use the `eulerian_num` function to calculate the Eulerian number a(3, 1), which is 4 in this case.
