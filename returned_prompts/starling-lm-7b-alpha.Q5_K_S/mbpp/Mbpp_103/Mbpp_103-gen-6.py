"""
This function works by creating all permutations of the numbers from 0 to n-1, and then checking if any of these permutations result in an Eulerian graph. While the algorithm is not particularly efficient (it is O(n!) in terms of time complexity), it is correct and will correctly determine if an Eulerian path exists.

# However, it is worth noting that the Eulerian number a(n, m) can be computed using a more efficient algorithm that is O(n). This algorithm is described in the Wikipedia article on Eulerian paths and trails, and it can be implemented as follows:

def eulerian_num_fast(n, m):
    # If m is 0, there are no Eulerian paths
    if m == 0:
        return 0
    # If n is 1, there is exactly one Eulerian path
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    # If n is 2, there are two Eulerian paths
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    # If m is 1, there are n Eulerian paths
    elif m == 1:
        return n
    # Otherwise, we can compute a(n, m)
