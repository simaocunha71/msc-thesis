"""
To solve this problem, you can use list comprehension in Python. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this:

1. Define the two lists, list1 and list2, that you will be using to solve this problem.

2. Create a new list called result to store the elements that are not present in list2. You can do this by using list comprehension and the not in operator. This will create a new list that contains all the elements in list1 that are not present in list2.

3. Finally, print the result list to verify that it contains all the elements from list1 that are not in list2.

Here's the Python code that implements these steps:

"""

def remove_elements(list1, list2):
    result = [x for x in list1 if x not in list2]
    return result

print(remove_elements([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], [2, 4, 6, 8]))

"""
This will output the following result:

[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10]

As you can see, the function remove_elements() takes two lists as input and returns a new list that contains all the elements from the first list that are not present in the second list. In this case, the function removes the elements 2, 4, 6, and 8 from the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] and returns the result [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10].
