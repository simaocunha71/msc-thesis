```
def remove_elements(list1, list2):
    return [i for i in list1 if i not in list2]
```

Explanation:

This function utilizes list comprehension to create a new list that contains all elements in `list1` that are not present in `list2`. By iterating through `list1` and only including elements that are not in `list2`, the function effectively removes all elements from `list1` that are present in `list2`.

The assert statement provided serves as a test case to ensure the function is working correctly. It verifies that when `remove_elements` is called with `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]` as `list1` and `[2, 4, 6, 8]` as `list2`, the returned value is `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10]`. This confirms that the function is correctly removing all elements from `list1` that are present in `list2`.

Overall, this solution provides a concise and efficient approach to remove elements from a given list based on the presence of those elements in another list.

```python
def remove_elements(list1, list2):
    return [i for i in list1 if i not in list2]
```

This function is straightforward to understand and implement. It uses list comprehension, a powerful feature of Python, to create a new list that only includes elements from `list1` that are not present in `list2`. By iterating through `list1` and checking if each element is not in `list2`, the function effectively removes all elements from `list1` that are present in `list2`.

The time complexity of this function is O(n*m), where n is the length of `list1` and m is the length of `list2`. This is because for each element in `list1`, the function checks if it is in `list2`. The space complexity is O(n) as a new list is created to store the elements that are not in `list2`.

Overall, this solution provides an efficient and concise approach to remove elements from a given list based
