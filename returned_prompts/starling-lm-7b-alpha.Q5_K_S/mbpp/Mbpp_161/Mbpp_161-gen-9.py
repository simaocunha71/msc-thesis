def remove_elements(list1, list2):

# Test
assert remove_elements([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], [2, 4, 6, 8]) == [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10]

"""
The function remove_elements takes two lists as parameters, list1 and list2. It iterates through the elements in list2 and removes each element from list1 using the remove() method. Finally, it returns the updated list1. However, this implementation will not work correctly because the remove() method modifies the list in place, but it does not update the reference to the original list1. Therefore, the returned list will not contain the correct elements.

To solve this problem, you can use a while loop to remove elements from list1 as long as they are present in list2. Here's an example of a correct implementation:

def remove_elements(list1, list2):
    while list2:
        element = list2.pop()
        while element in list1:
            list1.remove(element)
    return list1

This implementation uses a while loop to repeatedly remove elements from list2 and list1 until there are no more elements in list2. The outer while loop runs as long as list2 is not empty. Inside the loop, it pops an element from list2 and then removes all occurrences of that element from list1 using a while loop. Once all elements in list2 have been removed from list1, the function returns the updated list1. This implementation ensures that the correct elements are removed from list1 and the reference to the original list1 is updated.

# Correct Solution:
def remove_elements(list1, list2):
    while list2:
        element = list2.pop()
        while element in list1:
            list1.remove(element)
    return list1

# Test
assert remove_elements([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], [2, 4
