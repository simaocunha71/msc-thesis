```python
def remove_elements(lst, sub_lst):
    return [x for x in lst if x not in sub_lst]
```

Explanation:
The provided Python code defines a function called `remove_elements` that takes in two lists as parameters: `lst` and `sub_lst`. 

The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element `x` in the `lst`. For each element, it checks if `x` is not present in the `sub_lst`. If the condition is true, `x` is added to a new list.

Finally, the function returns the new list containing all elements from the original list that are not present in the sublist.

The provided assertion demonstrates an example usage of the `remove_elements` function. It checks if the function correctly removes all elements from the `lst` that are present in the `sub_lst`. The expected output is `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10]`.

By using this function, you can remove elements from a list that are present in another list.

For example, if you have a list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]` and you want to remove all elements that are present in the list `[2, 4, 6, 8]`, you can call the `remove_elements` function like this: `remove_elements([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], [2, 4, 6, 8])`. The function will return `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10]`, which is the original list with the specified elements removed.

This can be useful in scenarios where you want to filter or modify a list based on the presence or absence of certain elements in another list.

It's worth noting that the function uses a set to check if an element is present in the sublist, which is generally faster than using a list. However, if you're working with large lists, you might consider optimizing the function further by using more efficient data structures or algorithms.
