"""
The function divisible_by_digits(startnum, endnum) checks if every number within the range from startnum to endnum is divisible by every digit it contains. 
To solve the problem, it defines an inner function divisible(num) that checks if a given number num is divisible by all the digits it contains. The function does this by iterating over each digit in the string representation of the number and checking if the number is divisible by the digit. If the number is not divisible by any of the digits, the function returns False. Otherwise, it returns True. 
The outer function divisible_by_digits(startnum, endnum) then uses a list comprehension to iterate over the range from startnum to endnum and selects only the numbers for which divisible(num) returns True. These numbers are collected in a list and returned as the result of the function. 
The provided assertion checks if the function divisible_by_digits(1, 22) correctly returns the list of all numbers within the range from 1 to 22 that are divisible by all of their digits.

The function printAllFactors(n) prints all factors of a given number n. 
To solve the problem, the function uses a while loop to iterate from 1 to n. Inside the loop, it checks if the current iteration value i is a factor of n by using the modulo operator (%). If the remainder of n divided by i is 0, it means that i is a factor of
