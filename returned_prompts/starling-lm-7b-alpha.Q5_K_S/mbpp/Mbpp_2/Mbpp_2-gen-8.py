To solve this problem, you can use the built-in Python set data structure. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Define a function called similar_elements that takes two lists as parameters. This function will return a set of the shared elements.

2. Create an empty set called result. This set will hold the shared elements.

3. Use the intersection() method to find the shared elements between the two input lists. This method returns a new set that is the intersection of the two sets.

4. Add the result of the intersection() method to the result set using the update() method. This will update the result set with the shared elements.

5. Finally, return the result set.

Here's the Python code that implements the solution:
"""

def similar_elements(list1, list2):
    result = set()
    result.update(set(list1).intersection(set(list2)))
    return result

# Testing the function
assert set(similar_elements((3, 4, 5, 6),(5, 7, 4, 10))) == set((4, 5))

# Explanation of the code
# The intersection() method returns a new set that is the intersection of the two sets. It takes the set of elements from list1 and the set of elements from list2, and returns a set that contains only the elements that are in both sets.
# The update() method adds the shared elements from the intersection() method to the result set. It modifies the result set in place, so there's no need to assign the result of the update() method to a new variable.
# The assert statement is used to verify that the function is working correctly. It compares the result of the function with the expected result, and if they are not equal, it raises an AssertionError exception. In this case, the expected result is a set containing the shared elements (4, 5), and the actual result is the same set.

# The intersection() and update() methods are part of the set data structure in Python. They are used to manipulate sets and find common elements between sets.
# The intersection() method returns a new set that is the intersection of the two sets. It is a set method, so it must be called on a set
