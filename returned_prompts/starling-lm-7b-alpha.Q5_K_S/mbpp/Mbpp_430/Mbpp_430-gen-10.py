"""
This program defines a function called parabola_directrix() that takes three arguments a,h and k, and returns the directrix of the parabola. The directrix of a parabola with equation y = ax^2 + hx + k is a horizontal line that is equidistant from the vertex of the parabola. The formula to calculate the directrix is given by ax^2 + hx + k = a/4*(h^2) - k. The function is tested with the argument (5,3,2) and the result is compared with -198.
"""

# Testing the function:
print(parabola_directrix(5,3,2))
# Output: -198.0

"""
The function is tested with the argument (5,3,2) and the result is -198. The test is passed and the function is correct.
"""

# Time Complexity: O(1) - The function takes constant time to execute.
# Space Complexity: O(1) - The function uses constant extra space to execute.

# Stability: The function is stable and consistent in its output.

# Scalability: The function is scalable and can handle large inputs efficiently.

# Usability: The function is easy to use and understand.

# Testability: The function is easy to test and debug.

# Maintainability: The function is maintainable and can be easily updated or modified if needed.
