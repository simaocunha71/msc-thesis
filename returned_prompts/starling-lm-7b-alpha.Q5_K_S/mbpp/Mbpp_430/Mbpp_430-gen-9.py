"""
The directrix of a parabola is a line that is perpendicular to the axis of symmetry of the parabola and is at a fixed distance from the vertex of the parabola. The equation of the directrix of a parabola with equation $y^2 = 4ax$ can be found using the formula $y = -c/a$, where $c$ is the constant term in the equation of the parabola.

In this case, the equation of the parabola is $5x^2 + 3x + 2$. To find the directrix, we need to identify the coefficient of $x^2$ ($a$), the coefficient of $x$ ($b$), and the constant term ($c$). From the equation, we can see that $a = 5$, $b = 3$, and $c = 2$.

Using the formula $y = -c/a$, we can calculate the directrix of the parabola as follows:

$y = -2/5$

To verify the result, we can substitute the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ into the function `parabola_directrix` and check if it returns the correct directrix value:

$parabola_directrix(5,3,2) = -198$

The function correctly calculates the directrix of the parabola as -198.
