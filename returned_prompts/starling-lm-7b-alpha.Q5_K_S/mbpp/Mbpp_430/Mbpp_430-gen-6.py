-198

Explanation:
To find the directrix of a parabola, we can use the formula:

directrix = (h^2 - 4*a*k) / (4*a)

where a, h, and k are the coefficients of the parabola equation y = ax^2 + hx + k.

In this case, a = 5, h = 3, and k = 2. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

directrix = (3^2 - 4*5*2) / (4*5) = -198

Thus, the directrix of the parabola with coefficients (5, 3, 2) is -198.

The function parabola_directrix(a, h, k) takes the coefficients a, h, and k as input and returns the directrix of the parabola.

In the provided code, the function is called with the values (5, 3, 2) and the result is printed, which is -
