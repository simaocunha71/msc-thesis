Given a parabola in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c, where a â‰  0, and a directrix of the parabola, find the equation of the directrix. The directrix of a parabola is a horizontal line that is parallel to the axis of symmetry of the parabola. The distance between the vertex of the parabola and the directrix is equal to the distance between the focus of the parabola and the vertex of the parabola.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to find the equation of the directrix of a parabola.

1. Find the vertex of the parabola. The vertex of a parabola in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c is given by the point (h, k), where h = -b/2a and k = c - b^2/4a. In this case, h = -b/2a and k = c - b^2/4a.

2. The equation of the directrix is given by y = k - 1/4a.

3. Substitute the values of h and k in the equation of the directrix to obtain the equation of the directrix.
