# Here's a step-by-step guide:

# First, we define the function `parabola_directrix` that takes in three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`. These parameters represent the coefficients of the parabola's equation in the form `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`.

# Inside the function, we calculate the directrix of the parabola using the formula `x = -b/2a`. This formula gives us the x-coordinate of the directrix.

# Finally, we return the calculated x-coordinate of the directrix.

# To test the function, we use the `assert` statement to check if the result of `parabola_directrix(5,3,2)` is equal to `-198`. If the assertion is true, the test passes and the function correctly calculates the directrix of the parabola.

# Note: The `assert` statement is used to check if a condition is true. If the condition is false, an error is raised. In this case, we are using it to check if the calculated directrix is equal to the expected value.

# Here's an example of how to use the function:

# parabola_directrix(5,3,2)  # Returns -198
"""

"""

# In this example, we pass the values `5`, `3`, and `2` as arguments to the `parabola_directrix` function. The function then calculates the directrix of the parabola and returns the result, which is `-198`.

# You can replace the values `5`, `3`, and `2` with any other values to calculate the directrix of a different parabola.
