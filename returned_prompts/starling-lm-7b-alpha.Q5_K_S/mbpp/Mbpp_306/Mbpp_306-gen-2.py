Here's a Python function that solves the problem:

```python
def max_sum_increasing_subseq(nums, i, k):
    n = len(nums)

    # DP table to store maximum sum of increasing subsequence until ith index
    dp = [0] * n
    for j in range(n):
        if j == 0 or nums[j] > nums[j-1]:
            dp[j] = nums[j]
        else:
            dp[j] = max(dp[j-1], nums[j])

    # Find maximum sum of increasing subsequence including kth element
    max_sum = 0
    for j in range(n):
        if j == i:
            continue
        elif nums[j] == k:
            max_sum = max(max_sum, dp[j] + k)
        elif nums[j] < k:
            max_sum = max(max_sum, dp[j])

    return max_sum
```

To test the function with the provided example:

```python
print(max_sum_increasing_subseq([1, 101, 2, 3, 100, 4, 5], 7, 4))  # Output: 11
```

The function works by first creating a DP table to store the maximum sum of increasing subsequence until the ith index. It iterates through the array, comparing each number with its previous number. If the current number is greater than the previous number, it adds the current number to the DP table. Otherwise, it adds the maximum value from the DP table and the current number.

Then, the function finds the maximum sum of increasing subsequence that includes the kth element. It iterates through the array again and checks if the current number is equal to the kth element. If so, it adds the maximum sum of increasing subsequence before the current number to the kth element. If the current number is less than the kth element, it adds the maximum sum of increasing subsequence before the current number to the function's maximum sum.

Finally, the function returns the maximum sum of increasing subsequence
