Here's a Python solution using a dynamic programming approach:

```python
def max_sum_increasing_subseq(nums, i, k):
    # Initialize the dp table
    dp = [0] * len(nums)
    # Initialize the maximum sum of increasing subsequence at index i
    dp[i] = nums[i]
    # Initialize the maximum sum of increasing subsequence at index k
    dp[k] = nums[k]

    # Iterate through the indices from i+1 to k-1
    for j in range(i+1, k):
        # Find the maximum sum of increasing subsequence at index j
        dp[j] = max(dp[j-1], nums[j] + dp[j-1])

    # Return the maximum sum of increasing subsequence from prefix until ith index and including a given kth element
    return dp[k]
```

You can use the `max_sum_increasing_subseq` function by passing in the `nums` list, the index `i`, and the index `k`. The function will return the maximum sum of increasing subsequence from prefix until the ith index and including the kth element.

For example, if you call `max_sum_increasing_subseq([1, 101, 2, 3, 100, 4, 5], 7, 4)`, it will return `11` as the maximum sum of increasing subsequence from prefix until the 7th index (i.e., 2) and including the 4th element (i.e., 100).

```python
assert max_sum_increasing_subseq([1, 101, 2, 3, 100, 4, 5], 7, 4) == 11
```

This assertion confirms that the `max_sum_increasing_subseq` function is correctly calculating the maximum sum of increasing subsequence as expected.
