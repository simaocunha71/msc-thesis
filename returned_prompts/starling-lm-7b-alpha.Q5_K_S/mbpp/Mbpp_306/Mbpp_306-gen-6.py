The following is one approach to solve this problem:

We can use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. Define a function called `max_sum_increasing_subseq` that takes three parameters: `arr`, `i`, and `k`. `arr` is the input array, `i` is the index of the prefix, and `k` is the index of the `kth` element which is after `i`.

2. Create a variable called `dp` to store the maximum sum of the increasing subsequence. Initialize `dp` as an empty list with the length of `arr`.

3. Create a variable called `max_sum` to store the maximum sum of the increasing subsequence up to the `i`th index. Initialize `max_sum` as 0.

4. Use a while loop to iterate through `arr` starting from index `i` until the end of the array. While iterating, check if the current element is greater than the previous element. If it is, update `max_sum` by adding the current element to it. If it's not, update `max_sum` by assigning the current element to it. Also, update `dp` at index `k` by assigning `max_sum` to it.

5. After the while loop, return the value at index `k` in `dp`. This will be the maximum sum of the increasing subsequence from the prefix until the `i`th index, including the `kth` element.

6. Test the function by calling `max_sum_increasing_subseq` with the input `[1, 101, 2, 3, 100, 4, 5]`, `7` as the `i`th index, and `4` as the `kth` index. Assert that the result is `11`.

Here's the code for the above approach:

```python
def max_sum_increasing_subseq(arr, i, k):
    dp = [0] * len(arr)
    max_sum = 0
    for j in range(i, len(arr)):
        if arr[j] > arr[j-
