```
def sort_sublists(l):
    for i in range(len(l)):
        l[i].sort()
    return l
```

Explanation:

To solve the problem, we can define a function called `sort_sublists` which takes a list of lists, `l`, as an input. Inside the function, we use a for loop to iterate through each sublist in the given list of lists. For each sublist, we use the `sort()` method to sort the strings in ascending order. Finally, we return the modified list of lists.

The provided assert statement verifies that the `sort_sublists` function correctly sorts the sublists of strings in the given list of lists.

Here's an example usage of the `sort_sublists` function:
```python
sorted_list = sort_sublists([["green", "orange"], ["black", "white"], ["white", "black", "orange"]])
print(sorted_list)
```
Output:
```
[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]
```

In this example, the `sort_sublists` function is applied to the list of lists `[["green", "orange"], ["black", "white"], ["white", "black", "orange"]]`. The function sorts each sublist of strings in ascending order, resulting in the output `[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]`.

Note that the `sort_sublists` function modifies the original list of lists in-place. If you want to preserve the original list and return a new sorted list of lists, you can modify the function as follows:
```python
def sort_sublists(l):
    return [sorted(sublist) for sublist in l]
```
This version of the function uses a list comprehension to create a new list of sorted sublists, without modifying the original list.

Overall, the `sort_sublists` function provides a straightforward solution to the problem of sorting each sublist of strings in a given list of lists.
