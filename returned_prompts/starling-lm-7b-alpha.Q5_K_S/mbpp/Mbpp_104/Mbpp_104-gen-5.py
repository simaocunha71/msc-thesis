"""
To sort each sublist in a given list of lists, you can use the built-in Python `sort()` function. The `sort()` function sorts the elements of the sublist in ascending order. Here's how you can define the function:

```python
def sort_sublists(lists):
    for sublist in lists:
        sublist.sort()
    return lists
```

To test the function, you can use the `assert` statement with the expected output:

```python
assert sort_sublists((["green", "orange"], ["black", "white"], ["white", "black", "orange"])) == [['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]
```

This `assert` statement will raise an `AssertionError` if the function does not return the expected result.

The `sort_sublists` function takes a list of lists as an argument and iterates over each sublist in the list. For each sublist, it calls the `sort()` function, which rearranges the elements of the sublist in ascending order. Finally, the function returns the sorted list of lists.

When you run the `assert` statement, it compares the result of calling the `sort_sublists` function with the expected output. If the function returns the correct result, the `assert` statement does nothing and the program continues execution. If the function returns an incorrect result, the `AssertionError` is raised, and an error message is displayed.

In this case, the `sort_sublists` function correctly sorts each sublist in the given list of lists, so the `assert` statement does not raise an error.
