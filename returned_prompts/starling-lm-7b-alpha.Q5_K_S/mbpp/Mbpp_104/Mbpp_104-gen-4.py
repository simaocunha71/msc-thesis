"""
Here's one possible solution:

def sort_sublists(lists):
    for sublist in lists:
        sublist.sort()
    return lists

In this solution, we iterate over each sublist in the input list of lists. For each sublist, we sort it in-place using the built-in list.sort() method. Finally, we return the original list of lists, but with each sublist sorted.

This solution works for the given assertion because it correctly sorts each sublist of strings in the input list of lists. For example, the input (["green", "orange"], ["black", "white"], ["white", "black", "orange"]) will be sorted to [['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']].
