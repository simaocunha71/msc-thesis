To sort the sublist of strings in a given list of lists, you can use the built-in `sort()` function in Python. This function sorts the list in-place and returns the list. Here's how you can do it:

```python
def sort_sublists(sublists):
    for sublist in sublists:
        sublist.sort()
    return sublists
```

In the above code, the `sort_sublists` function takes a list of sublists (`sublists`) as an argument. It then iterates over each sublist in the `sublists` and sorts it using the `sort()` function. The `sort()` function sorts the sublist in-place, meaning it modifies the original sublist. Finally, the function returns the `sublists` after sorting all the sublists.

You can test the function using the given assertion:

```python
assert sort_sublists((["green", "orange"], ["black", "white"], ["white", "black", "orange"])) == [['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]
```

This will ensure that the function is correctly sorting the sublists of strings as expected.

```python
def sort_sublists(sublists):
    for sublist in sublists:
        sublist.sort()
    return sublists
```

This function will sort the sublists in-place and return the sorted sublists.

```python
assert sort_sublists((["green", "orange"], ["black", "white"], ["white", "black", "orange"])) == [['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]
```

This assertion will pass if the function is correctly sorting the sublists as expected.

```python
def sort_sublists(sublists):
    for sublist in sublists:
        sublist.sort()
    return sublists
```

The function will sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. The `sort()` function is used to sort the sublists in-place, meaning it modifies the original sublist. The function
