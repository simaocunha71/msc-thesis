# Here, we define a function called diff_even_odd that takes a list as input. We create an empty list called l. We iterate over each element in the input list. If an element is divisible by 2 and equal to 0, we append it to the list l. If an element is not divisible by 2 and not equal to 0, we append it to the list l and break the loop. After the loop, we check if the length of l is equal to 2. If it is, we return the difference between the second and first elements in l. Otherwise, we return a message stating that the given list does not have an even or odd number.

# For example, if we call diff_even_odd([1,3,5,7,4,1,6,8]), the function will iterate over the list and find the first even number (4) and the first odd number (1). It will return the difference between these two numbers, which is 3.

# If we call diff_even_odd([1,3,5,7]), the function will not find an even or odd number in the list, so it will return the message "The given list does not have an even or odd number".

# The function can be used to find the difference between the first even and first odd number in any given list.






# Here are some test cases to verify the correctness of the function:


assert diff_even_odd([1,3,5,7,4,1,6,8])==3
assert diff_even_odd([1,3,5,7])=="The given list does not have an even or odd number"
assert diff_even_odd([1,3,5,7,4,1,6,
