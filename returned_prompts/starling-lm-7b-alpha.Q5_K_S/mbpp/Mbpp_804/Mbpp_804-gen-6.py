"""
Explanation:
This is a simple problem that can be solved by checking if the product of the numbers in the list is divisible by 2.
"""


# Alternative method:
def is_product_even(lst):
    return any(i % 2 == 0 for i in lst)


# Test
assert is_product_even([1,2,3])
assert not is_product_even([1,2,3,5])


"""
Explanation:
This method directly checks if any of the numbers in the list is even, which is equivalent to checking if the product of the numbers is even, because if any of the numbers is even, the product of the numbers is even.
