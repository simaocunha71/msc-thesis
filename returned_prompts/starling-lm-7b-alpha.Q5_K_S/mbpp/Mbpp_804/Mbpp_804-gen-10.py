Explanation:
To check if the product of numbers in a list is even, you can multiply all the numbers together. If the result is divisible by 2, then the product is even. The function `is_product_even` iterates through the `numbers` list and multiplies each number by a running product. If any number in the list is odd, the result will be odd. The function returns True if the product is even, and False if it's odd.

In the example provided, `is_product_even([1,2,3])` is called, which multiplies the numbers 1, 2, and 3 together. The result, 6, is an even number, so the function returns True.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

- The function `is_product_even` takes a list of numbers as an argument.
- It initializes a variable `product` to 1, which will store the product of all the numbers in the list.
- The function then iterates through each number in the `numbers` list using a for loop.
- Inside the loop, the current number is multiplied by the `product` variable, and the result is assigned back to `product`.
- After the loop finishes, the function checks if the `product` is divisible by 2 using the modulo operator `%`. If the remainder is 0, the product is even, and the function returns True. Otherwise, the product is odd, and the function returns False.

Overall, this function effectively checks if the product of numbers in a list is even by multiplying all the numbers together and checking the remainder when divided by 2.

To use the function, you can simply call `is_product_even` with a list of numbers as an argument. The function will return True if the product is even, and False if it's odd.

For example, `is_product_even([
