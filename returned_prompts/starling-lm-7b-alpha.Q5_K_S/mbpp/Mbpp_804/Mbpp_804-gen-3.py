"""
Here is a function that checks whether the product of numbers in a list is even or not:

def is_product_even(nums):
    return all(i % 2 == 0 for i in nums)
"""

Here's an explanation of the solution:

The function `is_product_even` takes a list of numbers as input.

It uses a generator expression `(i % 2 == 0 for i in nums)` to create a generator object that yields `True` for each even number in the list and `False` for each odd number.

The `all()` function is then used to check if all the values generated by the generator expression are `True`. If all the numbers in the list are even, the `all()` function will return `True`, indicating that the product of the numbers is even. Otherwise, it will return `False`.

To test the function, you can use the `assert` statement like this:

assert is_product_even([1,2,3])  # This will raise an `AssertionError` because the product of the numbers is not even.

This assertion will fail because the product of the numbers `[1, 2, 3]` is not even. The function correctly identifies this and returns `False`. 

You can modify the list of numbers passed to the function to test different scenarios and verify if the function correctly determines whether the product of the numbers is even or not.

# You can modify the list of numbers passed to the function to test different scenarios and verify if the function correctly determines whether the product of the numbers is even or not.

# Here are some more examples to test the function:

assert is_product_even([2,4,6])  # This should return `True` because the product of the numbers is even.
assert is_product_even([1,3,5])  # This should return `False` because the product of the numbers is not even.
