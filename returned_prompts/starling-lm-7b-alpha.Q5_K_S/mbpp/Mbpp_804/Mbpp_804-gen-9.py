Explanation:

The function `is_product_even` takes a list of numbers as input and checks whether the product of all the numbers is even or not. If the product of all the numbers in the list is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

In the implementation, we start by initializing a variable `p` to 1. Then, we iterate through each number in the input list `nums` and multiply it with `p`. After iterating through all the numbers, we check whether the product `p` is divisible by 2 using the modulo operator `%`. If the product is divisible by 2 without any remainder, it means the product is even, and we return `True`; otherwise, we return `False`. 

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input list `nums`. This is because we need to iterate through each number in the list once.

The space complexity of this function is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra memory to store the variable `p`.

Overall, this function provides a simple and efficient way to determine whether the product of numbers in a list is even or not.

```python
def test_is_product_even():
    assert is_product_even([1, 2, 3]) == True
    assert is_product_even([1, 3, 5]) == False
```

In the provided test cases, we verify that the function correctly identifies whether the product of numbers in the given list is even or not. The first test case `[1, 2, 3]` should return `True` because the product of the numbers is 6, which is even. The second test case `[1, 3, 5]` should return `False` because the product of the numbers is 15, which is not even. 

By running these test cases, we can ensure that the `is_product_even
