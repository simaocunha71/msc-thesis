Here's a solution to your problem:

def is_product_even(nums):
    return len([i for i in nums if i % 2 == 0]) > 0

Explanation:
In the above code, we are using list comprehension to create a list of all the numbers from the input list, nums, that are divisible by 2. This list comprehension, [i for i in nums if i % 2 == 0], will return a list of all the even numbers in the input list. If the length of this list is greater than 0, it means that the product of all the even numbers in the input list is even, since the product of even numbers is even.
"""

```python
def is_product_even(nums):
    return len([i for i in nums if i % 2 == 0]) > 0
```

You can test the function with the provided assert statement:

```python
assert is_product_even([1,2,3])
```

This will return True, since there is at least one even number in the list [1,2,3], which is 2.

```python
>>> is_product_even([1,2,3])
True
```

You can try it with other lists as well:

```python
>>> is_product_even([1,3,5])
False
```

In this case, the function will return False, since there are no even numbers in the list [1,3,5].

This solution provides a simple and efficient way to check whether the product of numbers in a list is even or not, using Python's list comprehension feature.
