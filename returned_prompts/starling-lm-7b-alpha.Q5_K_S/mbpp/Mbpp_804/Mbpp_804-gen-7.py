```
def is_product_even(numbers):
    product = 1
    for n in numbers:
        product *= n
    return product % 2 == 0
```

Explanation:

To determine whether the product of the numbers in a list is even or not, you can calculate the product and check if it is divisible by 2. If it is divisible by 2, then it is even, otherwise it is odd.

In the provided solution, the function `is_product_even` takes a list of numbers as input. It initializes a variable `product` to 1, which will be used to store the product of all the numbers in the list. Then, it iterates through each number in the list and multiplies it with the `product` variable. Finally, it checks if the product is divisible by 2 using the modulo operator (`%`). If the remainder is 0, then the product is even and the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

To test the function, you can use the `assert` statement along with the `is_product_even` function and a list of numbers. For example, `assert is_product_even([1,2,3])` checks if the product of the numbers 1, 2, and 3 is even, and if it is, the assertion passes and no error is raised.

Overall, this solution provides a simple and efficient way to determine whether the product of a list of numbers is even or not.

```python
def is_product_even(numbers):
    product = 1
    for n in numbers:
        product *= n
    return product % 2 == 0
```

This code defines a function called `is_product_even` that takes a list of numbers as input. It initializes a variable `product` to 1, which will be used to store the product of all the numbers in the list. Then, it iterates through each number in the list and multiplies it with the `product` variable. Finally, it checks if the product is divisible by 2 using the modulo operator (`%`). If the remainder is 0, then the product is even and the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.
