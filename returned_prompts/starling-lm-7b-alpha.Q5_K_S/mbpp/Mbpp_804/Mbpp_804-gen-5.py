```
def is_product_even(num_list):
    return any(i % 2 == 0 for i in num_list)
```

Explanation:
The function is_product_even checks whether the product of numbers in a list is even or not. It does so by using the any() function in Python, which returns True if at least one element of the iterable (in this case, the list of numbers) is True. The any() function is used in conjunction with a generator expression that checks if each number in the list is even (i.e., divisible by 2). If any number in the list is even, the any() function will return True, indicating that the product of the numbers is even. Otherwise, it will return False.

To test the function, you can use the assert statement followed by a function call with a specific example, like assert is_product_even([1,2,3]). This will raise an AssertionError if the function does not correctly determine whether the product of the numbers in the list is even or not.

Overall, the function is_product_even provides a concise and efficient way to determine whether the product of numbers in a list is even or not, using the any() function and a generator expression in Python.
