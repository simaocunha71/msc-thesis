"""
The above code defines a function called rectangle_area that takes in two parameters: length and width. It calculates and returns the area of the rectangle by multiplying the length and width together. The assert statement is used to verify that the function returns the expected result for the given input (length=10, width=20).

To use the function, you can call it with the desired length and width values, like rectangle_area(10, 20). The function will return the area of the rectangle, which can be stored in a variable or printed directly.

In the provided assert statement, the expected result is hardcoded as 200. This means that if the function returns a value other than 200 for the given input (length=10, width=20), the assertion will fail and an error message will be raised.

```python
def rectangle_area(length, width):
    return length*width
```
This function calculates the area of a rectangle using the formula length * width. It takes in two parameters: length and width. The function body simply multiplies the length and width together and returns the result.

To use this function, you can call it with the desired length and width values, like `rectangle_area(10, 20)`. The function will return the area of the rectangle, which can be stored in a variable or printed directly.

For example, if you call `rectangle_area(10, 20)`, the function will return `200` as the area of the rectangle. You can then use this value as needed in your program.

The provided assert statement is a way to verify that the function is working correctly. It checks if the function returns the expected result for the given input (length=10, width=20), which is `200`. If the function returns a value other than `200` for these input values, the assertion will fail and an error message will be raised.

This helps ensure that the function is correctly calculating the area of a rectangle, and can be a
