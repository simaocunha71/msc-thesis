def rectangle_area(length, width):
    """
    Finds the area of a rectangle

    Parameters:
    length (int): the length of the rectangle
    width (int): the width of the rectangle

    Returns:
    int: the area of the rectangle

"""
The area of a rectangle can be calculated by multiplying the length by the width. The function rectangle_area takes two parameters, length and width, both of which are integers. It returns an integer, which is the area of the rectangle.

The function uses a simple multiplication operation to calculate the area of the rectangle. The length and width parameters are multiplied together to give the area.

The function can be tested with the assert statement. In this case, the function is tested to see if it correctly calculates the area of a rectangle with a length of 10 and a width of 20. The expected result is 200, and the actual result is also 200, so the assertion passes.
