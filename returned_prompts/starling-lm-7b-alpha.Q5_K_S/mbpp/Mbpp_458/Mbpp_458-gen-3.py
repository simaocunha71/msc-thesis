Explanation:
The code defines a function called `rectangle_area` that takes two arguments: `length` and `width`. Inside the function, it multiplies the length and width together to calculate the area of the rectangle. The function then returns the calculated area. 

To test the function, the code includes an assertion that checks if the function correctly calculates the area of a rectangle with a length of 10 and width of 20. The expected result is 200, and the assertion checks if the actual result matches the expected result. 

The assertion is a way to ensure that the function is working correctly. If the actual result does not match the expected result, an error will be raised. 

In this case, the assertion passes, indicating that the `rectangle_area` function correctly calculates the area of a rectangle.

Overall, this code provides a function to calculate the area of a rectangle and includes a test to verify its correctness.
