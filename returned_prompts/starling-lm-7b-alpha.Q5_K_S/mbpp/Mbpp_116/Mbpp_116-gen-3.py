Explanation:

The `tuple_to_int` function takes a tuple of positive integers as input and returns a single integer as output. It does this by first converting each integer in the tuple to a string using the `map` function and the `str` function. Then, it joins all the strings together using the `join` method of the string class. Finally, it converts the resulting string back into an integer using the `int` function.

The `map` function is used to apply the `str` function to each element of the tuple. The `join` method is used to concatenate all the strings together. The `int` function is used to convert the resulting string back into an integer.

To test the function, the `assert` statement is used to verify that the function correctly converts the tuple `(1, 2, 3)` into the integer `123`.

The time complexity of this function is O(n) because it iterates through each element in the tuple once. The space complexity is also O(n) because it creates a new string that is the concatenation of all the elements in the tuple.

Overall, this function provides a simple and efficient way to convert a tuple of positive integers into a single integer in Python.

Here is an example of how to use the function:

```python
print(tuple_to_int((1, 2, 3)))  # Output: 123
```

This will print the result of calling the `tuple_to_int` function with the tuple `(1, 2, 3)`, which should be `123`.

In addition, the function can handle tuples with more than three elements, such as `(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)`. For example:

```python
print(tuple_to_int((
