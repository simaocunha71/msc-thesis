"""
The function remove_length takes in a string and a number k as inputs. It uses the split() function to separate the string into a list of words. It then loops through each word in the list and checks if the length of the word is equal to k. If the length of the word is not equal to k, it adds the word to the result list. Finally, it joins the words in the result list back into a string using the join() function and returns the modified string. The assert statement is used to verify that the function correctly removes all the words with a length of 3 from the given string.
