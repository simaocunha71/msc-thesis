Here is a Python function that uses Shell Sort to sort a given array:

```python
def shell_sort(arr):
    gap = len(arr) // 2
    while gap > 0:
        for i in range(gap, len(arr)):
            temp = arr[i]
            j = i
            while j >= gap and arr[j - gap] > temp:
                arr[j] = arr[j - gap]
                j -= gap
            arr[j] = temp
        gap //= 2
    return arr
```

You can use the `assert` statement to test the function's output against the expected output:

```python
assert shell_sort([12, 23, 4, 5, 3, 2, 12, 81, 56, 95]) == [2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 12, 23, 56, 81, 95]
```

The `shell_sort` function works by repeatedly splitting the array into sub-arrays and sorting each sub-array. It starts with a gap size equal to half the length of the array and decreases the gap size by half in each iteration. It then compares and swaps elements to move them to their correct positions in the sorted sub-array. This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted.

The `assert` statement is used to check if the function's output matches the expected output. If the outputs do not match, an AssertionError will be raised, indicating that the function is not working correctly.

Overall, this function uses Shell Sort algorithm to sort the given array and provides a way to verify its correctness using the `assert` statement.

```python
def shell_sort(arr):
    gap = len(arr) // 2
    while gap > 0:
        for i in range(gap, len(arr)):
            temp = arr[i]
            j = i
            while j >= gap and arr[j - gap] > temp:
                arr[j] = arr[j - gap]
                j -= gap
            arr[j] = temp
        gap //
