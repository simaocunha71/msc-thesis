Here's one way to implement the shell sort algorithm in Python:

```python
def shell_sort(arr):
    # Start with a big gap, then reduce the gap
    gap = len(arr) // 2
    while gap > 0:
        # Do a gapped insertion sort for this gap size.
        for i in range(gap, len(arr)):
            # add a[i] to the elements that have been gap sorted
            temp = arr[i]
            # shift earlier gap-sorted elements up until the correct location
            j = i
            while j >= gap and arr[j - gap] > temp:
                arr[j] = arr[j - gap]
                j -= gap
            # put temp (the original a[i]) in its correct location
            arr[j] = temp
        # reduce the gap
        gap //= 2
    return arr
```

To use this function, you can simply call `shell_sort` and pass in your array as an argument. The function will return the sorted array. In this case, the assert statement `assert shell_sort([12, 23, 4, 5, 3, 2, 12, 81, 56, 95]) == [2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 12, 23, 56, 81, 95]` checks whether the function correctly sorts the given array.

Here's an explanation of the code:

- The `shell_sort` function takes an array `arr` as an argument.
- It starts with a gap size of `len(arr) // 2`, which is the initial gap size.
- Inside the while loop, it performs a gapped insertion sort for the current gap size. This is done using a nested for loop.
- The outer for loop iterates over each element in the array starting from the gap size.
- The inner while loop shifts the earlier gap-sorted elements to the right until the correct location for the current element is found. It compares the current element with the elements in the gap-sorted portion of the array and moves them up if they are greater.
- Once the correct location for the current
