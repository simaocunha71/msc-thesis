Here's one way to do it:

```python
def shell_sort(arr):
    gap = len(arr) // 2
    while gap > 0:
        for i in range(gap, len(arr)):
            temp = arr[i]
            j = i
            while j >= gap and arr[j - gap] > temp:
                arr[j] = arr[j - gap]
                j -= gap
            arr[j] = temp
        gap //= 2
    return arr
```

This implementation of shell sort works by first setting the initial gap size to half the length of the array. It then enters a loop where it iterates through the array and swaps adjacent elements if they are out of order. The gap size is gradually reduced until it becomes 0, at which point the array is sorted.

For example, if we call `shell_sort([12, 23, 4, 5, 3, 2, 12, 81, 56, 95])`, the function will return `[2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 12, 23, 56, 81, 95]`, which is the sorted version of the input array.

This implementation has a time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the array.

```python
def shell_sort(arr):
    gap = len(arr) // 2
    while gap > 0:
        for i in range(gap, len(arr)):
            temp = arr[i]
            j = i
            while j >= gap and arr[j - gap] > temp:
                arr[j] = arr[j - gap]
                j -= gap
            arr[j] = temp
        gap //= 2
    return arr
```

This is one possible solution to the problem. It uses the shell sort algorithm to sort the given array. The algorithm starts with an initial gap size equal to half the length of the array. It then enters a loop where it iterates through the array and swaps adjacent elements if they are out of order. The gap size is gradually reduced until it becomes 0
