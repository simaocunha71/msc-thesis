```
def bell_number(n):
    B = [1, 1] + [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        for j in range(i):
            B[i] += B[j] * B[i - 1 - j]
    return B[n]
```

In this code, we use dynamic programming to solve the problem. We define an array B of size n+1, and initialize the first two elements as 1. Then we iterate through the array from the third element to the nth element. For each element i, we sum the product of B[j] and B[i-1-j] for all j from 0 to i-1. This is because for each partition of the set, there are two possibilities: either include the current element or not include it. If we include it, then the remaining set can be partitioned into j subsets, and if we don't include it, then the remaining set can be partitioned into i-1-j subsets. Hence, we update the value of B[i] by adding the product of B[j] and B[i-1-j] for all j from 0 to i-1. Finally, we return the value of B[n], which represents the number of ways to partition a set of n elements.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2), as we need to iterate through the array and perform a multiplication operation for each element. The space complexity is O(n), as we need to store the values of B in an array of size n+1.

To use this function, you can call it with an integer argument representing the number of elements in the set you want to partition. For example, to find the number of ways to partition a set of 2 elements, you can call `bell_number(2)`, which will return 2.

Note: The Bell number is a sequence of numbers that counts the number of ways to partition a set. The first few Bell numbers are 1, 2, 5, 15, 52, 203, ...

Here are some additional facts about the Bell number:
- The Bell number can be calculated using the Bell triangle, which is a triangular array
