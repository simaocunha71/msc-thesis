Here's one way to do it:

```python
from math import factorial
def bell_number(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return sum(factorial(n) / (factorial(k) * factorial(n - k)) for k in range(n + 1))
```

This function uses the concept of Bell numbers to calculate the number of ways to partition a set of numbers. It starts by checking if the input `n` is 0, in which case it simply returns 1. Otherwise, it uses a loop to iterate over all possible values of `k` from 0 to `n`, and for each `k`, it calculates the factorial of `n` divided by the product of the factorial of `k` and the factorial of `n - k`. The sum of these values is then returned as the result.

To test the function, you can use the `assert` statement to check if the result of `bell_number(2)` is equal to 2, as stated in the problem description.

```python
assert bell_number(2)==2
```

If the assertion passes, it means that the function is correctly calculating the number of ways to partition a set of Bell numbers.

```python
def bell_number(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return sum(factorial(n) / (factorial(k) * factorial(n - k)) for k in range(n + 1))

assert bell_number(2)==2
```

This code defines the `bell_number` function and uses the `assert` statement to check if the result of `bell_number(2)` is equal to 2. If the assertion passes, it means that the function is correctly calculating the number of ways to partition a set of Bell numbers.

```python
def bell_number(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return sum(factorial(n) / (factorial(k) * factorial(n - k)) for k in range(n + 1))

assert bell_number(2)==
