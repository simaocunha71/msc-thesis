In this solution, we use dynamic programming to compute the Bell numbers. We initialize a table `B` to store the results of sub-calculations, and a table `C` to store the results of sub-calculations. We then compute the Bell numbers one by one, using the previous values in the tables to calculate the current value. Finally, we return the Bell number for the input `n`.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested loops in the calculation of the Bell numbers. However, it is a more efficient approach than computing the Bell numbers from scratch, as it reuses previously calculated values.

The function `bell_number` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the Bell number for that input. The function uses the recurrence relation for Bell numbers to calculate the result. The recurrence relation is defined as follows:

- B_0 = 1
- B_1 = 1
- B_n = C_(n-1) + sum(C_j * B_(n-j-1)) for j in range(n-1)

where C_n is the nth Catalan number, defined as C_n = sum(C_j * C_(n-
