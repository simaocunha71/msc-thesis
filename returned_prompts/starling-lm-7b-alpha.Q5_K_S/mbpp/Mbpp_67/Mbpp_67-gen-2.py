Here's a step-by-step solution to the problem:

First, we need to understand what a Bell number is. A Bell number is a number that counts the number of ways to partition a set. For example, the Bell number for the number 2 is 2, because there are two ways to partition the set {1, 2} (either {1} and {2} or {2} and {1}).

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We can create a table to store the number of ways to partition a set with a given number of elements. We can initialize the table with the base case: the number of ways to partition a set with 0 or 1 element is 1.

Then, we can iterate through the table and fill in the remaining values using the following formula:

b(n) = b(n-1) + b(n-2) + ... + b(1)

This formula is derived from the Bell triangle, which is a triangular array of numbers that counts the number of ways to partition a set with a given number of elements.

Finally, we can return the value at the table entry corresponding to the desired Bell number.

Here's a Python implementation of this approach:

```python
def bell_number(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    bell_table = [0] * (n + 1)
    bell_table[0] = 1
    bell_table[1] = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        for j in range(i):
            bell_table[i] += bell_table[j]
    return bell_table[n]
```

You can use this function to find the number of ways to partition a set of Bell numbers. For example, `bell_number(2)` returns 2.

```python
print(bell_number(2))  # Output: 2
```

This solution uses a dynamic programming approach to efficiently calculate the Bell number for a given set of elements.

```python
def bell_number(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
