Explanation:

The Bell number is the number of ways to partition a set of n elements. It is denoted by B(n) and can be defined by the exponential Bell triangle, which is constructed by applying Bell triangle rules to the rows and columns of Pascal's triangle.

The Bell numbers can be calculated using the following recurrence relation:

B(n) = sum(B(i-1)) for i in range(1, n+1)

The function bell_number(n) calculates the nth Bell number using this recurrence relation. It initializes a list b with the first two Bell numbers (1, 1) and then iterates from 2 to n, calculating each Bell number by summing the previous Bell numbers and adding 1. The function returns the nth Bell number.

For example, bell_number(2) returns 2, which is the number of ways to partition a set of 2 elements.

```python
print(bell_number(2))  # Output: 2
```

This function can be used to find the number of ways to partition a set of Bell numbers, as requested in the problem statement.

```python
# Test cases
assert bell_number(2) == 2
assert bell_number(3) == 5
assert bell_number(4) == 15
```

These test cases verify that the function correctly calculates the Bell numbers for different values of n.

```python
# Time complexity: O(n^2)
# Space complexity: O(n)
```

The time complexity of the function is O(n^2) because the recurrence relation requires summing over all previous Bell numbers. The space complexity is O(n) because the function uses a list to store the Bell numbers.

Overall, the function is an efficient solution to find the number of ways to partition a set of Bell numbers.
