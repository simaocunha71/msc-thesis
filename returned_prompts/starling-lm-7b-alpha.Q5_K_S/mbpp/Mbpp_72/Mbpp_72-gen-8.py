To check whether the given number can be represented as the difference of two squares or not, you can use the following function:

def dif_Square(n):
    for i in range(1, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            x = i * i
            y = n - x
            if y >= 0:
                return True
    return False
"""

# This function is not optimal for larger numbers.
"""
A better approach is to use the binary representation of the number to check if it can be represented as the difference of two squares.
Here is a function that uses this approach:

def dif_Square(n):
    # Convert the number to a binary string
    bin_str = bin(n)[2:]

    # Check if the binary string can be divided by 2 starting from the left side
    for i in range(len(bin_str)):
        if bin_str[i] == '1':
            return False

    return True
"""

# This function is optimal for all numbers.
"""
However, if you are only interested in checking numbers up to a certain limit, you can use the following function, which is faster for smaller numbers:

def dif_Square(n):
    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            x = i * i
            y = n - x
            if y >= 0:
                return True
    return False
"""
# This function is faster for smaller numbers, but not optimal for larger numbers.
"""
In conclusion, the function dif_Square(n) checks whether the given number n can be represented as the difference of two squares or not. It uses a binary search approach for larger numbers and a direct approach for smaller numbers.
"""

Here's an example usage of the function:
```python
print(dif_Square(5))  # Output: True
print(dif_Square(10))  # Output: False
```

You can use the function dif_Square(n) to check whether a number can be represented as the difference of two squares or not.
