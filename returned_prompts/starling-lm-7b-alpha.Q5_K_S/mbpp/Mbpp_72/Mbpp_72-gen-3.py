"""
The difference of two squares is the difference of the squares of their sum and product, which is always a product of two numbers that are either both odd or both even.
"""
"""
The difference of two squares is a number which can be expressed as the difference of two squares. For example, the difference between 81 and 64 is 17, and 17 can be expressed as the difference of 13 and 4 (13^2 and 4^2).
"""

"""
The difference of two squares is always an odd number, because the square of an even number is always even, and the square of an odd number is always odd.
"""

"""
The difference of two squares is always a factor of the square of the difference of the original two numbers.
"""

"""
The difference of two squares is always a composite number, because it can be expressed as the product of two different positive integers.
"""

"""
The difference of two squares is always a perfect square, because it can be expressed as the square of the absolute value of the difference of the original two numbers.
"""

"""
The difference of two squares is always a positive number, because the square of any number is always nonnegative.
"""

"""
The difference of two squares is always a multiple of four, because it can be expressed as the difference of the squares of the sum and product of the original two numbers, and the square of the sum of two numbers is always divisible by four.
"""

"""
The difference of two squares is always a prime number, because it can be expressed as the product of two different prime numbers.
"""

"""
The difference of two squares is always a perfect cube, because it can be expressed as the cube of the absolute value of the difference of the original two numbers.
"""

"""
The difference of two squares is always a perfect number, because it can be expressed as the sum of all the positive integers up to half its value.
