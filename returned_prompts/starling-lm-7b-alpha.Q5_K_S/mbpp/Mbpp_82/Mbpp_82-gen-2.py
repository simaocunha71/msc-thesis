# The above code has a mistake in the function definition. The correct definition should be:

import math

def volume_sphere(radius):
    return 4/3 * math.pi * radius ** 3

# Test
assert math.isclose(volume_sphere(10), 4188.790204786391, rel_tol=0.001)

This code calculates the volume of a sphere using the formula V = 4/3 * π * r³, where r is the radius of the sphere. The math.isclose() function is used to compare the calculated volume with the expected result, ensuring that the relative tolerance is within 0.001. 

To use the function, simply provide the radius of the sphere as an argument. The function will then return the volume of the sphere. 

For example, if you want to calculate the volume of a sphere with a radius of 10, you can call the function like this: volume_sphere(10). The result will be approximately 4188.790204786391, which is the expected result within the specified relative tolerance.

The assert statement at the end of the code is used to verify that the calculated volume is correct. If the calculated volume is not within the specified relative tolerance of the expected result, the assert statement will fail and an error message will be raised.

Overall, this code provides a reliable and accurate way to calculate the volume of a sphere in Python.

Here's a detailed explanation of how the code works:

1. The `import math` statement is used to import the math module, which contains various mathematical functions and constants. In this case, we need the `math.pi` constant and
