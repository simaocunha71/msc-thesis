I would suggest to use the following code:

import math

def volume_sphere(radius):
    return (4/3) * math.pi * (radius ** 3)

The reason is that the original solution has an unnecessary "return" statement and the use of the "math" library is not necessary since the "pi" constant is part of the standard library.

Here's the modified code:

import math

def volume_sphere(radius):
    return (4/3) * math.pi * (radius ** 3)

This code calculates the volume of a sphere given the radius of the sphere. The function uses the formula for the volume of a sphere, which is (4/3) * pi * (radius ** 3). The math.pi constant is used to represent the mathematical constant pi, which is approximately 3.14159.

To use this function, you can pass the radius of the sphere as an argument to the function. The function will then calculate and return the volume of the sphere.

For example, if you want to calculate the volume of a sphere with a radius of 10, you can call the function like this:

volume = volume_sphere(10)
print(volume)

This will output the volume of the sphere, which should be approximately 4188.790204786391, rounded to four decimal places.

It's worth noting that the assert statement in the original solution is used to check if the calculated volume is close to the expected value (4188.790204786391) within a tolerance of 0.001. This is a common practice in testing and debugging code to ensure that the implementation is correct.

Overall, the modified code should provide a more efficient and accurate solution for calculating the volume of a sphere.
