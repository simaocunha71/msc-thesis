# It's important to note that the math.isclose() function is used in Python 3.5 and later to compare two floating point numbers for equality. It returns True if the absolute difference between the two numbers is less than the relative tolerance. Otherwise, it returns False.

# Here, the function volume_sphere() takes a radius as an argument and returns the volume of the sphere. The formula for the volume of a sphere is (4/3) * Ï€ * r ** 3. The math.pi is a constant that represents pi (approximately 3.14159265359). The function math.pow() is used to calculate the cube of the radius. The function math.isclose() is used to check if the calculated volume is approximately equal to 4188.790204786391.

# The assert statement is used to check if the calculated volume is approximately equal to 4188.790204786391. If the assert statement is True, the program will continue to execute. If the assert statement is False, the program will raise an AssertionError and stop executing.

# The rel_tol parameter in the math.isclose() function is the relative tolerance for the comparison. It is used to compare two floating point numbers that are close to each other. In this case, the relative tolerance is set to 0.001, which means that the absolute difference between the calculated volume and the expected volume should be less than 0.001 times the value of the calculated volume.
