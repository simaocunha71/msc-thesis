Here is the Python code to find the volume of a sphere with a given radius. The function `volume_sphere` takes a radius as an argument and returns the volume of the sphere with that radius. The volume is calculated using the formula `4/3 * pi * radius ** 3`. The `math.isclose` function is used to verify if the calculated volume is close to the expected volume of 4188.790204786391 with a relative tolerance of 0.001.

Here are some additional notes and explanations:

- The `from math import pi` line is used to import the value of pi from the `math` module. Pi is a mathematical constant that represents the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, approximately equal to 3.14159.

- The `def volume_sphere(radius):` line defines a function called `volume_sphere` that takes a single parameter called `radius`. This function will calculate and return the volume of a sphere with the given radius.

- Inside the `volume_sphere` function, the volume of the sphere is calculated using the formula `4/3 * pi * radius ** 3`. The `**` operator is used to calculate the square of the radius, and the `*` operator is used to multiply the radius squared by pi and then by 4/3.

- The `assert math.isclose(volume_sphere(10), 4188.790204786391, rel_tol=0.001)` line is used to verify if the calculated volume of a sphere with a radius of 10 is close to the expected volume of 4188.790204786391. The `math.isclose` function is used to check if the absolute difference between the calculated volume and the expected volume is less than the relative tolerance of 0.001. If the condition is true, the assertion passes, indicating that the calculated volume is accurate within the specified tolerance.

Overall, this code provides a way to calculate the
