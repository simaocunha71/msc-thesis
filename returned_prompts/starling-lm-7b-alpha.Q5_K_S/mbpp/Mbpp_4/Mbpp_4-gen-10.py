To solve this problem, you can use the heap queue data structure. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:

1. Initialize a min heap (which is a max heap) and add the numbers from the input list one by one. Since the heap is a max heap, the largest element is at the root of the heap.
2. To get the n largest numbers, you need to remove the largest element from the heap n times.
3. When you remove an element from the heap, it returns the root of the heap (i.e., the maximum element), and then it shifts all the elements down to maintain the heap property. Since the heap is a max heap, the maximum element is at the root of the heap, and the largest elements are always at the top of the heap.
4. After removing the elements, return the remaining elements in the heap, which are the n largest elements from the input list.
5. Implement the heap_queue_largest function as shown in the code below:
"""

def heap_queue_largest(numbers, n):
    # Initialize a max heap (heapify the list of numbers)
    import heapq
    heap = [-num for num in numbers]
    heapq.heapify(heap)
    # Get the n largest elements from the heap
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        result.append(-heapq.heappop(heap))
    # Reverse the result to get the elements in descending order
    result.reverse()
    return result

# Test the function
print(heap_queue_largest([25, 35, 22, 85, 14, 65, 75, 22, 58], 3))  # [85, 75, 65]
```
    
```
"""
This function works by first converting the list of numbers into a min heap using the `heapify` function from the `heapq` module. Then, it iterates `n` times, using `heappop` to remove the smallest element (which is the largest element in a max heap) from the heap and appending it to the `result` list. Finally, it reverses the `result` list to get the
