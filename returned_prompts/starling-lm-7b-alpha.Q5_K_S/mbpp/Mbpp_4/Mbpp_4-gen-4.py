Here's how I would approach this problem:

1. First, I would import the heapq module which provides an implementation of the heap queue algorithm, which is exactly what we need for this problem. The heap queue algorithm allows us to keep track of the n largest elements in a list, and is especially useful for this problem since it allows us to efficiently find the largest elements.

2. Next, I would define a function called heap_queue_largest which takes in two parameters: a list of numbers, and the number of largest elements we want to find (n).

3. Inside the function, I would convert the input list of numbers into a heap queue using the heapq.nlargest function. The heapq.nlargest function takes in two parameters: the list of numbers, and the number of largest elements we want to find (n). This function returns a list containing the n largest elements from the input list.

4. Finally, I would return the list of the n largest elements from the input list.

Here's the code for the function:

```python
import heapq

def heap_queue_largest(nums, n):
    return heapq.nlargest(n, nums)
```

And here's an example of how to use the function:

```python
print(heap_queue_largest([25, 35, 22, 85, 14, 65, 75, 22, 58], 3))  # Output: [85, 75, 65]
```
"""

# Python program to find the n
# largest elements in a given
# list of numbers

import heapq

def heap_queue_largest(nums, n):
    return heapq.nlargest(n, nums)

# Driver Code
nums = [25, 35, 22, 85, 14, 65, 75, 22, 58]
n = 3
print(heap_queue_largest(nums, n))
```

This program uses the `heapq` module in Python to find the `n` largest elements in a list of numbers
