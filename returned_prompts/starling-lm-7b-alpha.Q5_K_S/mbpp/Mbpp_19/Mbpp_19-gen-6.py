"""
The time complexity of this function is O(n) because we are using a counter which requires a single pass over the input.
"""




"""
The space complexity of this function is O(n) as we are storing each element of the array in a counter.
"""

"""
This function works by creating a counter, which is a dictionary subclass for counting hashable objects. It iterates over the input array and counts the number of occurrences of each element. Then, it checks if there is any count greater than one. If there is, the function returns True, indicating that a duplicate element exists. Otherwise, it returns False.
"""



"""
To test the function, you can use the provided assert statement, which checks if the function correctly detects the absence of duplicate elements in a given array. You can replace the array with any other array of integers to test the function.
"""

"""
The function can be used to determine if an array contains any duplicate elements. It is particularly useful in situations where you need to ensure the uniqueness of elements in an array, such as in data structures, algorithms, or database queries.
"""

"""
In the context of data structures and algorithms, this function can be used as a building block for more complex tasks, such as finding the union or intersection of arrays, or implementing set operations like union, intersection, and difference.
"""

"""
This function can also be used in the context of database queries, where it can help identify duplicate records or values in a dataset, which can be useful for data cleansing, deduplication, or data validation tasks.
"""


"""
In the context of programming languages and frameworks, this function can be implemented using various programming constructs, such as loops, conditional statements, and collections. The specific implementation may vary depending on the language or framework being used.
"""

"""
In the context of software development best practices, it is important to write clear and concise code that is easy to understand and maintain. The provided implementation of the function is relatively straightforward, using a single loop and a counter from the collections module. This makes it easy to read and understand
