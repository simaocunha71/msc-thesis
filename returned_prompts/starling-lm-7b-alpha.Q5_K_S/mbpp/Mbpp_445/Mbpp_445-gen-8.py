This function takes in two tuples and performs index wise multiplication of tuple elements. The function first creates an empty list called `res` to store the result of multiplication. The function then uses a for loop to iterate through the indices of the tuples. At each index, the function multiplies the corresponding elements of the tuples and appends the result to the `res` list. Finally, the function returns the `res` list as a tuple.

# Example usage:
t1 = (1, 3, 4, 5, 2, 9, 1, 10)
t2 = (6, 7, 3, 9, 1, 1, 7, 3)
print(index_multiplication(t1, t2))  # Output: (6, 21, 12, 45, 2, 9, 7, 30)

"""
The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the tuples, as it iterates through the tuples once. The space complexity is also O(n) as it stores the result of multiplication in a list.

In this Python program, the function `index_multiplication` is defined to perform index wise multiplication of tuple elements in two given tuples. The function takes in two tuples, `t1` and `t2`, as parameters. It creates an empty list `res` to store the result of multiplication. Then, it uses a for loop to iterate through the indices of the tuples. At each index, it multiplies the
