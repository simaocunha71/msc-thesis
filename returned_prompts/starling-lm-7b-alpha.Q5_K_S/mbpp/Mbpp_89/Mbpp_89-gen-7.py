Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:
1. Check if the number is even or odd. If it's even, we can simply subtract the remainder of the number divided by 2 to get the closest smaller number. If it's odd, we can subtract the remainder of the number divided by 2 and add 1 to get the closest smaller number.
2. If the number is 2, we can return 0 as the closest smaller number.
3. If the number is 1, we can return 0 as the closest smaller number.
4. In the provided solution, the function `closest_num` takes a number `n` as input and follows the steps mentioned above to find the closest smaller number.
5. The function `closest_num` returns the closest smaller number.

In the given code, the function `closest_num` is defined with the correct logic to find the closest smaller number. The function checks if the number is even or odd using the modulo
