While this solution passes the provided test, it will not pass all tests due to a potential infinite loop.

A better solution is as follows:

def closest_num(n):
    # get the nearest number
    nearest_num = n
    while True:
        if nearest_num > 0 and nearest_num % 2 == 0:
            break
        nearest_num -= 1
    return nearest_num

# tests
assert closest_num(11) == 10
print("All tests passed")
"""














"""
To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. Initialize the variable nearest_num with the value of n.
2. While the nearest_num is greater than 0 and the nearest_num is not divisible by 2, decrement the nearest_num by 1 and repeat the step 2.
3. Return the value of nearest_num.

The above steps will ensure that we find the closest smaller number than n that is divisible by 2.

For example, if n = 11, the nearest_num will be 10, which is the closest smaller number that is divisible by 2.

The provided test assertion tests the function with the input 11 and verifies if the function returns the correct result, which is 10.
