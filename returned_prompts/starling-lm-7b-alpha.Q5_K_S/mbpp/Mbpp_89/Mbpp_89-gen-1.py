This is a Python program that defines a function `closest_num` to find the closest smaller number than `n`. The function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the closest smaller number.

The function first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 0, in which case it returns `None` as there are no smaller numbers.

Then, it uses a `for` loop to iterate from `n` down to 1 (inclusive), with a step size of -1. Inside the loop, it checks if the current number `i` is smaller than `n`, and if so, it returns `i`.

Finally, the function is tested with the example `closest_num(11)` and the expected result of 10 is printed.

Note that this implementation assumes that `n` is a positive integer. If `n` can be negative or non-integer, additional checks and adjustments may be needed.

Overall, this program provides a simple and efficient solution to find the closest smaller number than a given number in Python.
