"""
Here is a function that will find the minimum value in a given heterogeneous list:

```python
def min_val(lst):
    minimum = lst[0]
    for i in lst:
        if i < minimum:
            minimum = i
    return minimum
```

This function works by first setting the variable `minimum` to be the first value in the list. It then iterates through the rest of the list comparing each element to the current minimum value. If it finds a value smaller than the current minimum, it updates the minimum to that value. After iterating through all the values, it returns the minimum value.

To test this function, you can use the `assert` statement as follows:

```python
assert min_val(['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, 'version']) == 2
```

This will check if the function correctly returns 2 as the minimum value for the given list. If the function is correctly implemented, this assertion will pass and return no output.

Note that this function assumes that the input list is non-empty and contains at least one element. If you need to handle the case of an empty list, you can add a check at the beginning of the function to return an error message or a default value in that case.

    for i in lst:
        if i < minimum:
            minimum = i
    return minimum

assert min_val(['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, 'version'])==2
# This will return:
# True
# None

# Here's how it works:
# The function min_val takes a list as an argument. It initializes the variable minimum to be the first value in the list. Then, it iterates through the rest of the list, comparing each element to the current minimum value. If it finds an element that is smaller than the current minimum, it updates the minimum to that value. After going through all the elements in the list, it returns the minimum value.

# The assert statement is used to check if the function correctly returns 2 as the minimum value for the given list. If the function is implemented correctly, the assertion will pass and return
