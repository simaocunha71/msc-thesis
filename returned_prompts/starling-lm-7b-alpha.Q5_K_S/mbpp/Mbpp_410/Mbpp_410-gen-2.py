"""
def min_val(lst):

"""

Here are some other ways to solve the problem:

```python
def min_val(lst):
    return min(lst)
```

The `min()` function can find the minimum value in a list, tuple, string, and other types of collections.

Here are some additional tests:

```python
def min_val(lst):
    return min(lst)

print(min_val([2, 3, 5, 6, 9]))  # prints: 2
print(min_val([3, 5, 6, 9, 12]))  # prints: 3
print(min_val([12, 3, 5, 6, 9]))  # prints: 3
print(min_val([-1, 3, 5, 6, 9]))  # prints: -1
print(min_val(['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, 'version']))  # prints: 2
```

In addition, the `min()` function can also find the minimum value in a tuple:

```python
def min_val(tup):
    return min(tup)

print(min_val((2, 3, 5, 6, 9)))  # prints: 2
```

Furthermore, the `min()` function can find the minimum value in a string:

```python
def min_val(str):
    return min(str)

print(min_val('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'))  # prints: 'a'
```

Here are some additional tests:

```python
def min_val(str):
    return min(str)

print(min_val('987654321'))  # prints: 1
print(min_val('0987654321'))  # prints: 0
```
