Here's a possible solution:
```
def min_val(lst):
    # Initialize min_val to the first element in the list
    min_val = lst[0]
    # Iterate through the list
    for i in range(1, len(lst)):
        # If the current element is smaller than min_val, update min_val
        if lst[i] < min_val:
            min_val = lst[i]
    # Return min_val
    return min_val

# Test the function
assert min_val(['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, 'version'])==2
```

This solution initializes the `min_val` variable to the first element in the list. It then iterates through the remaining elements of the list, comparing each element to the current `min_val`. If a smaller element is found, `min_val` is updated. Finally, the function returns the minimum value found.

To test the function, the `assert` statement is used to verify that the function correctly identifies the minimum value in the given list `['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, 'version']`. The expected output is `2`.

By running the test, we can ensure that the `min_val` function correctly identifies the minimum value in a heterogeneous list.

```python
def min_val(lst):
    # Initialize min_val to the first element in the list
    min_val = lst[0]
    # Iterate through the list
