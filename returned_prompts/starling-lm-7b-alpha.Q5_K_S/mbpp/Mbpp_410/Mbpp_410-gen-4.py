Here is the function to find the minimum value in a given heterogeneous list:

def min_val(lst):
    min_val = lst[0]

Here is the function to find the minimum value in a given heterogeneous list:

def min_val(lst):
    min_val = lst[0]
    for i in range(1, len(lst)):
        if min_val > lst[i]:
            min_val = lst[i]
    return min_val

In the function above, we first initialize the minimum value to the first element in the given list. Then, we iterate through the rest of the list starting from the second element. If the current element is smaller than the current minimum value, we update the minimum value to be that element. Finally, we return the minimum value after iterating through all the elements.

To test the function, you can use the following code:

assert min_val(['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, 'version'])==2

This will assert that the minimum value of the given list ['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, 'version'] is 2, which should be true according to the function implementation.
