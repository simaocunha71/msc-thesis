# This code defines a function called `volume_cube` that takes a single argument, `side_length`. The function calculates and returns the volume of a cube with the given side length by cubing the side length. The assertion at the end of the code checks if the function works correctly by comparing the result of `volume_cube(3)` to the expected result of 27.

To use the `volume_cube` function, you can call it with a specific side length as an argument. For example, `volume_cube(4)` would return 64, as the volume of a cube with a side length of 4 is 64.

Here's an example of how you can use the `volume_cube` function:

```python
volume = volume_cube(3)
print(volume)  # Output: 27
```

In this example, the `volume_cube` function is called with a side length of 3, and the returned volume is assigned to the variable `volume`. Finally, the volume is printed, resulting in the output of 27, which is the correct volume of a cube with a side length of 3.

You can replace the side length argument with any positive integer to calculate the volume of a cube with that side length.

Overall, the `volume_cube` function provides an efficient and accurate way to calculate the volume of a cube given its side length in Python.

# Here are some additional notes and tips for using the `volume_cube` function:

# 1. The `volume_cube` function is a pure function, meaning it does not have any side effects and always produces the same output for the same input. This makes it suitable for use in various contexts where a reliable and consistent calculation of the volume of a cube is needed.

# 2. The function is implemented using the mathematical formula for the volume of a cube, which is the cube of the side length. This ensures that the result is always accurate and does not require any additional calculations or approximations.

# 3. The `volume_cube` function is written in a way
