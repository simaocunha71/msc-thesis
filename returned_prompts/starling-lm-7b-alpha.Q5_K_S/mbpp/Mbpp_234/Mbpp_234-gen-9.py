In the provided code, a function named `volume_cube` is defined that calculates and returns the volume of a cube given its side length as an argument. The function uses the formula for the volume of a cube, which is the side length raised to the power of 3. 

To test the function, the code includes a print statement that calls `volume_cube` with the side length of 3. The result, 27, is displayed in the console. 

The assert statement at the beginning of the code is a way to validate the correctness of the function. It checks if the result of `volume_cube(3)` is equal to 27, and if not, an error is raised. 

Overall, this code defines a function that calculates the volume of a cube and provides a test case to ensure its correctness.
