def volume_cube(s):
    '''
    Find the volume of a cube given its side length.

    Parameters
    ----------
    s : float
        The side length of the cube.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        The volume of the cube.

    return s**3

Here's a function that calculates the volume of a cube given its side length. It works by cubing the side length. The function is decorated with a docstring, which provides information about the function's purpose, parameters, and return type.

To use this function, you can call it with the side length of the cube as an argument. For example, to find the volume of a cube with side length 3, you would call `volume_cube(3)`. The function would then return the volume of the cube, which in this case would be 27. 

The docstring also includes an assertion to verify the correctness of the function. The assertion checks that the function returns the expected result for the given example (side length 3 and volume 27). 

Overall, this function provides a straightforward way to calculate the volume of a cube given its side length.

```python
print(volume_cube(3))  # prints: 27
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to use the `volume_cube` function to calculate the volume of a cube with side length 3. The result, 27, is printed to the console.

```python
assert volume_cube(3)==27
```

This line of code asserts that the `volume_cube` function, when called with the argument 3, returns the expected result of 27. If the assertion fails (i.e., if the function does not return 27), an AssertionError will be raised.

By including this assertion, we can ensure that the `volume_cube` function is working correctly and producing the expected results.

```python
volume_cube(4)  # prints: 64
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to use the `volume_cube` function to calculate the volume of a
