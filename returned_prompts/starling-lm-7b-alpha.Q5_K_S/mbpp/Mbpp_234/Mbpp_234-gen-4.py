    Find the volume of a cube given its side length.

    Parameters:
    side (int): the side length of the cube

```
"""
In the above code, the function `volume_cube(side)` takes the side length of the cube as a parameter and returns the volume of the cube. The volume of a cube is calculated by raising the side length to the power of 3. The function is then tested by passing the side length of 3 to the function and checking if the returned value is equal to 27.
