"""
The lateral surface area of a cube can be found by squaring the length of one of its sides and then multiplying by 4.

Here's a function that does this:

def lateralsurface_cube(side_length):
    return 4 * (side_length ** 2)

To check if the function is correct, you can use the `assert` keyword to compare the result of the function with a known result. Here's an example:

assert lateralsurface_cube(5) == 100

If the function is correct, the `assert` statement will not raise an error. If the function is incorrect, the `assert` statement will raise an `AssertionError` with a helpful error message.
