To calculate the lateral surface area of a cube, we need to know the length of its side. Here's a step-by-step guide to create a function that does just that:

1. Define a function called lateralsurface_cube that takes in one parameter, the side length of the cube.
2. Since a cube has 6 equal sides, we can calculate the lateral surface area by multiplying the side length by 4 and then multiplying the result by the length of one side. This is because each side of the cube has an area of side_length * side_length, and there are 4 sides.
3. Return the calculated lateral surface area as the result of the function.

Here's the Python code that implements the above steps:
"""

def lateralsurface_cube(side_length):
    return 4 * side_length ** 2

# Test the function with a known value
print(lateralsurface_cube(5) == 100)  # This should return True

```
```python

```
```

```

```

```

```

```

```
```

To test the function with a known value, you can use the following code:

```python
print(lateralsurface_cube(5)
