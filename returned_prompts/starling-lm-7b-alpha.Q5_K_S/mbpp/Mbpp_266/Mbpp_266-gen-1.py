```
def lateralsurface_cube(x):
    return 6*x**2
```

In this function, we simply multiply the side length of the cube by 6 and square it to find the lateral surface area of the cube.

Here's a quick breakdown of the function:

- `x` is the side length of the cube.
- `6*x**2` calculates the lateral surface area of the cube. Since a cube has 6 faces and the length of each face is the side length squared, we multiply the side length by 6 and square it.
- The function returns the lateral surface area of the cube.

We test the function with `lateralsurface_cube(5)` to ensure it correctly calculates the lateral surface area of a cube with a side length of 5. The expected result is 100, and the function should return this value.

This function can be used to find the lateral surface area of any cube, regardless of its side length.

As an additional note, the lateral surface area of a cube is always equal to the perimeter of one of its faces multiplied by 4. This is because a cube has 4 identical faces, and the perimeter of one face is equal to the side length times 4. For example, if the side length of a cube is 5, the perimeter of one face is 5*4=20, and the lateral surface area of the cube is 4 times the perimeter of one face, which is 4*20=80. This relationship holds true for cubes of any side length.

To summarize, the lateral surface area of a cube is equal to the side length squared multiplied by 6 or the perimeter of one of its faces multiplied by 4.

In Python, the function `lateralsurface_cube(x)` calculates the lateral surface area of a cube with a side length of `x`. The function `assert lateralsurface_cube(5)==100` checks if the function returns the correct result for a cube with a side length of 5, which it should.
