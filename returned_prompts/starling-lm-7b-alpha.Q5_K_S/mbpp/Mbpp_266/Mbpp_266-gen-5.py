The above Python code defines a function called `lateralsurface_cube` that takes a single argument, `side_length`, and returns the lateral surface area of a cube given its side length using the formula `4 * side_length * side_length`. The function is then tested by calling it with the argument `5` and checking if the result is equal to `100`. The expected output is `True`, indicating that the function correctly calculates the lateral surface area of a cube.

# Lateral Surface Area of a Cube

To calculate the lateral surface area of a cube, we need to know the length of one side of the cube. The lateral surface area of a cube is four times the square of the side length (4s^2).

For example, if the side length of the cube is 5 units, the lateral surface area would be 4 * 5^2 = 100 square units.

Here's a Python function that calculates the lateral surface area of a cube:

```python
def lateralsurface_cube(side_length):
    return 4 * side_length ** 2
```

To use the function, you can call it with the side length of the cube as an argument. For example, to calculate the lateral surface area of a cube with a side length of 5 units, you would
