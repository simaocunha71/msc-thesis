In this problem, we need to check if all the elements of a given list are equal to a given element. We can use the set data structure in Python to solve this problem.

Here's how it works:

1. Create a function called `check_element` that takes in two parameters: `my_list` (the input list) and `ele` (the element to compare against).
2. Inside the function, use the `set` function to convert the `my_list` to a set. A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements. Since a set only contains unique elements, if all the elements in the list are the same, the length of the set will be 1. If the length is not 1, it means there are duplicate elements in the list.
3. Check if the length of the set is equal to 1. If it is, return True, indicating that all the elements in the list are equal to the given element. Otherwise, return False.
4. Finally, use the `print` function to print the result of calling the `check_element` function with the given list and element.

The provided code should give the expected output of False, as not all elements in the list are equal to the given element 'blue'.

This solution is efficient as it only requires a single pass through the list to create the set and determine the length. The use of the set data structure ensures that duplicate elements are automatically removed, simplifying the logic of the function.

Overall, this solution provides a clear and concise way to check if all the elements in a list are equal to a given element using Python.
