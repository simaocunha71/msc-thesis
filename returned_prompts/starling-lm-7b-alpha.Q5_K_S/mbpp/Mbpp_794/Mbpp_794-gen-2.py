```python
import re

def text_starta_endb(text):
    pattern = r"a.*b$"
    return re.fullmatch(pattern, text)
```

Explanation:

The regular expression `r"a.*b$"` matches a string that starts with 'a', followed by any characters (`.*`), and ends with 'b'. The `.*` part of the expression is a shorthand for `[^\\n]*(?:\\r?\\n|$)`, which means it matches zero or more of any character except newline, followed by a newline or the end of the string.

The `re.fullmatch` function checks if the entire string matches the pattern from start to end, and returns `True` if it does, and `False` otherwise.

The `assert text_starta_endb("aabbbb")` statement checks if the function `text_starta_endb` correctly matches the string "aabbbb". Since the string starts with 'a', followed by any characters, and ends with 'b', the function should return `True` and the assertion will pass.

Overall, the function `text_starta_endb` uses regular expressions to match strings that start with 'a', followed by any characters, and end with 'b'.

Here's a breakdown of the regular expression pattern:

- `r`: The `r` prefix indicates that the pattern is a raw string, which treats backslashes as literal characters.
- `"a"`: Matches the character 'a' literally.
- `".*"`: Matches any character (`.*`) zero or more times (`*`).
- `"b$"`: Matches the character 'b' at the end of the string (`$`).

The `re.fullmatch` function ensures that the entire string matches the pattern from start to end, returning `True` if it does, and `False` otherwise.

By using this regular expression pattern and the `re.fullmatch` function, you can determine if a string starts with 'a', followed by any characters, and ends with 'b'.

In the provided code, the `assert` statement is used to test the `text_starta_endb` function with the
