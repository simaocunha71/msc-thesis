```python
import re
def text_starta_endb(s):
    return bool(re.match(r"a.*b$", s))
```

Explanation:
The regular expression r"a.*b$" is used to match strings that start with an 'a', followed by any character (.* means any character zero or more times), and ending with a 'b'. The re.match function is then used to check if the input string matches this pattern. The function returns True if it does, and False otherwise.

In the given code, the function text_starta_endb is defined to take a string s as an argument. Inside the function, the re.match function is used to check if the string s matches the regular expression r"a.*b$". The result of this match is stored in the variable m. If the match is successful (i.e., m is not None), the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

To test the function, the assert statement is used to check if the function returns True for the input string "aabbbb". If the function does not return True for this input, the assert statement will raise an AssertionError, indicating that the function is not working correctly.

Overall, this code defines and tests a function that matches strings starting with an 'a' and ending with a 'b', using regular expressions and the re.match function from the re module.
