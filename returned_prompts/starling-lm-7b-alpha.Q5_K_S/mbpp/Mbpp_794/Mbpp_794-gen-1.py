# Explanation:
"""
The function checks if the input string starts with 'a' and ends with 'b'. If both conditions are true, the function returns True, otherwise False.
"""

"""
The function starts by using the startswith() function to check if the string starts with 'a'. If it does, the function continues to the next step. If it doesn't, the function immediately returns False, as the condition of the string starting with 'a' is not met.

Next, the function uses the endswith() function to check if the string ends with 'b'. If it does, the function returns True, as both conditions (starting with 'a' and ending with 'b') are met. If it doesn't, the function immediately returns False, as the condition of the string ending with 'b' is not met.

Finally, if both conditions are met, the function returns True. If either condition is not met, the function returns False.

"""
Overall, the function is a simple implementation of the given requirements, and it correctly matches a string that starts with 'a' and ends with 'b'.

```python
def text_starta_endb(s):
    return s.startswith('a') and s.endswith('b')
```

This function will return True if the string starts with 'a' and ends with 'b', and False otherwise. Here are a few examples to illustrate its usage:

```python
print(text_starta_endb("aabbbb"))  # True
print(text_starta_endb("aaac"))    # False
print(text_starta_endb("axay"))    # False
```

In the first example, the string "aabbbb" starts with 'a' and ends with 'b', so the function returns True. In the second and
