This is a dynamic programming problem. The idea is to use memoization to cache the results of subproblems. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm:

1. Define a function `get_max_sum` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the maximum sum of the given equation.
2. Check if `n` is less than 1. If so, return 0 since the maximum sum is 0.
3. Check if `n` is less than or equal to 60. If so, return the maximum sum for that value from a precomputed table of values. This is done to avoid redundant calculations for small values of `n`.
4. If `n` is greater than 60, compute all the divisors of `n` using the `get_divisors` function. This function generates all the divisors of a number in increasing order.
5. For each divisor `d`, recursively call the `get_max_sum` function with the argument `d` to get the maximum sum for that divisor. Store the results in a list called `max_sums`.
6. Sort the `max_sums` list in descending order. This is done to select the maximum sum from the available options.
7. Return the maximum sum from the `max_sums` list, adding `n` to it. This is the maximum sum possible using
