This function calculates the maximum sum by recursively using the given equation. It checks the remainder of the number after dividing it by 5, 4, 3, and 2. If the remainder is 0, it recursively calls the function with the number divided by the corresponding divisor, and adds the number to the result. The function continues this process until it reaches the base case, where the number is not divisible by 5, 4, 3, or 2. At this point, it returns the number itself as the maximum sum.

To test the function, you can use the `assert` statement to check if the function correctly calculates the maximum sum for a given input. In this case, `get_max_sum(60)` should return 106, so the `assert` statement will pass and no error will be raised.

You can replace `get_max_sum(60)` with any other number to test the function for different inputs.

Note: The function assumes that the input `n` is a positive integer. It does not handle negative numbers or non-integer inputs, so make sure to provide valid input when using the function.

Overall, this function provides a straightforward implementation of the equation to find the maximum sum possible using the given equation.

This solution has a time complexity of O(log(n)), as it recursively divides the input number by the closest divisor in each recursion step. The function stops when it reaches the base case, where the number is not divisible by 5, 4, 3, or 2.

The space complexity of this solution is O(log(n)) as well, as the maximum depth of the recursion tree is logarithmic in the size of the
