# To solve the problem of heterogeneous lists, we can use Counter from collections. The counter returns a dictionary
# where the keys are the elements from the list and the values are the count of each element.
# If all elements are different, this would return the maximum value. However, if there are duplicate values,
# it would return the maximum count. Therefore, to ensure we find the maximum value, we find the maximum of the values
# of the Counter dictionary.

This is a good example of how Python's built-in libraries can be leveraged to solve a problem with simple functions.
