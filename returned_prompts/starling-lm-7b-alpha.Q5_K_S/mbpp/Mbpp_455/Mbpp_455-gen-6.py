def check_monthnumb_number(monthnum):
    months = [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]
    if monthnum in months:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

In this code, we define a function called `check_monthnumb_number` that takes a parameter `monthnum` which represents the month number. Inside the function, we have a list called `months` which contains the month numbers that have 31 days. We then check if the `monthnum` is in the `months` list. If it is, we return `True` to indicate that the month has 31 days. Otherwise, we return `False`.

To test this function, you can use the `assert` statement as shown in the comment. The `assert` statement is a way to check if a condition is true, and if it is not true, an error will be raised. In this case, we are asserting that when we pass the month number 5 to the `check_monthnumb_number` function, it should return `True`. If this condition is true, the `assert` statement will not raise an error, and the program will continue to execute.

This code can be used to check if a given month number contains 31 days or not.

```python
def check_monthnumb_number(monthnum):
    months = [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]
    if monthnum in months:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

To use this function, you can simply call it with a month number as the argument. For example, if you want to check if the month number 5 has 31 days, you can do:

```python
print(check_monthnumb_number(5))  # This will print True
```

The function will return `True` if the month number is in the `months` list, and `False` otherwise.

```python
print(check_monthnumb_number(2))  # This will print False
```

In this case, the function will return `False` because the month
