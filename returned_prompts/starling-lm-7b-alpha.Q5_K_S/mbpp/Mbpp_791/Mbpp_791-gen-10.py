To solve this problem, we can define a function called remove_nested that takes a tuple as an argument. Inside the function, we can use a for loop to iterate through each element of the tuple. If an element is a tuple itself, we can recursively call the remove_nested function to remove nested tuples until we only have a single number left. Finally, we can return the modified tuple without the nested tuples.

Here's the code:
"""

def remove_nested(t):
    result = []
    for elem in t:
        if type(elem) == tuple:
            result.append(remove_nested(elem))
        else:
            result.append(elem)
    return tuple(result)

# Testing the function
assert remove_nested((1, 5, 7, (4, 6), 10)) == (1, 5, 7, 10)

"""
The assert statement is used to check if the function remove_nested returns the expected result. In this case, we are checking if removing the nested tuple (4, 6) from the original tuple (1, 5, 7, (4, 6), 10) results in the modified tuple (1, 5, 7, 10). The assert statement will raise an error if the condition is not met, helping us verify if our function is working correctly.
"""

"""
In this solution, we use the tuple data structure in Python to store the modified elements of the original tuple. We initialize an empty list called result to store the elements that are not nested tuples. Then, we use a for loop to iterate through each element of the original tuple. If an element is a tuple itself, we recursively call the remove_nested function to remove nested tuples until we only have a single number left. We then append the non-tuple elements to the result list. Finally, we convert the result list back to a tuple using the tuple() function and return it as the modified tuple without the nested tuples.

The assert statement is used to verify if the function remove_nested is working correctly. It checks if the function returns the expected result when given a specific tuple as an argument. If the condition is not met, it raises an error, helping us identify and fix any issues with the function's implementation.
