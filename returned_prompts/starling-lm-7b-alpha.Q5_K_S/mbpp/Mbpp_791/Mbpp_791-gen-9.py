# This code is incorrect because it will raise a TypeError.
# The error is that we cannot directly use append() to add an element to a tuple.
# Because tuple is an immutable sequence type in Python, it cannot be changed after it is created.

# To solve this problem, we can create a new tuple and add the elements we want to keep to this new tuple.
# Here is the correct code:

# The output of this code will be: (1, 5, 7, 10)
# The function remove_nested() has successfully removed the tuples from the given tuple.

# However, it's important to note that this method may not be efficient if the given tuple contains many nested tuples.
# This is because Python has to create a new tuple for each element in the given tuple, which can be inefficient.
# Therefore, when dealing with large amounts of data, we may need to consider using other methods to solve this problem.

# Here are some alternative methods:
