Here are two ways to convert a string to a tuple of characters:

1. `def string_to_tuple(s): return tuple(s)`: This function takes a string `s` as input and returns a tuple of characters. It does so by converting the string `s` to a tuple using the built-in `tuple()` function.

2. `def string_to_tuple_v2(s): return tuple(i for i in s)`: This function also takes a string `s` as input and returns a tuple of characters. It uses a generator expression `(i for i in s)` to iterate over each character in the string `s` and convert it to a tuple.

Both functions will produce the same result when given the string "python 3.0". The choice between the two approaches depends on personal preference and the specific requirements of your program.

To test the functions, the code includes two print statements that call `string_to_tuple("
