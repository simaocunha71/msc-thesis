Here's one way you could write the function:

```python
def sum_in_range(l, r):
    total = 0
    for i in range(l, r+1):
        if i % 2 != 0:
            total += i
    return total
```

To test the function, you can call it with the arguments 2 and 5:

```python
assert sum_in_range(2,5) == 8
```

Explanation:
The function `sum_in_range` takes two arguments, `l` and `r`, which represent the range of natural numbers to consider. It initializes a variable `total` to 0 to store the sum of odd numbers. Then, it uses a `for` loop to iterate through all the numbers in the range from `l` to `r+1`. For each number `i`, it checks if `i` is odd by using the modulo operator `%` to check if the remainder of `i` divided by 2 is not equal to 0. If `i` is odd, it adds `i` to the `total`. Finally, it returns the `total` sum of odd numbers within the range `l` and `r`.

The assert statement `assert sum_in_range(2,5) == 8` is used to check if the function correctly calculates the sum of odd natural numbers within the range 2 to 5. If the function returns 8, the assertion passes and the program continues running. Otherwise, an error message is raised.

This function can be used to find the sum of all odd natural numbers within any given range by calling it with the appropriate arguments.

```python
sum_in_range(2, 5)  # Returns 8
```

You can test the function with different ranges to ensure it works correctly. For example, you can test it with `sum_in_range(1, 10)` to find the sum of odd natural numbers from 1 to 10, which should be 25.

```python
sum_in_range(1, 10)  # Returns 25
```

Additionally, you can test edge cases, such as `sum_in_range(
