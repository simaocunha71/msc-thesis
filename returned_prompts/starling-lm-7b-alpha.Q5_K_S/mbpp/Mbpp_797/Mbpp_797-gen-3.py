Here's a Python function that calculates the sum of all odd natural numbers in the range [l, r]:

```python
def sum_in_range(l, r):
    total = 0
    for i in range(l, r+1):
        if i % 2 != 0:
            total += i
    return total
```

To test this function, you can use the `assert` keyword to verify if the function gives the correct result for a specific range of numbers:

```python
assert sum_in_range(2, 5) == 8
```

In this example, `sum_in_range(2, 5)` should return the sum of odd natural numbers within the range [2, 5], which are 2, 3, 5. The sum of these numbers is indeed 8, so the assertion passes and the function is correct.

It's important to note that the function uses a `for` loop to iterate through all the numbers in the range [l, r]. For each number, it checks if it's odd by using the modulo operator (`%`). If the number is odd (i.e., its remainder when divided by 2 is not zero), it adds the number to the `total` variable. Finally, it returns the `total` sum.

Feel free to use this function in your code to find the sum of odd natural numbers within a specific range.

```python
def sum_in_range(l, r):
    total = 0
    for i in range(l, r+1):
        if i % 2 != 0:
            total += i
    return total
```

To test the function, you can use the `assert` keyword to verify if the function gives the correct result for a specific range of numbers:

```python
assert sum_in_range(2, 5) == 8
```
