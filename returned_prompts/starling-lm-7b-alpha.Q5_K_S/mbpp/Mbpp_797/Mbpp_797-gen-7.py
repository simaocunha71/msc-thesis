Here's a Python function to find the sum of all odd natural numbers within the range l and r:

```python
def sum_in_range(l, r):
    total = 0
    for i in range(l, r + 1):
        if i % 2 != 0:
            total += i
    return total
```

To test the function, you can use the `assert` keyword to check if the function returns the expected result for the given range (in this case, 2 and 5). Here's an example:

```python
assert sum_in_range(2, 5) == 8
```

When you run this code, the `assert` statement will raise an `AssertionError` if the condition is not met (i.e., if the function does not return 8 for the given range). This helps ensure that the function is working correctly.

Additionally, you can print the result of the function to see the sum of all odd natural numbers within the range:

```python
print(sum_in_range(2, 5))  # Output: 8
```

This will display the sum of odd numbers from 2 to 5, which is 8.

```python
def sum_in_range(l, r):
    total = 0
    for i in range(l, r + 1):
        if i % 2 != 0:
            total += i
    return total
```

Here's an example of how you can use the `sum_in_range` function to find the sum of odd natural numbers within a range:

```python
result = sum_in_range(2, 5)
print(result)  # Output: 8
```

In this example, the `sum_in_range` function is called with the arguments `2` and `5`. The function then calculates the sum of all odd natural numbers from 2 to 5 (inclusive), which is 8. Finally, the result is printed to the console.

Note that the `sum_in_range` function uses a `for` loop to iterate over the range from `l` to `r + 1`. For each number in
