"""
This function works by iterating over the numbers from l to r using the range function in Python. The if statement checks if each number is odd by checking if the remainder of the number divided by 2 is not equal to 0. If the remainder is not 0, the number is odd and is added to the sum_odd variable. The function returns the sum_odd variable which contains the sum of all odd numbers within the range l and r.
"""


"""
In the assert statement, we are checking if the sum_in_range function correctly calculates the sum of all odd natural numbers within the range 2 and 5. We expect the function to return 8, which is the correct sum of the odd numbers 2, 3, 5.
"""


"""
To test the function, we can call it with the values 2 and 5 as arguments. This will calculate the sum of all odd natural numbers within the range 2 and 5, and return the result, which should be 8.
"""


"""
In the print statement, we are printing the result of the sum_in_range function, which should be 8. This verifies that the function is correctly calculating the sum of all odd natural numbers within the range 2 and 5.
"""


"""
By using the assert statement, we can verify that the sum_in_range function is correctly calculating the sum of all odd natural numbers within the range 2 and 5. This helps ensure that the function is working correctly and producing the expected results.
