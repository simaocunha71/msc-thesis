To check if the given array represents a min heap or not, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to define the properties of a min heap. A min heap is a complete binary tree where the value of each node is less than or equal to the values of its children.

2. Next, we can write a function called `check_min_heap` that takes an array as input and checks if it represents a min heap or not. The function can be implemented using a loop that iterates over the parent nodes of the array. For each parent node, we can compare its value with the maximum value among its children. If the parent value is not less than or equal to the maximum child value, the array does not represent a min heap, and we can return False. If all parent nodes satisfy the min heap property, the array represents a min heap, and we can return True.

Here's an example implementation of the `check_min_heap` function in Python:

```python
def check_min_heap(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n//2 - 1, -1, -1):
        left_child = 2 * i + 1
        right_child = 2 * i + 2
        max_child = max(arr[left_child], arr[right_child]) if left_child < n and right_child < n else float('inf')
        if arr[i] > max_child:
            return False
    return True
```

You can test the function with the given example `check_min_heap([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])` and it will return True, indicating that the array represents a min heap.

Note: The `n//2 - 1` in the loop condition is used to start the loop from the last parent node. The `//` operator performs integer division, which is necessary to ensure that the loop iterates over all parent nodes, including those at the top level of the array.
