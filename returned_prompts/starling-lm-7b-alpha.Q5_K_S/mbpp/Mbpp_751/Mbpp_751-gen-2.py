To check if the given array represents a min heap or not, you can follow these steps:

1. Check if the root of the heap (the element at index 0) is the smallest element in the heap. This is because in a min heap, the root is always the smallest element.
2. Recursively check the left and right subtrees of each node. For each node, check if the left child is smaller than or equal to the right child. This is because in a min heap, the left child should be smaller than or equal to the right child.
3. If any of these conditions are not met, return False, indicating that the array does not represent a min heap. Otherwise, if all conditions are met, return True, indicating that the array represents a min heap.

Here's a Python implementation of the `check_min_heap` function that follows these steps:

```python
def check_min_heap(heap):
    def _check(start, end):
        if start >= end:
            return True

        root = start
        left = 2 * root + 1
        right = 2 * root + 2

        if left < end and heap[left] < heap[root]:
            return False

        if right < end and heap[right] < heap[root]:
            return False

        return _check(left, end) and _check(right, end)

    return _check(0, len(heap))
```

You can use the `check_min_heap` function to check if a given array represents a min heap. For example, `check_min_heap([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])` will return `True` because the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] represents a min heap.

Note: The `check_min_heap` function assumes that the input array is a list of integers. It does not check if the input array is actually a heap (i.e., a complete binary tree) or if the heap property holds for all nodes in the array.
