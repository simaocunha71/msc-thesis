To check if an array represents a min heap or not, we can follow these steps:

1. Ensure that the array is not empty. If it is, then it is not a valid min heap.
2. Check that the parent nodes are smaller than or equal to their child nodes. This is the key property of a min heap. In a min heap, the value of a parent node should always be less than or equal to the value of its child node.
3. Repeat step 2 for all the internal nodes of the array.

Here is a Python function that implements these steps:

```python
def check_min_heap(arr):
    # Check if array is empty
    if len(arr) == 0:
        return False

    # Check if the array represents a min heap
    for i in range(len(arr) // 2 - 1, -1, -1):
        if arr[i] > arr[2 * i + 1] or (2 * i + 2 < len(arr) and arr[i] > arr[2 * i + 2]):
            return False
    return True
```

To use this function, you can pass the array you want to check as an argument, like this:

```python
print(check_min_heap([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]))  # This will return True
```

This function will return True if the array represents a min heap, and False otherwise.

Note that this function assumes that the array is a 1-based indexed array, with the first element at index 1. If your array uses a different indexing scheme, you can adjust the function accordingly.
