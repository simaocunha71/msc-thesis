To check if a given array represents a min heap or not, you can follow these steps:

1. First, define a function called `check_min_heap` that takes an array as an input.
2. Start iterating through the array from the parent nodes (starting from index `len(arr) // 2`) down to the last leaf node (index `len(arr) - 1`).
3. For each parent node, check if the left child (index `2 * i + 1`) and the right child (index `2 * i + 2`) exist. If either of them doesn't exist, check if the other child exists. If only one child exists, compare it with the parent node. If the child is smaller than the parent, the heap property is satisfied. If the child is larger than the parent, the heap property is violated, and the function should return `False`.
4. If both children exist, compare the left child with the right child. If the left child is smaller than the right child, the heap property is satisfied. If the right child is smaller than the left child, the heap property is violated, and the function should return `False`.
5. If the heap property is satisfied for all parent nodes, return `True`. Otherwise, return `False`.
6. You can use the provided `assert` statement to test the `check_min_heap` function with the given example array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, which should return `True`.

Here's an example implementation of the `check_min_heap` function in Python:

```python
def check_min_heap(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n // 2, n):
        left = 2 * i + 1
        right = 2 * i + 2
        if left >= n and right >= n:
            return True
        elif left >= n:
            if arr[i] < arr[right]:
                return True
            else:
                return False
        elif right >= n:
            if arr[i] < arr[left]:
                return True
            else:
                return False
        else:
            if arr[left] < arr[right]:
