To check if a given array represents a min heap, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to understand the properties of a min heap. A min heap is a complete binary tree where the key of each node is less than or equal to the keys of its children.

2. To check if an array is a min heap, we can iterate through each node in the array starting from the parent nodes and compare its key with the keys of its children. If any parent's key is greater than the keys of its children, then the array is not a min heap and we can return False.

3. If we iterate through all the nodes and none of them violate the min heap property, then we can conclude that the array is a min heap and return True.

Here's an example implementation of the check_min_heap function in Python:

```python
def check_min_heap(arr):
    # Iterate through each node starting from the parent nodes
    for i in range(len(arr)//2, -1, -1):
        # Get the left and right child of the node
        left_child = 2*i + 1
        right_child = 2*i + 2

        # If the node has only one child, compare it with the parent
        if left_child >= len(arr):
            if arr[i] > arr[right_child]:
                return False
        # If the node has two children, compare the average of the children with the parent
        elif right_child >= len(arr):
            if arr[i] > (arr[left_child] + arr[right_child])/2:
                return False
        # If the node has no children, it must be the root and it should be the smallest value in the heap
        elif arr[i] > min(arr[left_child], arr[right_child]):
            return False
    return True
```

You can use the check_min_heap function to check if a given array represents a min heap. For example, if you pass the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` to the function, it will return True since it is a valid min heap.
