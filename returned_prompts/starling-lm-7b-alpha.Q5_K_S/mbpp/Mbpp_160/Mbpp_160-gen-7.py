Explanation:
The function `find_solution` takes in three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `n`. It first checks if `n` is divisible by `a` using the modulo operator `%`. If it is divisible, it returns the tuple `(n//a, 0)`, which represents the solution `(x, y)` where `ax + by = n` and `x = n//a`. If `n` is not divisible by `a`, it checks if `n` is divisible by `b`. If it is, it returns the tuple `(0, n//b)`, which represents the solution `(x, y)` where `ax + by = n` and `y = n//b`. If neither `a` nor `b` is a divisor of `n`, it returns `None` to indicate that no solution exists.

The assertion `assert find_solution(2, 3, 7) == (2, 1)` tests the function with the input values `a = 2`, `b = 3`, and `n = 7`. According to the definition of the function, `n` is not divisible by `a`, but it is divisible by `b`. Therefore, the expected output is `(2, 1)`, and the assertion should pass.

This function can be used to find solutions to linear Diophantine equations of the form `ax + by = n`, where `a` and `b` are non-zero integers and `n` is an integer.

Note: The function assumes that `a` and `b` are non-zero integers. If `a` or `b` is zero, the function may not return the correct solution or may raise an error.

The time complexity of this function is O(1) because it only performs a single division operation and a single modulo operation. The space complexity is also O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of additional
