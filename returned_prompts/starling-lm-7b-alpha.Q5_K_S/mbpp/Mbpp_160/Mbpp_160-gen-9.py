    if a == 0 and b == 0 and n != 0:
        return None
    if b == 0:
        return (n / a, 0)
    if a == 0:

This function takes in three parameters, `a`, `b`, and `n`, representing the coefficients and value in the equation `ax + by = n`. It first checks if the equation is unsolvable if both `a` and `b` are 0 but `n` is not 0. Then, it checks if `b` is 0, in which case it returns a tuple with `n / a` and 0 as the solution. Similarly, if `a` is 0, it returns a tuple with 0 and `n / b` as the solution. Finally, if neither of the above conditions is met, it proceeds to solve the equation and returns a tuple with the values of `x` and `y` that satisfy the equation.

The function `find_solution` is tested with the provided assertion, which checks if the function correctly returns the solution `(2, 1)` for the given input `(2, 3, 7)`.

By using this function, you can find the integers `x` and `y` that satisfy the equation `ax + by = n` or receive `None` if no solution exists.

```python
def find_solution(a, b, n):
    if a == 0 and b == 0 and n != 0:
        return None
    if b == 0:
        return (n / a, 0)
    if a == 0:
        return (0, n / b)
    x = n / a
    y = (n - a * x) / b
    return (x, y)
```

Here's an example of how to use this function:

```python
result = find_solution(2, 3, 7)
print(result)  # Output: (2
