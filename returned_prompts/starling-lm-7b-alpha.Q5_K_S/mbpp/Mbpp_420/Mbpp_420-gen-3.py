Explanation:
The function `cube_Sum` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. It initializes a variable `sum` to store the sum of the cubes. Then it uses a for loop to iterate over the range from 1 to `2*n+1` with a step size of 2, which covers all even numbers from 1 to `2*n`. Inside the loop, it adds the cube of each even number to the `sum` variable. Finally, it returns the computed sum. The assert statement checks if the function correctly calculates the cube sum for the input `2`, and should return `True` if the function is implemented correctly.

In this case, the cube sum of the first even natural numbers (2, 4, 6, 8, ..., 2n) can be calculated by summing the cubes of these numbers. The cube of an even number is always divisible by 4. Therefore, the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers is equal to the sum of the cubes of the first n even numbers, which can be calculated using the formula (n/2)^2 * (2^3) = n^2 * 8.

To verify the function, you can use the assert statement to check if `cube_Sum(2)` returns the correct result. The assert statement is a debugging aid in Python that checks if a condition is true and raises an error if the condition is false. In this case, the condition is `cube_Sum(2) == 72`, which should be true if the function is implemented correctly. If the condition is false, an error will be raised, indicating that there is a bug in the function.

Overall, the function `cube_Sum` provides a correct implementation to calculate the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers, and the assert statement helps ensure the correctness of the function by verifying the result for a specific input (in this case, n=2).
