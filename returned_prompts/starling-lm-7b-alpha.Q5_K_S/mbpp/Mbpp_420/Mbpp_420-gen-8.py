def cube_Sum(n):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(1,n+1,2):
        sum += i**3
    return sum
```

Explanation:

In the above program, the function `cube_Sum` takes an argument `n` to find the cube sum of first `n` even natural numbers. It initializes a variable `sum` with the value 0. Then a `for` loop is used to iterate through the range from 1 to `n+1` with a step of 2. In each iteration, the cube of the current number `i` is added to the `sum` variable. Finally, the `sum` is returned as the result.

The `assert` statement is used to check if the function `cube_Sum` returns the expected result when given the input 2. If the assertion is true, the program will continue to execute; otherwise, an error will be raised.

By calling `cube_Sum(2)`, the function will calculate the cube sum of the first 2 even natural numbers (2 and 4) and return the result, which is 72.

Overall, this program defines a function that calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers and checks if the result is correct when `n` is 2.

```
def cube_Sum(n):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(1,n+1,2):
        sum += i**3
    return sum

# Testing the function
assert cube_Sum(2) == 72
```
