In the given problem, we are asked to create a function to find the sum of the cube of the first n even natural numbers.

We can use list comprehension to generate all the even numbers from 1 to n and cube them. Then, we can use the built-in Python function sum() to calculate the sum of all these cubes.

The function `cube_Sum(n)` takes an argument `n`, which represents the number of even natural numbers we want to find the sum of their cubes. If `n` is less than 1, the function returns. Otherwise, it calculates and returns the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers.

To test the function, we call `cube_Sum(2)` and print the result. The expected output is `72`, which is the sum of the cubes of the first two even natural numbers (2 and 4).

This implementation correctly solves the problem and returns the desired result.

Note: In Python, list comprehension is a concise way to create lists based on existing lists. In this case, we use it to generate a list of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers.

The time complexity of this function is O(n) because we iterate over all the even natural numbers from 1 to `n` to calculate their cubes. The space complexity is also O(n) because we create a list to store the cubes of the numbers.

In terms of Big O notation, the time complexity of O(n) means that the running time of the function grows linearly with the input size, and the space complexity of O(n) means that the space used by the function grows linearly with the input size.

It's important to note that Python does not have native support for Big O notation. However, it's a useful concept to understand the efficiency of algorithms and the resources they consume.

In Python, we can use list comprehension to create a list based on an existing list. In
