In this Python code, a function called `cube_Sum` is defined to find the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. The function takes one parameter, `n`, which represents the number of even natural numbers to be considered.

Inside the function, a variable `sum_n` is initialized to 0. Then, a `for` loop is used to iterate through the even numbers from 2 to `2*n + 1` (inclusive) with a step of 2. For each even number `i` in this range, its cube `(i**3)` is added to the `sum_n` variable.

Finally, the function returns the calculated `sum_n` as the result.

The provided assertion `assert cube_Sum(2) == 72` is used to verify the correctness of the function. It checks if the `cube_Sum` function called with the argument `2` returns the expected result of `72`. If the assertion is true, it means that the function is working correctly.

To test the function with a different value of `n`, you can call the `cube_Sum` function with the desired value as an argument. For example, `cube_Sum(3)` would calculate the cube sum of the first 3 even natural numbers.

Overall, this Python code provides a straightforward solution to finding the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers using a simple loop and basic arithmetic operations.

Note: The assertion in the code is a way to test the correctness of the function. It is not necessary to include this assertion in your own implementation, but it can be helpful for debugging and verifying the correctness of your code.

Additionally, it's worth mentioning that the range of even numbers in the loop can be simplified to `range(2, 2*n + 1, 2)` instead of `range(2, n*2 + 1
