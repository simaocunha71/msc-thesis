"""
Explanation:
The n'th lucas number can be calculated using the following recurrence relation:
lucas(n) = lucas(n - 1) + lucas(n - 2)
This relation can be used to calculate the n'th lucas number in a bottom-up manner.
The function finds the n'th lucas number by adding the (n - 1)th and (n - 2)th lucas numbers.
