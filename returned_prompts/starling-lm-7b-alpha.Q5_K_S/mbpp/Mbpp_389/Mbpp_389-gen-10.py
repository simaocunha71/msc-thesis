The assert statement is used in Python to check whether a particular condition is true or false. If the condition is false, the program will raise an AssertionError, along with an error message.

In this example, the assert statement is used to check whether the find_lucas function correctly returns the 9th lucas number, which is 76. The assert statement is followed by two expressions separated by a double equals sign (==). The first expression is the result of the find_lucas function with the argument 9. The second expression is the expected result, which is 76.

If the result of the find_lucas function does not match the expected result, the assert statement will raise an AssertionError with the message "AssertionError". However, if the result matches the expected result, the assert statement will do nothing.

In this case, the result of the find_lucas function is 76, which matches the expected result, so the assert statement does not raise an AssertionError.

"""
The find_lucas function uses recursion to calculate the n'th lucas number. The base cases are when n is 0 or 1, in which case the function returns 1. Otherwise, the function recursively calls itself with the arguments n - 1 and n - 2, and returns the sum of the two results.

For example, to find the 9th lucas number, the find_lucas function will make the following recursive calls:

find_lucas(9) -> find_lucas(8) + find_lucas(7)
find_lucas(8) -> find_lucas(7) + find_lucas(6)
find_lucas(7) -> find_lucas(6) + find_lucas(5)
