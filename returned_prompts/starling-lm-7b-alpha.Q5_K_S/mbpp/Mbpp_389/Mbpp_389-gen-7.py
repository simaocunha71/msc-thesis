"""
The above program will return the n'th lucas number using recursive approach.
This program will give you the answer of the given assertion.

"""
To check the assertion, we can define a function called find_lucas, which takes a number n as an argument. Inside the function, we can use a base case to handle the scenarios when n is 0 or 1, as the 0'th and 1'th lucas numbers are the same as their index. For all other cases, we can calculate the lucas number by recursively calling the find_lucas function with n-1 and n-2 as arguments, and adding the results. Finally, we can call the find_lucas function with the argument 9 and print the result, which should be 76, as per the assertion.

"""
In the given assertion, we are asked to write a function to find the n'th lucas number. The lucas numbers are a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 2. The first few lucas numbers are 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76, ...

To solve this problem, we can define a function called find_lucas, which takes a number n as an argument. Inside the function, we can use a base case to handle the scenarios when n is 0 or 1, as the 0'th and 1'st lucas numbers are the same as their index. For all other cases, we can calculate the lucas number by recursively calling the find_lucas function with n-1 and n-2 as arguments, and adding the results. Finally, we can call the find_lucas function with the argument 9 and print the result, which should be 76, as per the assertion.
