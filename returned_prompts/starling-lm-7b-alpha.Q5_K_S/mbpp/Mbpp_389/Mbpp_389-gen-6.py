```
# The first few terms of the Lucas sequence are: 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76, ...
def find_lucas(n):
    # Initialize the first two terms
    a, b = 2, 1
    # Iterate over the remaining terms
    while n > 0:
        # Calculate the next term
        c = a + b
        # Update the terms
        a, b = b, c
        # Subtract the current term
        n -= 1
    return c
```

This code defines a function `find_lucas` which takes an integer `n` as input and returns the `n`'th Lucas number. The function uses a while loop to iterate over the remaining terms of the Lucas sequence, updating the terms `a` and `b` until the desired `n`'th term is reached. The function then returns the calculated Lucas number. The provided assertion tests the correctness of the function by checking if `find_lucas(9)` returns the expected value of 76.

To use this function, you can simply call it with the desired value of `n` as an argument. For example, `find_lucas(10)` will return the 10'th Lucas number.

Overall, this function provides an efficient way to calculate the `n`'th Lucas number using a simple while loop and recursive update of the terms.

Here are some additional notes on the code:

- The initial values of `a` and `b` are set to the first two terms of the Lucas sequence, which are 2 and 1 respectively.
- The while loop continues until `n` becomes 0, as we need to subtract 1 from `n` in each iteration.
- In each iteration, the next term `c` is calculated by adding the current terms `a` and `b`.
- The current terms `a` and `b` are then updated to the next terms in the sequence, by assigning `b` to `a` and `c` to `b`.
- Finally, the calculated Lucas number is returned as the result of the function.

I hope this helps
