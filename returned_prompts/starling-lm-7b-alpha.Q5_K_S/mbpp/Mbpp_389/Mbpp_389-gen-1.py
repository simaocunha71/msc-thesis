Explanation:
The Lucas sequence is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 2 and 1. The nth Lucas number is defined as:

```
L(0) = 2
L(1) = 1
L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1
```

The time complexity of this solution is O(log n) because in the worst case, n could be the power of 2, such as 2^30, and the number of iterations in the while loop is log(n). The space complexity is O(1) because the space usage is constant regardless of the input size.

In the implementation, we initialize a and b as the first two numbers of the Lucas sequence. Then, we use a while loop to calculate the rest of the sequence, updating a and b in each iteration.

To verify the correctness of this solution, you can use the assert statement to check if the function returns the expected result for the given input, i.e., find_lucas(9) should return 76.
