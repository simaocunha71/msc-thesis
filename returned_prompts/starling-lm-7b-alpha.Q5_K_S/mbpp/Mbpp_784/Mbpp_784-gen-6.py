To find the product of first even and odd numbers in a given list, you can follow these steps:

1. Initialize two variables, even_product and odd_product, with the value 1. These variables will be used to store the product of all even and odd numbers in the list, respectively.

2. Iterate through each element in the list. For each element:

   a. Check if the element is even. You can do this by checking if the element modulus 2 is equal to 0 (i.e., element % 2 == 0). If the element is even, multiply the even_product by the element and update the even_product variable.

   b. Check if the element is odd. You can do this by checking if the element modulus 2 is equal to 1 (i.e., element % 2 == 1). If the element is odd, multiply the odd_product by the element and update the odd_product variable.

3. After iterating through all the elements in the list, calculate the product of even_product and odd_product by multiplying them together (i.e., product = even_product * odd_product).

4. Return the calculated product.

Here's an example implementation of the solution in Python:

"""
def mul_even_odd(numbers):
    even_product = 1
    odd_product = 1

    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            even_product *= num
        elif num % 2 == 1:
            odd_product *= num

    product = even_product * odd_product
    return product

# Test the function
assert mul_even_odd([1,3,5,7,4,1,6,8]) == 4

"""
This implementation of the function will find the product of the first even and odd numbers in a given list. The function uses two variables, even_product and odd_product, to store the product of all even and odd numbers, respectively. By iterating through the list and multiplying the product variables accordingly, the function calculates the desired product and returns it.
