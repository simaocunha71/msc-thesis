"""
Here is a step-by-step explanation of how you can write a function to multiply all the numbers in a list and divide with the length of the list:

1. Define a function called multiply_num that takes a list as an input parameter.
2. Initialize a variable called result and set its value to 1. This variable will hold the product of all the numbers in the list.
3. Use a for loop to iterate through each element in the list. For each element, multiply the result by the element.
4. After the loop ends, divide the result by the length of the list. You can use the built-in len() function to get the length of the list.
5. Return the result.
6. Test the function by calling it with a list of numbers, such as (8, 2, 3, -1, 7), and asserting that the result is approximately equal to -67.2 using the math.isclose() function.
7. Run the test and verify that the function returns the expected result.

    for item in lst:
        result *= item
    return result/len(lst)

assert math.isclose(multiply_num((8, 2, 3, -1, 7)), -67.2, rel_tol=0.001)
