"""
The multiplication of a list of numbers is the product of all the numbers in the list. We can implement this using a for loop to multiply all the numbers together. The length of a list is the number of elements in the list. We can implement this by using the built-in len() function. The division of two numbers is the result of dividing the first number by the second number. We can implement this using the / operator.
To solve this problem, we can define a function called multiply_num that takes a list of numbers as input. Inside the function, we initialize a variable called product to 1, which will store the multiplication of all the numbers. Then, we use a for loop to iterate over each number in the input list. For each number, we multiply it with the current value of the product variable and update the value of product. After the for loop, we divide the product by the length of the input list using the / operator and return the result.
Here is the Python code for the solution:

def multiply_num(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
    return product / len(numbers)

We can test the function by passing a list of numbers to it and using the assert statement to check if the result is close to the expected result within a tolerance of 0.001.

def multiply_num(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
    return product / len(numbers)

# Test the function
assert math.isclose(multiply_num((8, 2, 3, -1, 7)), -67.2, rel_tol=0.001)

# Further test cases
print(multiply_num((3, -2, 7, 0)))  # Expected result: 0.0
print(multiply_num((1, 2, 3, 4, 5)))  # Expected result: 120.0
print(multiply_num((-1, -2, -3, -4, -5)))  # Expected result: -120.0
print(multiply_num((0, 0, 0)))  # Ex
