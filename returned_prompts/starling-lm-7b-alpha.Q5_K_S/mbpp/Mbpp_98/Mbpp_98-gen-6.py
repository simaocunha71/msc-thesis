```python
import math

def multiply_num(input_list):
    # Initialize result
    result = 1

    # Multiply all the numbers
    for num in input_list:
        result *= num

    # Divide by the length of the list
    result /= len(input_list)

    return result
```

Here is the function to multiply all the numbers in a list and divide with the length of the list:

```python
def multiply_num(input_list):
    # Initialize result
    result = 1

    # Multiply all the numbers
    for num in input_list:
        result *= num

    # Divide by the length of the list
    result /= len(input_list)

    return result
```

To test the function, you can use the `math.isclose()` function to verify the result:

```python
assert math.isclose(multiply_num((8, 2, 3, -1, 7)), -67.2, rel_tol=0.001)
```

This will compare the result of the `multiply_num()` function with the expected result `-67.2` within a relative tolerance of `0.001`.

The `rel_tol` parameter in `math.isclose()` is used to specify the relative tolerance for the comparison. In this case, it means that the absolute difference between the actual result and the expected result should be less than `0.001` times the magnitude of the expected result.

Using the `math.isclose()` function ensures that the result is approximately equal to the expected result within the specified tolerance, providing a reliable way to verify the correctness of the function.

Overall, the `multiply_num()` function multiplies all the numbers in a list and divides the result by the length of the list, and the provided test asserts that the result is close to `-67.2` within the specified tolerance.
