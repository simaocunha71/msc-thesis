The function `multiply_num` takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the product of all the numbers in the list divided by the length of the list. The `math.isclose` function is used to check if the result of the function is approximately equal to `-67.2` with a relative tolerance of `0.001`. The `sum` function is used to calculate the sum of all the numbers in the list, and the `len` function is used to calculate the length of the list.

The expected output of the function is `-67.2`, which is the product of all the numbers in the list divided by the length of the list, rounded to two decimal places. The `math.isclose` function is used to check if the result of the function is approximately equal to `-67.2` with a relative tolerance of `0.001`. This means that the actual result should be within `0.001` of `-67.2` for the assertion to pass.

In the provided code, the `multiply_num` function is called with the list `(8, 2, 3, -1, 7)` as an argument. The result of the function is then printed to the console.

The expected output of the code is `-67.2`, which is the product of all the numbers in the list divided by the length of the list, rounded to two decimal places.

Here's how the code works step by step:

1. The `multiply_num` function is defined with a single argument `nums`, which represents the list of numbers.
2. The `sum` function is used to calculate the sum of all the numbers in the list `nums`.
3. The `len` function is used to calculate the length of the list `nums`.
4. The product of all the numbers in the list is divided by the length of the list, and the result is returned by the `multiply_num` function.
5. The `math.isclose` function is used to check if the result of
