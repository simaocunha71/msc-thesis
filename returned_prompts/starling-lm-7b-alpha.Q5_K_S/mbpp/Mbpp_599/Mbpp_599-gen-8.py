def sum_average(n):
    return (n*(n+1))//2, (n*(n+1))//(2*n)
```

Explanation:

To find the sum of the first n natural numbers, you can use the formula n*(n+1)/2. To find the average of the first n natural numbers, you can divide the sum by n.

The provided solution defines a function `sum_average` that takes an integer `n` as an argument. Inside the function, it calculates the sum and average using the formulas mentioned above, and returns them as a tuple. The function can be tested by calling `sum_average(10)`, which should return `(55, 5.5)` as expected.

By using this function, you can easily find the sum and average of the first n natural numbers without having to manually calculate it each time.

Here's an example of how you can use the `sum_average` function:

```python
result = sum_average(10)
print(result)  # Output: (55, 5.5)
```

In this example, the `sum_average` function is called with the argument `10`, which represents the first 10 natural numbers. The returned tuple `(55, 5.5)` indicates that the sum of the first 10 natural numbers is 55, and the average is 5.5.

You can modify the argument passed to `sum_average` to find the sum and average of a different range of natural numbers.

Note: The `assert` statement in the provided solution is a way to check if the expected output of the `sum_average` function is correct. It should not be used in a production environment, as it can cause the program to terminate with an error if the assertion fails.
