```
def sum_average(n):
    sum = (n * (n + 1)) // 2
    average = sum / n
    return sum, average
```

Here's a Python function that finds the sum and average of the first n natural numbers. It uses a simple arithmetic formula to calculate the sum of an arithmetic series, and then divides the sum by the number of terms to find the average. The function returns a tuple containing both the sum and the average.

The `assert` statement at the end of the code is used to verify that the function correctly calculates the sum and average for a specific input (in this case, 10). If the function's output does not match the expected result, an `AssertionError` will be raised, indicating that there is an error in the function's implementation.

In the provided code, the function `sum_average` takes a single parameter `n`, which represents the number of natural numbers to consider. The function first calculates the sum of the first n natural numbers using the formula `(n * (n + 1)) // 2`. This formula is derived from the arithmetic series formula, where the sum of the first n natural numbers is equal to the average of the first and last number, multiplied by the number of terms.

Next, the function calculates the average by dividing the sum by the number of terms (n). The result is stored in the variable `average`. Finally, the function returns a tuple containing both the sum and the average.

To test the function, the provided `assert` statement checks if the function correctly calculates the sum and average for the input `n = 10`. If the function's output does not match the expected result (in this case, `(55, 5.5)`), an `AssertionError` will be raised, indicating that there is an error in the function's implementation.

Overall, this code defines a function that can find the sum and average of the first n natural numbers, and includes a test case to verify its correctness.

```python
def sum_average(n):
    sum = (n * (n + 1)) // 2
    average = sum / n
    return sum, average
