```
def sum_average(n):
    summ = n * (n + 1) / 2
    avg = summ / n
    return summ, avg
```

Explanation:

The sum of the first n natural numbers is given by the formula n*(n+1)/2. 
To find the average, we divide the sum by n.

To verify that the function works correctly, we can use the `assert` keyword to compare the result of the function with the expected value. In this case, we expect the function to return (55, 5.5) when given the argument 10.

The function `sum_average` takes an argument `n` and calculates the sum and average of the first n natural numbers using the formula mentioned above. It returns the sum and average as a tuple.

By using the `assert` keyword, we can check that the function's result matches the expected value. If the assertion fails, an `AssertionError` will be raised.

In this case, the assertion `assert sum_average(10)==(55, 5.5)` will pass, indicating that the function correctly calculates the sum and average of the first 10 natural numbers.

It's important to note that the `assert` keyword is a debugging aid and is typically used in production code only when it's necessary to ensure the correctness of certain conditions.

Here's an example usage of the function:

```python
result = sum_average(10)
print(result)  # Output: (55, 5.5)
```

This will output the sum and average of the first 10 natural numbers, which are (55, 5.5).

In summary, the `sum_average` function correctly calculates the sum and average of the first n natural numbers using the provided formula and returns the result as a tuple.

The `assert` statement is used to verify the correctness of the function's result, ensuring that it matches the expected value.

```python
def sum_average(n):
    summ = n * (n + 1) // 2
    avg = summ / n
