"""
The purpose of this exercise is to:
1. Implement a function that takes in three numbers.
2. Sort the numbers in ascending order.
3. Return the median of the three numbers.

"""
Explanation:

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:
1. Sort the numbers in ascending order. This can be done using the built-in function sorted().
2. Calculate the median by taking the average of the two middle numbers.
3. Return the median.

In the provided code, the function median_numbers takes three parameters a, b, and c, which represent the three numbers to find the median of. Inside the function, the numbers are sorted using the sorted() function and assigned back to the variables a, b, and c. Then, the median is calculated by taking the average of the two middle numbers, which are a and b, and returned as the result.

To test the function, several test cases are provided. The function is called with different sets of numbers as arguments, and the expected median is printed using the print() function. For example, the function is called with the arguments 25, 55, and 65, and the expected median
