Here's a Python function that solves the problem:

```python
def even_Power_Sum(n):
    return sum([i**5 for i in range(2, 2 + n)])
```

This function uses a list comprehension to generate a list of the first `n` even natural numbers (starting with 2) raised to the fifth power. It then uses the built-in `sum()` function to add up all the values in the list and return the result.

For example, if you call `even_Power_Sum(2)`, the function will generate the list `[2^5, 3^5, 4^5, ...]` and sum up all the values to get `1056`.

```python
def test_even_Power_Sum():
    assert even_Power_Sum(2) == 1056

test_even_Power_Sum()
```

This test case verifies that the function correctly calculates the sum of the first 2 even natural numbers raised to the fifth power, which is indeed `1056`.

```python
def even_Power_Sum(n):
    return sum([i**5 for i in range(2, 2 + n)])
```
