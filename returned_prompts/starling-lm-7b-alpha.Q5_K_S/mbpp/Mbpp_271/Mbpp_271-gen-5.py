Here's one way you can define the function:

```python
def even_Power_Sum(n):
    # Initialize the sum to 0
    sum = 0
    # Iterate through the first n even numbers
    for i in range(2, 2 * n + 1, 2):
        # Add the square of each number to the sum
        sum += i ** 5
    # Return the sum
    return sum
```

To test the function with the provided example, you can use the following code:

```python
print(even_Power_Sum(2) == 1056)
```

This will print `True` if the function is correctly implemented, and `False` otherwise.

```python
def even_Power_Sum(n):
    # Initialize the sum to 0
    sum = 0
    # Iterate through the first n even numbers
    for i in range(2, 2 * n + 1, 2):
        # Add the square of each number to the sum
        sum += i ** 5
    # Return the sum
    return sum
```

To test the function with the provided example, you can use the following code:

```python
print(even_Power_Sum(2) == 1056)
```

This will print `True` if the function is correctly implemented, and `False` otherwise.

```python
def even_Power_Sum(n):
    # Initialize the sum to 0
    sum = 0
    # Iterate through the first n even numbers
    for i in range(2, 2 * n + 1, 2):
        # Add the square of each number to the sum
        sum += i ** 5
    # Return the sum
    return sum
```
