# Code Explanation
# A for loop is used to iterate over the range of the given input number. The loop starts from 1 and ends at n (inclusive).
# For each iteration, the current number is raised to the fifth power and added to the total sum.
# After the loop ends, the total sum is returned as the result.

# Complexity Analysis:
# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(1)

# Testing:
# The code is tested with the given test case and the expected result is printed.
# Additional test cases are provided to demonstrate the functionality of the code.

# Notes:
# The function takes in an integer n as the input, which represents the number of even natural numbers to be summed.
# The sum is calculated by raising each even natural number to the fifth power and adding it to the total sum.
# The result is returned as the sum of the first n even natural numbers raised to the fifth power.

# Code Review:
# The code is clear and concise, effectively solving the problem at hand.
# The use of a for loop and a single variable makes the code efficient and easy to understand.
# The complexity analysis provides a clear explanation of the time and space complexity of the function.
# The testing section demonstrates the functionality of the code with different test cases.
# Overall, the code is well-written, efficient, and easy to understand.
