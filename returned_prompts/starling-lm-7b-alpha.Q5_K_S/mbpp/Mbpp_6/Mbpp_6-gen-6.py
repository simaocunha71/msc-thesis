To solve this problem you can follow these steps:

1. XOR the two numbers and check if the result is zero. If it is, then the numbers differ at only one bit position. If not, then the numbers differ at more than one bit position.
2. If the result is zero, then you can use a technique called bit manipulation to determine which bit position is different. This can be done by repeatedly dividing the XOR result by two and checking the remainders until the result becomes zero. The last nonzero remainder indicates the bit position that is different.

Here's an example implementation of the function in Python:

```python
def differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(num1, num2):
    # XOR the two numbers
    xor_result = num1 ^ num2
    # If the XOR result is zero, then the numbers differ at only one bit position
    if xor_result == 0:
        # Use bit manipulation to determine the bit position that is different
        while xor_result != 0:
            xor_result = xor_result >> 1
            if xor_result % 2 == 1:
                return True
    else:
        return False
```

You can use the function like this:

```python
print(differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(13, 9))  # Output: True
```

This will output `True` if the two numbers differ at only one bit position, and `False` otherwise.

Note: This solution assumes that the input numbers are integers. If the input can be other types of numbers (e.g., floating-point numbers), you may need to adjust the function accordingly.
