"""
The function median_trapezium takes three arguments: the lengths of the trapezium's two parallel sides and the length of the median. It calculates the median length by taking the average of the three lengths. The function then returns the median length. The function is tested by asserting that the median_trapezium function returns the correct median length for the given trapezium lengths.

The function median_trapezium is defined to find the median length of a trapezium. It takes three arguments: the lengths of the trapezium's two parallel sides and the length of the median. It calculates the median length by taking the average of the three lengths and then returns the median length. The function is tested by asserting that the median_trapezium function returns the correct median length for the given trapezium lengths, which is 20.

The function median_trapezium is a correct implementation of the problem's requirements and the test assertion confirms that the function is correct.
