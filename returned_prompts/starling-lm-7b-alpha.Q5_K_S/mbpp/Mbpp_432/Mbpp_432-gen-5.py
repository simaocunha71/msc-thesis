"""
The median of a trapezium is the line segment joining the two nonparallel sides, and it is the midpoint of the sum of the lengths of these two sides.

The length of the median can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that for any right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

The length of the median is equal to half of the sum of the lengths of the two nonparallel sides.
"""

"""
The median of a trapezium can be found by taking the average of the lengths of the two nonparallel sides. This can be done by adding the lengths of the two nonparallel sides and dividing the sum by two.
"""

"""
In this case, the median of a trapezium can be calculated by adding the lengths of the two nonparallel sides and dividing the sum by two. This can be done using the formula (b + c)/2, where b and c are the lengths of the two nonparallel sides.
