Here's a Python function that takes in an integer and checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. The function `validate` uses a while loop to convert the input integer into a list of its digits. Then, it uses the `all` function and a generator expression to check if all pairs of adjacent elements in the list satisfy the condition `x <= y`, where `x` is the current element and `y` is the next element. If all pairs satisfy the condition, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

For example, if we call `validate(1234)`, it will return True because the frequency of each digit in the number 1234 (1, 2, 3, 4) is less than or equal to the digit itself (1, 2, 3, 4).

Note that this function assumes that the input is a valid integer. If you want to handle invalid inputs as well, you may need to add additional error handling code.

Here's a Python function that takes in an integer and checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself:

```python
def validate(num):
    lst = []
    while num > 0:
        lst.append(num % 10)
        num //= 10
    return all(x <= y for x, y in zip(lst, lst[1:]))
```

You can use this function to check if the frequency of each digit in a number is less than or equal to the digit itself. For example, if you call `validate(1234)`, it will return True because the frequency of each digit in the number 1234 (1, 2, 3, 4) is less than or equal to the digit itself (1, 2, 3, 4).
