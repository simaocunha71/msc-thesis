Here's a Python function that takes in an integer `n` and returns the sum of the squares of the first `n` odd natural numbers:

```python
def square_Sum(n):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(1, 2 * n + 1, 2):
        sum += i ** 2
    return sum
```

To test the function, you can use the `assert` statement as follows:

```python
assert square_Sum(2) == 10
```

The `assert` statement checks if the condition on the left-hand side (`square_Sum(2) == 10`) is true. If the condition is true, the program continues to execute the subsequent lines. If the condition is false, the program raises an `AssertionError` with an error message.

In this case, the `square_Sum(2)` function call returns `10`, which is equal to the expected result `10`, so the `assert` statement does not raise an error and the program continues to execute without any issues.

You can run this code in a Python environment to verify the correctness of the function.

```python
def square_Sum(n):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(1, 2 * n + 1, 2):
        sum += i ** 2
    return sum

assert square_Sum(2) == 10
```

This code will output `True` if the assertion is true, indicating that the `square_Sum` function correctly computes the sum of the squares of the first `n` odd natural numbers.

The `square_Sum` function uses a `for` loop to iterate through the range of odd numbers from `1` to `2 * n + 1` (exclusive), with a step size of `2`. For each odd number `i` in the range, it calculates the square `i ** 2` and adds it to the `sum` variable. Finally, it returns the accumulated sum.

By using the `range` function with a step size of `2`, we ensure that only odd numbers are included in the iteration. The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from the first parameter (
