```
def square_Sum(n):
    return sum([i**2 for i in range(1, 2*n, 2)])
```

Here's how this function works:

- We use a list comprehension to generate the first `n` odd natural numbers. The expression `range(1, 2*n, 2)` generates the sequence `[1, 3, 5, 7, ..., 2n-1]`.
- We then use Python's built-in `sum` function to calculate the sum of squares of this sequence. The expression `[i**2 for i in range(1, 2*n, 2)]` generates the sequence `[1, 9, 25, 49, ..., (2n-1)**2]`.
- The function returns the sum of the squares of this sequence.

The `assert` statement is a debugging tool in Python that checks if a condition is true. In this case, it is used to verify that the `square_Sum` function works correctly for the test case `n = 2`.

To test the function, you can call it with different values of `n` and check if the result matches the expected output. For example, `square_Sum(3)` should return `46`, which is the sum of the squares of the first three odd natural numbers (`1^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 = 1 + 9 + 25 = 46`).

Overall, this function provides an efficient way to calculate the sum of the squares of the first `n` odd natural numbers in Python.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to use this function:

1. Define the function `square_Sum` that takes an integer `n` as input.
2. Inside the function, use a list comprehension to generate the sequence of the first `n` odd natural numbers. The `range` function is used to generate this sequence, starting from `1` and incrementing by `2` (since odd numbers have a step of `2`), up to `2n-1`.
3. Use Python's built-in `sum` function to calculate the sum of squares of this sequence. The `
