def square_Sum(n):
    return n*(n+1)**2//2
```

Explanation:

The function `square_Sum` takes an integer `n` as an input. It uses the formula for the sum of the squares of the first n odd natural numbers, which is `n*(n+1)**2//2`. The formula is derived from the formula for the sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers, which is `n*(n+1)*(2n+1)//6`, and subtracting the sum of the squares of the first n even natural numbers, which is `n*(n+1)//2`. Since each odd number can be expressed as `2n+1`, and each even number can be expressed as `2n`, the sum of the squares of the first n odd natural numbers can be expressed as `n*(n+1)**2//2`.

The function then returns the result of evaluating this formula with the input `n`.

The assertion `assert square_Sum(2) == 10` checks if the function `square_Sum` correctly calculates the sum of the squares of the first 2 odd natural numbers, which is 10.

This code will pass the test if the function is correctly implemented.

```python
def square_Sum(n):
    return n*(n+1)**2//2
```

```python
assert square_Sum(2) == 10
```

This code defines a function `square_Sum` that takes an integer `n` as an input and returns the sum of the squares of the first `n` odd natural numbers. The function uses the formula `n*(n+1)**2//2` to calculate this sum. The assertion `assert square_Sum(2) == 10` checks if the function correctly calculates the sum of the squares of the first 2 odd natural numbers, which is 10.
