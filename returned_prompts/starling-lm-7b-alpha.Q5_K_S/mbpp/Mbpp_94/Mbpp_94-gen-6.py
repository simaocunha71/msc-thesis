To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize a variable `min_value` with a value of positive infinity.
2. Initialize a variable `min_index` with a value of `None`.
3. Iterate over the list of tuples.
4. For each tuple, check if the second value is smaller than `min_value`. If it is, update `min_value` and `min_index` with the second value and the index of the tuple, respectively.
5. After iterating through all tuples, return the first value of the tuple with the smallest second value.

Here's a Python function that implements this logic:

```python
def index_minimum(lst):
    min_value = float('inf')
    min_index = None
    for i, (value, index) in enumerate(lst):
        if value < min_value:
            min_value = value
            min_index = index
    return min_index
```

You can use the `index_minimum` function with a list of tuples to find the first value of the tuple with the smallest second value. In the given example, `index_minimum([('Rash', 143), ('Manjeet', 200), ('Varsha', 100)])` will return `'Varsha'` since the tuple `('Varsha', 100)` has the smallest second value among all the tuples.

```python
index_minimum([('Rash', 143), ('Manjeet', 200), ('Varsha', 100)])  # Returns 'Varsha'
```

This function will work with any list of tuples, as long as each tuple has at least two values.

```python
index_minimum([('Rash', 143), ('Manjeet', 200), ('Varsha', 100), ('Alice', 90)])  # Returns 'Alice'
```
