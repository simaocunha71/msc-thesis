Python Function to Find Even Numbers from a List

In this Python function, we are going to use a for loop to iterate through the given list of numbers. For each number in the list, we will check if it is divisible by 2 (i.e., an even number). If the number is divisible by 2, we will append it to a new list called "res". Finally, we will return the "res" list containing all the even numbers from the input list.

Here is the Python code for the function:

```python
def Split(l):
    res = []
    for i in l:
        if i%2==0:
            res.append(i)
    return res
```

To test the function, you can use the provided assert statement:

```python
assert Split([1,2,3,4,5]) == [2,4]
```

This assert statement checks if the function returns the expected result for the input list `[1,2,3,4,5]`. If the function correctly identifies and returns the even numbers from the input list, the assert statement will pass and no error will be raised.

By using this function, you can easily find and extract even numbers from a given list of numbers in Python.
