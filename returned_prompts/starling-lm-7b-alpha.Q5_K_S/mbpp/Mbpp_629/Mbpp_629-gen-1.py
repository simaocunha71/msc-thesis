```
def Split(l):
    return [i for i in l if i % 2 == 0]
```

Explanation:

Here, In the given list of numbers, we need to return the even numbers.
For the given list of numbers [1,2,3,4,5],
Even numbers are 2 and 4.

So, the Python function to find even numbers from a list of numbers can be written as follows:

```python
def Split(l):
    return [i for i in l if i % 2 == 0]
```

Here, `i % 2 == 0` is used to check whether the number is even or not.
If `i % 2` is equal to 0, it means the number is even.

By using List comprehension, we can return all the even numbers from the given list.

The above Python function can be tested with the given assert statement as follows:

```python
assert Split([1,2,3,4,5]) == [2,4]
```

This assert statement checks whether the Python function `Split` returns the correct even numbers from the given list of numbers or not.

If the Python function `Split` returns the correct even numbers, the assert statement will be True.
```

As a result, the above Python function `Split` can be used to find even numbers from a list of numbers.

```python
def Split(l):
    return [i for i in l if i % 2 == 0]
```

The above Python function can be used as follows to get the even numbers from a given list of numbers:

```python
numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]
even_numbers = Split(numbers)
print(even_numbers)
```

This will give the following output:

```python
[2,4]
```

So, the above Python function can be used to find even numbers from a list of numbers.

```python
def Split(l):
    return [i for i in l if i % 2 == 0]
```
```

The above Python
