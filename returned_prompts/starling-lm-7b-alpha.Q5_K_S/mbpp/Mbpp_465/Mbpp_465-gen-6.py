```python
def drop_empty(d):
    return {key:value for key,value in d.items() if value is not None}
```

Explanation:
This function drops the empty items from a dictionary and returns a new dictionary.

It uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary that only includes the key-value pairs where the value is not `None`.

The `items()` method returns a view object that displays a list of a dictionary's key-value tuple pairs. The comprehension uses `key, value` to unpack each tuple and check if the value is not `None` before including it in the new dictionary.

This function is useful when you want to drop empty items from a dictionary, such as when the dictionary is created from user input or external sources where `None` values may appear.

```python
drop_empty({'c1': 'Red', 'c2': 'Green', 'c3':None})  # Returns: {'c1': 'Red', 'c2': 'Green'}
```
This assertion confirms that the function correctly drops the empty item from the dictionary.

The `drop_empty` function can be used to remove empty items from a dictionary in Python.

For example, consider a dictionary with a value of `None`:

```python
d = {'c1': 'Red', 'c2': 'Green', 'c3':None}
```

By applying the `drop_empty` function to this dictionary, the `None` value is dropped, resulting in a dictionary without the empty item:

```python
drop_empty(d)  # Returns: {'c1': 'Red', 'c2': 'Green'}
```

This can be useful in scenarios where you want to process a dictionary that may contain empty values.

The function achieves this by using a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary that only includes the key-value pairs where the value is not `None`. This ensures that the resulting dictionary does not contain any empty items.

It's important to note that the function does not modify the original dictionary, but instead returns a new dictionary with the empty items dropped. This allows you to work with the original dictionary while still obtaining the desired result.

In conclusion, the `drop_empty
