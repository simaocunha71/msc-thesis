```
def drop_empty(d):
    return {k: v for k, v in d.items() if v is not None}
```

Explanation:
In the dictionary comprehension, we iterate over the key-value pairs of the dictionary. For each key-value pair, we check if the value is not `None`. If the value is not `None`, we include the key-value pair in the resulting dictionary.

This function will return a new dictionary with all the key-value pairs that have a non-`None` value, effectively dropping all the empty items from the original dictionary.

The `assert` statement at the end of the code is a way to verify the correctness of the `drop_empty` function. It checks if the function correctly drops the empty item (in this case, the key-value pair with the key `'c3'` and the value `None`) from the dictionary.

Overall, this function provides a straightforward and efficient solution to drop empty items from a dictionary.

```python
def drop_empty(d):
    return {k: v for k, v in d.items() if v is not None}
```

This function utilizes dictionary comprehension to iterate over the key-value pairs of the input dictionary `d`. For each key-value pair, it checks if the value `v` is not `None`. If the value is not `None`, it includes the key-value pair in the resulting dictionary. This effectively removes all key-value pairs with `None` values from the dictionary.

To verify the correctness of the `drop_empty` function, an `assert` statement is used. It asserts that when the `drop_empty` function is called with the dictionary `{'c1': 'Red', 'c2': 'Green', 'c3':None}`, it should return `{'c1': 'Red', 'c2': 'Green'}`. This confirms that the function correctly drops the empty item from the dictionary.

In summary, the `drop_empty` function provides a reliable and efficient means to remove empty items from a dictionary, and the `assert` statement ensures its correct implementation.

```python
def drop_empty(d):
    return {k: v for k, v in d.items() if v
