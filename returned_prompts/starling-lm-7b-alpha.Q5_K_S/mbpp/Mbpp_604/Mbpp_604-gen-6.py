```
def reverse_words(string):
    word_list = string.split(" ")
    word_list.reverse()
    return " ".join(word_list)
```

Explanation:
To reverse the words in a given string, you can follow these steps:
1. Split the string into a list of words using the split() function. In this case, we're splitting the string at each space character.
2. Use the reverse() method to reverse the order of the elements in the list.
3. Use the join() method to combine the elements of the list into a single string, with each element separated by a space character.
4. Return the resulting string.

For example, if we call the reverse_words function with the string "python program", it will split the string into a list of two words: ["python", "program"]. The reverse() method will then reverse the order of the elements in the list, so the list becomes ["program", "python"]. Finally, the join() method will combine the elements of the list into a single string with spaces between each word, resulting in the string "program python".

Here's a breakdown of the code:
- The function reverse_words takes a string as input.
- Inside the function, we use the split() method to split the string into a list of words. The split() method splits the string at each space character and returns a list of the resulting substrings.
- Next, we use the reverse() method to reverse the order of the elements in the word_list.
- Finally, we use the join() method to combine the elements of the word_list into a single string with spaces between each word. The resulting string is then returned.

By following these steps, the reverse_words function will correctly reverse the order of the words in the given string.

Note: Make sure to include the assert statement at the beginning of the code to test the function and ensure it is working correctly.

In this case, the assert statement checks if the result of the reverse_words function on the input "python program" is equal to the expected output "program python". If the result is not equal to the expected output, the assert statement will raise an AssertionError with the message "assertion error". This helps to verify that the function is working correctly and producing the expected output.
