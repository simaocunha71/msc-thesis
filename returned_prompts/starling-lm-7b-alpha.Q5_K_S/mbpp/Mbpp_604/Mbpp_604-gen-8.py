def reverse_words(sentence):
    """
    Reverse words separated by spaces in a given string
    """
    words = sentence.split(' ')
    return ' '.join(words[::-1])

# Testing
print(reverse_words("python program"))

# Expected Output:
"""
program python
"""

"""
Explanation:
The function starts by splitting the input string into a list of words using the space (' ') as a delimiter.
Then it reverses the list of words using slicing notation [::-1] and joins them back together into a string using the join() method with a space (' ') as the separator.
"""

# Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of words in the sentence
# Space Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of words in the sentence

# Note: The time and space complexity analysis assumes that the length of each word in the sentence is approximately the same.
# If the lengths of the words vary significantly, the analysis may not hold true.
