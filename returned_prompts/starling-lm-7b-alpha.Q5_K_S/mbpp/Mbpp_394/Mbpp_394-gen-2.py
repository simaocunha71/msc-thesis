"""

In the code, we use the Python built-in function all() to check if all elements in the list are the same. The all() function returns True if all elements in the iterable are true. Otherwise, it returns False.

To use all(), we convert the tuple to a list and sort it. Then, we use a list comprehension to compare each element in the list to its next element. If all elements are the same, all() will return True; otherwise, it will return False.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) because sorting a list has a time complexity of O(n log n), and checking if all elements are the same has a time complexity of O(n).

This solution also has a space complexity of O(n) because we convert the tuple to a list and sort the list.
