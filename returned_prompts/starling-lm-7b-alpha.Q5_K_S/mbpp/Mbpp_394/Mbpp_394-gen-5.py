To solve this, we can use a set to check if all items in the tuple are unique. If there are duplicate items, it means the tuple does not contain distinct items.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Define a function called `check_distinct` that takes a tuple as an argument.
2. Inside the function, convert the tuple into a set using the `set()` function. This will automatically remove any duplicate items, as sets only allow unique elements.
3. Use the `==` operator to compare the original tuple with the set. If they are equal, it means all items in the tuple are unique, so the function should return True. Otherwise, it should return False.
4. Test the function with the provided example, `check_distinct((1, 4, 5, 6, 1, 4))`, and assert that it returns False.

Here's the code that implements the solution:

def check_distinct(tup):
    return set(tup) == tup

assert check_distinct((1, 4, 5, 6, 1, 4)) == False
