To solve this problem we need to write a function that checks if a given tuple contains no duplicates. We can achieve this by converting the tuple into a set and then comparing the length of the set to the length of the original tuple.

Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Define a function called `check_distinct` that takes a tuple as an argument.
2. Convert the tuple into a set by enclosing the tuple in a set of square brackets. This will automatically remove any duplicate elements.
3. Compare the length of the set to the length of the original tuple. If they are equal, this means that there are no duplicate elements in the tuple. If they are not equal, this means that there are duplicate elements in the tuple.
4. Return `True` if the lengths are equal, and `False` otherwise.

Here's the code for the function:

```python
def check_distinct(tup):
    tup_set = {x for x in tup}
    return len(tup_set) == len(tup)
```

To test the function, you can use the `assert` statement to check if the function returns the correct result for a given tuple. For example, if you pass the tuple `(1, 4, 5, 6, 1, 4)` to the function, it should return `False` because the tuple contains duplicate elements.

Here's the complete code:

```python
def check_distinct(tup):
    tup_set = {x for x in tup}
    return len(tup_set) == len(tup)

assert check_distinct((1, 4, 5, 6, 1, 4)) == False
```

This code will print `True` if the assertion is true, and `False` otherwise.

def check_distinct(tup):
    tup_set = {x for x in tup}
    return len(tup_set) == len(tup)

assert check_distinct((1, 4, 5, 6, 1, 4)) == False
```

This code will print `True
