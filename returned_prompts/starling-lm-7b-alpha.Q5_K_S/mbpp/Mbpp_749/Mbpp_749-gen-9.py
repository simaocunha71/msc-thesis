Explanation:
The `sorted()` function in Python is used to sort a given list. In this case, we want to sort the list of strings of numbers numerically, which means we want to sort them based on their integer value, rather than their ASCII value. To do this, we use the `key` parameter of the `sorted()` function, which takes a function that is used to determine the sort order. In this case, we use the `int` function as the key function, which converts each string to an integer. This allows us to sort the strings based on their integer value, rather than their ASCII value.

The `key` parameter of the `sorted()` function is a function that is used to determine the sort order. In this case, we use the `int` function as the key function, which converts each string to an integer. This allows us to sort the strings based on their integer value, rather than their ASCII value.

Finally, the `return` statement is used to return the sorted list of strings of numbers.

Here is an example usage of the `sort_numeric_strings()` function:
```python
assert sort_numeric_strings( ['4','12','45','7','0','100','200','-12','-500'])==[-500, -12, 0, 4, 7, 12, 45, 100, 200]
```
In this example, we are sorting the list `['4','12','45','7','0','100','200','-12','-500']` numerically and asserting that the output is `[-500, -12, 0, 4, 7, 12, 45, 100, 200]`.

The assertion checks that the actual output of the `sort_numeric_strings()` function matches the expected output. If the assertion fails, an `AssertionError` will be raised.

In this case, the
