```
In this Python program, a function called "sort_numeric_strings" is defined. The function takes a list of strings called "num_list" as its input. The function uses the built-in Python function "sorted" to sort the strings in the "num_list" in ascending order. The "key" parameter of the "sorted" function is set to "int", which means the sorting is based on the numerical value of the strings. The sorted list is then returned by the function.

To test the function, an assert statement is used to check if the function correctly sorts the given list of strings. If the assert statement passes, it means the function is working correctly. The message "The 'assert' statement passed." is printed to indicate that the test was successful.

Finally, the program ends without any error.
