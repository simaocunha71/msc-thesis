"""
This code defines a function called `last_Digit_Factorial` that takes in a parameter `n`. It uses recursion to calculate the factorial of `n` and returns the last digit of the result.

The function first checks if `n` is equal to 0. If it is, it returns 1, as the factorial of 0 is defined as 1. Otherwise, it calculates the factorial of `n` by multiplying `n` with the factorial of `n-1`, and taking the modulo 10 of the result. This ensures that the function only returns the last digit of the factorial.

The driver code then calls the `last_Digit_Factorial` function with the argument 4 and prints the result, which should be 4.
