"""
The above code defines a function called return_sum that takes a dictionary as an argument. It initializes a variable sum to zero. It then loops over all the values in the dictionary and adds them to the sum. Finally, it returns the sum. 

The function test_return_sum is defined to test the return_sum function. It calls the return_sum function with a dictionary {'a': 100, 'b':200, 'c':300} and asserts that the returned value is equal to 600. 

To use the function, you can call return_sum with your own dictionary of values and it will return the sum of all the values in the dictionary.
