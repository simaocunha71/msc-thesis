```
def get_coordinates(coords):
    left = coords[0] - 1
    right = coords[0] + 1
    up = coords[1] + 1
    down = coords[1] - 1
    return [[left, coords[1]], [right, coords[1]], [coords[0], down], [coords[0], up], [left, down], [left, up], [right, down], [right, up]]
```

In the provided code, the function `get_coordinates` takes a coordinate tuple as an input and returns a list of all the adjacent coordinates. The adjacent coordinates are calculated by shifting the original coordinate tuple in four directions: left, right, up, and down. By adding or subtracting one from the x or y value of the original coordinate, the function creates a new tuple that represents an adjacent coordinate. The function then returns a list of these adjacent coordinates.

The assertion `assert get_coordinates((3, 4)) == [[2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 5], [3, 3], [3, 4], [3, 5], [4, 3], [4, 4], [4, 5]]` checks if the function correctly calculates the adjacent coordinates for the given input `(3, 4)`. The expected output is a list of all the adjacent coordinates, which matches the provided list in the assertion.

To use the function, you can simply call it with a coordinate tuple as an argument. For example, `get_coordinates((3, 4))` will return `[[2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 5], [3, 3], [3, 4], [3, 5], [4, 3], [4, 4], [4, 5]]`.

Overall, the provided function allows you to extract all the adjacent coordinates of a given coordinate tuple.

```python
def get_coordinates(coords):
    left = coords[0] - 1
    right = coords[0] + 1
    up = coords[1] + 1
    down = coords[1] - 1
