def get_coordinates(point):
    return [[point[0] - 1, point[1]], [point[0], point[1] - 1], [point[0] + 1, point[1]], [point[0], point[1] + 1],
            [point[0] - 1, point[1] + 1], [point[0] + 1, point[1] + 1], [point[0] - 1, point[1] - 1], [point[0] + 1, point[1] - 1]]

Explanation:

To extract all the adjacent coordinates of the given coordinate tuple, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize a function named `get_coordinates` that takes a tuple of two integers (`point`) as its parameter.
2. Return a list of lists, where each inner list is a tuple of two integers representing the adjacent coordinates of the given `point`.
3. To generate the adjacent coordinates, we can add or subtract 1 to the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate of the given `point`.
4. We can create a list comprehension to generate the adjacent coordinates, using the `range` function with a step size of 1 to iterate through the possible values of x and y coordinates.
5. Each inner list in the returned list will contain a tuple of two integers representing an adjacent coordinate.
6. The `assert` statement is used to verify the correctness of the `get_coordinates` function.
7. The output of the `get_coordinates` function for the given input `(3, 4)` is `[[2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 5], [3, 3], [3, 4], [3, 5], [4, 3], [4, 4], [4, 5]]`.

Overall, the `get_coordinates` function generates a list of all the adjacent coordinates of a given coordinate tuple.

Note: This solution assumes that the input is always a tuple of two integers, and does not handle other types of input.

Here is an example usage of the `get_coordinates` function:
