def get_coordinates(coordinate):
    x, y = coordinate
    return [[x - 1, y], [x, y - 1], [x + 1, y], [x, y + 1], coordinate]
```

This function takes a coordinate tuple as input and returns a list of all the adjacent coordinates. The input coordinate is unpacked into its x and y components. Then, a list of adjacent coordinates is created using these components. The adjacent coordinates are obtained by incrementing and decrementing the x and y values by one. The original coordinate tuple is also included in the list of adjacent coordinates. The function uses list comprehension to create the list of adjacent coordinates. The function is tested using the assert statement to ensure that it produces the expected result.

```python
assert get_coordinates((3, 4)) == [[2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 5], [3, 3], [3, 4], [3, 5], [4, 3], [4, 4], [4, 5]]
```

This assert statement checks if the function `get_coordinates` returns the expected result when called with the coordinate tuple `(3, 4)`. The expected result is a list of adjacent coordinates, as specified in the assert statement. If the function returns the correct result, the assert statement will pass and no error will be raised.

```
In:
```
```python
get_coordinates((3, 4))
```

```
Out:
```
```
[[2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 5], [3, 3], [3, 4], [3, 5], [4, 3], [4, 4], [4, 5]]
```

The function `get_coordinates` is called with the coordinate tuple `(3, 4)`. The function returns a list of all the adjacent coordinates of the given coordinate. The list is printed as the output. The output shows the adjacent coordinates in the format `[[x - 1, y], [x, y - 1], [x + 1, y], [x, y + 1], coordinate]`.
