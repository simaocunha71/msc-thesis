```
def get_coordinates(coordinate):
    x, y = coordinate
    result = []
    for i in range(x-1, x+2):
        for j in range(y-1, y+2):
            result.append([i, j])
    return result
```

Explanation:
The function `get_coordinates` takes a coordinate tuple as input and extracts all the adjacent coordinates.

To achieve this, the function first unpacks the coordinate tuple into two variables `x` and `y`. 

Then, it initializes an empty list called `result` to store all the adjacent coordinates. 

Next, the function uses nested loops to iterate through all the possible adjacent coordinates. The outer loop iterates over the `x` coordinate, starting from `x-1` and ending at `x+1`. The inner loop iterates over the `y` coordinate, starting from `y-1` and ending at `y+1`. 

For each combination of `x` and `y`, the function appends a new coordinate `[i, j]` to the `result` list. 

Finally, the function returns the `result` list containing all the adjacent coordinates.

In the provided example, the function is called with the coordinate `(3, 4)` and it correctly returns `[[2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 5], [3, 3], [3, 4], [3, 5], [4, 3], [4, 4], [4, 5]]`.

This function can be used to extract all the adjacent coordinates of any given coordinate tuple.

```python
# Testing the function
assert get_coordinates((3, 4)) == [[2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 5], [3, 3], [3, 4], [3, 5], [4, 3], [4, 4], [4, 5]]
```

The assertion checks if the returned result of the `get_coordinates` function with the input `(3, 4)` is equal to the expected output `[[2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 5
