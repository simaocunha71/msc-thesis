To solve this problem, we can follow the below approach:

-   We need to find all the adjacent coordinates of the given coordinate tuple.

-   We can achieve this by checking all the 8 adjacent coordinates of the given coordinate tuple.

-   We can use the below logic to find all the adjacent coordinates:
    -   If the x-coordinate is decreased by 1, we can get the adjacent coordinate to the left of the given coordinate tuple.
    -   If the y-coordinate is decreased by 1, we can get the adjacent coordinate above the given coordinate tuple.
    -   If the x-coordinate is increased by 1, we can get the adjacent coordinate to the right of the given coordinate tuple.
    -   If the y-coordinate is increased by 1, we can get the adjacent coordinate below the given coordinate tuple.
    -   If both the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate are decreased by 1, we can get the adjacent coordinate to the top-left of the given coordinate tuple.
    -   If both the x-coordinate and
