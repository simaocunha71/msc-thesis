"""
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to identify all the numbers in the given string. To do this, we can use a regular expression pattern `r'\d+'` to match one or more consecutive digits.

2. Next, we can use the `re.findall()` function from the `re` module to find all the numbers in the string. This function returns a list of all the matches.

3. After finding all the numbers, we can iterate over each number and remove them from the original string using the `str.replace()` method. We can replace each number with an empty string, effectively removing them from the string.

4. Finally, we can concatenate the original string without the numbers and the list of numbers at the end to get the desired result. We can use the `str.join()` method to concatenate the list of numbers.

Here's an example implementation of the solution:

```python
import re

def move_num(s):
    # Find all the numbers in the string using a regular expression pattern
    nums = re.findall(r'\d+', s)

    # Remove the numbers from the original string
    s = s.replace(*nums)

    # Concatenate the original string without the numbers and the list of numbers at the end
    return s.join(nums)
```

You can test the function with the provided assertion:

```python
assert move_num('I1love143you55three3000thousand') == 'Iloveyouthreethousand1143553000'
```
