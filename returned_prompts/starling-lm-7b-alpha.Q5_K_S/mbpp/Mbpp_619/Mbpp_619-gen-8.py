Here are two possible solutions to the problem:

1. The first solution iterates through the string and checks if each character is a number or not. If it is not a number, it adds it to the beginning of the string, otherwise it adds the number to the end of the string. The function then returns the modified string.

2. The second solution uses the `filter()` function to filter out all the non-alphabetical characters from the string. It then joins the alphabetical characters together and the non-alphabetical characters together using the `join()` function. The function then returns the modified string.

Both solutions should give the same output for the given test case.

The first solution is a simple implementation that uses a for loop to iterate through the string and conditionally concatenate the characters to the modified string. The second solution is a more concise implementation that uses the `filter()` function to filter out the non-alphabetical characters and the `join()` function to concatenate the characters together.

The choice of which solution to use depends on the specific requirements of the problem and the preferences of the programmer.

To use the `move_num()` function, you can simply call it with the desired string as an argument. The function will return the modified string with all the numbers moved to the end of the string.

Here is an example of how to use the function:
```python
print(move_num('I1love14
