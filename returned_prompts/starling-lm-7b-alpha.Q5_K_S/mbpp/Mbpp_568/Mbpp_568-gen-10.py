```
def empty_list(n):
    d = {}
    return [d for i in range(n)]
```

Explanation:

In this problem, we need to create a list of N empty dictionaries. We can achieve this by using a list comprehension. 

Here's how the solution works:

1. We define a function called `empty_list` that takes one parameter, `n`, which represents the number of dictionaries we want to create.
2. Inside the function, we create a single empty dictionary called `d`.
3. We then use a list comprehension to create a list of `n` dictionaries. Each dictionary in the list is a copy of the `d` dictionary we created earlier.
4. Finally, we return the list of dictionaries.

By using a list comprehension, we can generate a list of N empty dictionaries in a concise and efficient manner.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of dictionaries we want to create. The space complexity is also O(n) since we are creating a list with n dictionaries.

It's worth noting that we use `d` as the variable name to avoid conflicts with the built-in `dict` function.

By running the provided test case `assert empty_list(5)==[{},{},{},{},{}]`, we can verify that the `empty_list` function correctly generates a list of 5 empty dictionaries.

Overall, this solution provides a straightforward and efficient way to create a list of N empty dictionaries in Python.

```python
def empty_list(n):
    d = {}
    return [d for i in range(n)]
```

This solution utilizes a list comprehension to create a list of `n` dictionaries, where each dictionary is an empty dictionary. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), and the space complexity is also O(n). 

The assertion `assert empty_list(5)==[{},{},{},{},{}]` confirms that the `empty_list` function correctly generates a list of 5 empty dictionaries. 

In summary, this solution efficiently creates a list of N empty dictionaries using
