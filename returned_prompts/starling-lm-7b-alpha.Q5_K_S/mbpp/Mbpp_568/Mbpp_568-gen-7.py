        res.append({})
    return res
```

This function creates an empty list, then uses a for loop to iterate n times. In each iteration, it adds an empty dictionary to the list. Finally, it returns the list.

This function can create a list of n empty dictionaries, and each dictionary is represented as a set of key-value pairs, where the key is a string and the value is any data type.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the list. This is because it needs to iterate n times to create n empty dictionaries.

The space complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the list. This is because it needs to store n dictionaries in the list.

This function can be used in situations where you need to create a list of empty dictionaries, such as when you need to create multiple objects with the same structure but different data.

For example, if you are designing a system to manage multiple users, and each user has a set of attributes, you can use this function to create a list of empty dictionaries to represent each user's attributes.

In addition, this function can also be used in situations where you need to dynamically add or remove items from the list. For example, if you are designing a shopping cart system, and each cart item is a dictionary that represents the item's attributes, you can use this function to create a list of empty dictionaries to represent each cart item, and then add or remove items from the list as needed.
