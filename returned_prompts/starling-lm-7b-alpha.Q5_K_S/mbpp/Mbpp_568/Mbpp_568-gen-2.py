```
def empty_list(n):
    """
    >>> empty_list(5)
    [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}]
    """
    return [{} for _ in range(n)]
```

The function `empty_list(n)` creates a list of `n` empty dictionaries. It uses a list comprehension to generate the list of dictionaries.

The list comprehension `[{} for _ in range(n)]` iterates `n` times and for each iteration, it creates a new empty dictionary and adds it to the list. The underscore `_` is a common convention in Python to indicate a variable that is not used. In this case, it is used as a placeholder variable in the `range(n)` expression. 

Finally, the function returns the list of empty dictionaries. 

To test the function, the assert statement is used to verify if the output of `empty_list(5)` is equal to the expected result `[{}, {}, {}, {}, {}]`. 

Overall, this function provides a simple and efficient way to create a list of empty dictionaries in Python.

```python
def empty_list(n):
    """
    >>> empty_list(5)
    [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}]
    """
    return [{} for _ in range(n)]
```

To use this function, you can simply call it with the desired number of empty dictionaries you want to create. For example, if you want to create a list of 5 empty dictionaries, you can call the function like this: `empty_list(5)`. This will return a list of 5 empty dictionaries: `[{}, {}, {}, {}, {}]`. 

You can test the function by using the `assert` statement to verify if the output of `empty_list(5)` is equal to the expected result. This ensures that the function is working correctly. 

In summary, the `empty_list(n)` function is a useful tool for creating a list of empty dictionaries in Python, and it can be easily tested and verified using the `assert` statement.
