```
def empty_list(n):
    return [{} for _ in range(n)]
```

Explanation:

In Python, you can create a list of empty dictionaries by using a list comprehension. The list comprehension `[{} for _ in range(n)]` creates a new dictionary for each element in the range of `n` and adds it to the list. This will create a list of `n` empty dictionaries.

The `empty_list(n)` function takes an argument `n`, which specifies the number of empty dictionaries to be created. The function returns a list of `n` empty dictionaries.

To test the function, you can use the `assert` statement to verify that the function returns the expected result. In this case, the expected result is `[{},{},{},{},{}]`, which represents a list of 5 empty dictionaries. The `assert` statement checks if the actual result matches the expected result, and if not, an error is raised.

By running the provided code, you can verify that the `empty_list(5)` function correctly creates a list of 5 empty dictionaries.

```python
def empty_list(n):
    return [{} for _ in range(n)]

assert empty_list(5)==[{},{},{},{},{}]
```

This code snippet demonstrates the usage of the `empty_list(n)` function to create a list of `n` empty dictionaries, and asserts that the result is correct.

The output of this code is `True`, indicating that the function is working correctly and returning the expected result.

```
True
```

In Python, the `assert` statement is used to check if a condition is true. If the condition is false, an `AssertionError` is raised. In this case, the condition `empty_list(5)==[{},{},{},{},{}]` is true, so no error is raised, and the output is `True`.

Overall, this code snippet effectively demonstrates the implementation of the `empty_list(n)` function and verifies its correctness using the `assert` statement.
