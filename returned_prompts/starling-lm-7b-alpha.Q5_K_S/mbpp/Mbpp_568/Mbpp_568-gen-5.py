```
def empty_list(n):
    li = []
    for i in range(n):
        li.append({})
    return li
```

In this function, a list `li` is created. Then, for each number in the range from 0 to `n`, a new empty dictionary is appended to the list.

To verify the function, you can use the following code:
```python
print(empty_list(5)==[{},{},{},{},{}])
```
This should output `True`, confirming that the function is correctly creating a list of N empty dictionaries.

In case you're using Python 3.7 or later, you can use a simpler and faster solution:
```python
def empty_list(n):
    return [{} for _ in range(n)]
```
This code also creates a list of `n` empty dictionaries, but it does so in a more concise and efficient manner.

To verify the function with this version, you can use the following code:
```python
print(empty_list(5)==[{},{},{},{},{}])
```
Again, this should output `True`, confirming that the function is correctly creating a list of N empty dictionaries.

Here are some additional tests for the function:
```python
print(empty_list(3)==[{},{},{}])
print(empty_list(0)==[])
```
These tests should also output `True`, indicating that the function works correctly for different values of `n`.

Lastly, here's a solution that is compatible with Python 2.7:
```python
def empty_list(n):
    return [dict() for _ in range(n)]
```
This code uses the `dict()` constructor to create an empty dictionary, which is compatible with Python 2.7. The rest of the function is the same as the Python 3.7 solution.

To verify the function with this version, you can use the following code:
```python
print(empty_list(5)==[{},{},{},{},{}])
```
This should also output `True`, confirming that the function is correctly creating a list of N empty dictionaries in
