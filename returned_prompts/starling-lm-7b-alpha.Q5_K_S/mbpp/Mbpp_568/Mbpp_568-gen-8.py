```
def empty_list(N):
    return [{} for _ in range(N)]
```

In the above code, we define a function called `empty_list` which takes a parameter `N` that represents the number of empty dictionaries we want to create in the list. 

Inside the function, we use a list comprehension to create a new list. The expression `[{} for _ in range(N)]` iterates `N` times and for each iteration, it creates a new empty dictionary using `{}`. 

Finally, the function returns the list of empty dictionaries. 

To test the function, we can use the `assert` statement to check if the output of `empty_list(5)` is equal to `[{},{},{},{},{}]`. If the assertion is true, it means the function is working correctly.

By using this function, you can easily create a list of N empty dictionaries.

```python
empty_list(5)  # Output: [{},{},{},{},{}]
```

This code will return a list containing 5 empty dictionaries as expected.

```python
def empty_list(N):
    return [{} for _ in range(N)]
```

This function `empty_list(N)` takes a parameter `N` which represents the number of empty dictionaries you want to create in the list. 

Inside the function, a list comprehension `[{} for _ in range(N)]` is used to create a new list. In each iteration of the `range(N)` loop, a new empty dictionary `{}` is created. 

Finally, the function returns the list of empty dictionaries. 

To test the function, you can use the `assert` statement to check if the output of `empty_list(5)` is equal to `[{},{},{},{},{}]`. If the assertion is true, it means the function is working correctly.

By using this function, you can easily create a list of N empty dictionaries.

```python
empty_list(5)  # Output: [{},{},{},{},{}]
