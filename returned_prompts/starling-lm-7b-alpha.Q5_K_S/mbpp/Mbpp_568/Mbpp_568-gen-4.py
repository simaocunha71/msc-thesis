```
def empty_list(N):
    my_list = []
    for i in range(N):
        my_list.append({})
    return my_list
```

In the above code, we define a function called `empty_list` that takes an input parameter `N`. We initialize an empty list called `my_list`. Then, using a for loop, we iterate `N` times. In each iteration, we append an empty dictionary to the list `my_list`. Finally, we return the list `my_list`.

To test the function, you can use the following code:

```python
print(empty_list(5))  # This should print [{},{},{},{},{}]
```

The function `empty_list` creates a list of `N` empty dictionaries and returns it. In the test case, we pass `5` as the input to the function, and it should print `[{},{},{},{},{}]`, which is a list of 5 empty dictionaries.

This solution utilizes a for loop to append an empty dictionary to the list `my_list` for each iteration. By doing so, we can create a list of `N` empty dictionaries.

It's important to note that this solution is not the most efficient way to create a list of `N` empty dictionaries in Python. A more efficient approach would be to use a list comprehension, which is a concise and efficient way to create a new list based on an existing list. Here's an alternative solution using a list comprehension:

```python
def empty_list(N):
    return [{} for _ in range(N)]
```

In this alternative solution, we use a list comprehension to create a new list of `N` empty dictionaries. The syntax `[{} for _ in range(N)]` means "create a new list where each element is an empty dictionary, and repeat this `N` times". This approach is more concise and performs better than using a for loop to append dictionaries to an existing list.

Both solutions achieve the same result, but the alternative solution using a list comprehension is more efficient and concise.

```python
print(empty_list(5))  # This should print [
