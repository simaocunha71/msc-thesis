Explanation:
The function `count_char_position` takes a string `s` as input and returns the number of characters in the string that occur at the same position in the alphabet as their position in the string (case insensitive). 

To solve this problem, we first create a dictionary called `alpha_dict` which maps each lowercase letter of the alphabet to its position index (0-25). We use the formula `chr(i+97)` to convert the index `i` to its corresponding lowercase letter. 

Then, we iterate over each character `c` in the input string `s` after converting it to lowercase. For each character, we check if its position in the alphabet (`alpha_dict[c]`) is equal to its position in the string (`i`). If they are equal, we increment the count `res` by 1. 

Finally, we return the count `res` as the result. 

For example, if we call `count_char_position("xbcefg")`, it will return 2 because the characters 'b' and 'c' occur at the same position in the alphabet as their position in the string.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`. 

To verify the correctness of this function, we can use the provided assertion `assert count_char_position("xbcefg") == 2`. This assertion checks if the function correctly counts the number of characters that occur at the same position in the alphabet as their position in the string. 

If the function is implemented correctly, the assertion will pass and the test will be successful. 

Overall, this solution provides a straightforward and efficient way to count the number of characters in a string that occur at the same position in the alphabet as their position in the string.
