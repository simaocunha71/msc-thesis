# In this code, we define a function noprofit_noloss that takes two arguments, a and b. Inside the function, we check if a is greater than b. If it is, we return True, indicating that there is no profit and no loss. Otherwise, we return False.

# The assert statement is used to check if the function is working correctly. In this case, we are asserting that the function should return False when given the values 1500 and 1200 for a and b, respectively. Since 1500 is greater than 1200, the assertion should pass and the function should return False as expected.
