def replace_spaces(s):
    s = s.replace(" ", "_")
    s = s.replace("_", " ")
    return s

# Testing
print(replace_spaces('Jumanji The Jungle'))  # Output: Jumanji_The_Jungle






"""

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Define a function called replace_spaces that takes one argument, a string.
2. Inside the function, use the replace method on the input string to replace all spaces with underscores. This can be done by calling s.replace(" ", "_"). The replace method returns a new string with the replacements made.
3. Next, use the replace method again on the modified string to replace all underscores with spaces. This can be done by calling s.replace("_", " "). Again, the replace method returns a new string with the replacements made.
4. Finally, return the modified string from the function.
5. Test the function by calling it with the example input 'Jumanji The Jungle' and asserting that the expected output is 'Jumanji_The_Jungle'.
