# Explanation:
# The function replace_spaces takes a string s as input.
# It first replaces all whitespace characters in the string with an underscore using the replace method.
# Then, it replaces all underscore characters in the string with a whitespace character using the replace method again.
# The function then returns the modified string.
# The test_replace_spaces function is used to verify that the replace_spaces function works correctly by asserting that the expected output of 'Jumanji_The_Jungle' is returned when the input 'Jumanji The Jungle' is passed to the function.
