```
def count_list(l):
    cnt = 0
    for i in l:
        if isinstance(i, list):
            cnt += 1
    return cnt
```

Explanation:
This function works by iterating through each element in the list. It then checks if the element is a list using the isinstance function. If it is a list, the counter is incremented by 1. Once all elements have been checked, the function returns the counter which indicates the number of lists.

This solution is efficient because it only requires a single pass through the input list. It also correctly counts nested lists, as each nested list is treated as a separate list.

The assert statement in the question is used to verify that the function correctly counts the number of lists in a specific example input.

As a side note, it's worth mentioning that Python lists can contain elements of different types, including other lists. This is known as nested lists or lists of lists. The function above correctly counts these nested lists, as each one is treated as a separate list.

This function is a simple and effective solution to the problem of counting the number of lists in a given number of lists.

Here's a breakdown of the steps in the function:

1. Initialize a counter variable, cnt, to 0. This will keep track of the number of lists encountered.
2. Iterate through each element, i, in the input list l.
3. Use the isinstance function to check if the current element is a list. This function returns True if the object is of the specified type; otherwise, it returns False.
4. If the current element is a list, increment the counter cnt by 1.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each element in the list.
6. After iterating through all elements, return the final value of the counter cnt, which represents the number of lists in the input list.

The assert statement at the beginning of the question is a way to check if the function is working correctly. It ensures that the function correctly counts the number of lists in a specific example input, which is [[1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]].

The function uses a single pass through the input list to count the number of lists.
