#Explanation
#The function count_list takes one argument, my_list, which is a list of lists. It initializes the result variable to 0. Then, it traverses through the my_list using a for loop. For each element in the list, it checks if the element is a list using the isinstance function. If the element is a list, it increments the result by one. Finally, it returns the result. The driver code creates a list of lists and calls the function count_list to count the number of lists in the given list. The result is printed using the print statement.

#Complexity Analysis
#Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list. This is because the function count_list traverses through the list only once.
#Space complexity: O(1), as the function count_list does not use any additional data structure to store the result.

#Test Case
#The test case assert count_list([[1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]) == 4 checks if the function count_list correctly counts the number of lists in the given list [1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]. The expected result is 4, as there are four lists in the input list.

#Additional Notes
#The function count_list can be used to count the number of lists in any given list of lists, not just the specific example provided in the test case. For example, you can call the
