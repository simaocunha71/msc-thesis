Explanation:
The function reverse_string_list takes a list of strings as an argument and returns a new list in which each string is reversed.
The function uses a list comprehension to create a new list of strings in which each string is the reversed version of the corresponding string in the original list.
The assertion tests if the function correctly reverses the strings in the given list.
The assertion compares the result of the function with the expected output for the given test case. If the result matches the expected output, the assertion passes and the function is correct. Otherwise, the assertion fails and an error message is raised.
"""
# End of Explanation
"""
To use the function, you can call it with a list of strings as an argument, like this:
reverse_string_list(['Red', 'Green', 'Blue', 'White', 'Black'])
This will return a new list in which each string is reversed: ['deR', 'neerG', 'eulB', 'etihW', 'kcalB']
You can then compare the result with the expected output to verify if the function works correctly:
assert reverse_string_list(['Red', 'Green', 'Blue', 'White', 'Black'])==['deR', 'neerG', 'eulB', 'etihW', 'kcalB']
If the assertion passes, it means that the function correctly reverses each string in the given list.
