Here's one way you might approach this problem:

The "woodall number" is defined as a number that can be rearranged to produce a palindrome.  For example, 1331 can be rearranged to produce 1331, which is a palindrome.  However, 123 is a non-woodall number because, when you rearrange the digits, you cannot produce a palindrome.  The function is_woodall(n) should return True if the given number n is a woodall number, and False otherwise.  Here's a possible implementation:

```python
def is_woodall(n):
    # Convert the number to a string, then rearrange its digits
    digits = map(int, list(str(n)))
    digits.sort()
    # Reverse the digits and convert them back to an integer
    n = int(''.join(map(str, digits)))
    # Check if the rearranged number is a palindrome
    return str(n) == ''.join(map(str, reversed(list(str(n)))))
```

You can use the assert statement to verify that this function is correct:

```python
assert is_woodall(383) == True
```

However, note that this function is not very efficient, as it sorts the digits and then converts them back to an integer.  A more efficient function would use a different approach, such as converting the number to a string, reversing the string, and comparing it to the original string.

Here's a more efficient version of the function:

```python
def is_woodall(n):
    # Convert the number to a string, then reverse its digits
    digits = map(int, list(str(n)))
    digits.reverse()
    # Convert the digits back to an integer and check if the rearranged number is a palindrome
    return str(n) == ''.join(map(str, digits))
```

Again, you can use the assert statement to verify that this function is correct:

```python
assert is_woodall(383) == True
