Explanation:
The function is_woodall takes a number as an argument and checks if the number is a woodall number or not. It does so by converting the number to a string and then checking if each character in the string is the same as its reverse. If any character is not the same as its reverse, the function returns False, indicating that the number is not a woodall number. If all characters are the same as their reverse, the function returns True, indicating that the number is a woodall number.

For example, when the function is called with the number 383, it will convert the number to the string '383'. Then, it will check if each character in the string is the same as its reverse. Since '3' is the same as its reverse '3' and '8' is the same as its reverse '8', the function will return True, indicating that 383 is a woodall number.

Note that the function uses the slicing notation arr[::-1] to reverse the string. The '::-1' syntax means to start at the end of the string and end at position 0, moving with a step of -1 (i.e., moving backwards).

Overall, the function is_woodall provides a straightforward way to determine if a given number is a woodall number or not.
