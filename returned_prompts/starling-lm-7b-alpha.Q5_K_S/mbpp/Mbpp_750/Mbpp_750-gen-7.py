def add_tuple(lst, tup):

# assert add_tuple([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) == [5, 6, 7, 9, 10]


# Here is another solution using extend method

    lst.extend(tup)
    return lst


# assert add_tuple([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) == [5, 6, 7, 9, 10]


# Here is another solution using insert method

Here are some tips for solving this problem:

1. To add a tuple to a list, you can use the `append()` method or the `extend()` method. The `append()` method adds the tuple as a single element to the end of the list, while the `extend()` method adds each element of the tuple as a separate element to the end of the list.

2. To add a tuple to a list at a specific position, you can use the `insert()` method. The `insert()` method inserts the tuple at the specified index position in the list.

3. After adding the tuple to the list, you can return the modified list as the result of the function.

4. You can use the `assert` statement to check if the function is working correctly by comparing the expected output with the actual output.

5. Make sure to test your function with different inputs to ensure that it works correctly in all cases.
