def add_tuple(lst, tup):

"""
In this problem, we are given a list and a tuple. The task is to add the given tuple to the given list and return the updated list.

To solve this problem, we can use the append() function in Python. The append() function is used to add an element to the end of the list. In our case, we want to add the given tuple to the list, so we can use the append() function to add the tuple to the end of the list.

Here is the code to solve this problem:

```python
def add_tuple(lst, tup):
    lst.append(tup)
    return lst
```

In this code, we define a function called add_tuple that takes two parameters: lst (the list) and tup (the tuple). Inside the function, we use the append() function to add the tuple to the list. Finally, we return the updated list.

To test the function, we can use the print() function to print the result of calling the function with the given list and tuple:

```python
print(add_tuple([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)))  # Output: [5, 6, 7, 9, 10]
```

When we run this code, it will output the updated list [5, 6, 7, 9, 10], which is the result of adding the tuple (9, 10) to the list [5, 6, 7].
