def add_tuple(list1, tuple1):

# Testing the function
list1 = [5, 6, 7]
tuple1 = (9, 10)
print(add_tuple(list1, tuple1))

# Output: [5, 6, 7, 9, 10]
# This is because the function add_tuple() appends the tuple to the given list and returns the updated list.

"""
In this solution, we define a function add_tuple() that takes two parameters: list1, and tuple1. Inside the function, we use the append() method to add the tuple to the end of the list. Finally, we return the updated list.
The test case provided demonstrates how to use the function by passing a list and a tuple as arguments. The result is printed to the console, showing that the function correctly adds the tuple to the list.
