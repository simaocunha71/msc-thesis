"""
Here is a step-by-step guide to solve this problem:

1. We have a list of tuples, and we want to find the maximum product of the pairs within the tuples.
2. We can start by initializing a variable max_product to 0, which will store the maximum product we find.
3. Then, we can iterate through the list of tuples using the range function and the len function. We use the range function to create a sequence of numbers from 0 to the length of the list minus one.
4. Inside the loop, we can calculate the product of the two numbers within the tuple using the multiply operator. We can assign this product to a variable called product.
5. Next, we can update the max_product variable by comparing it to the product variable. We can use the max function to find the maximum value between the two.
6. After iterating through all the tuples, we can return the max_product variable as the result.
7. In the assert statement, we can test the function with a sample list of tuples and the expected result.

        max_product = max(max_product, product)
    return max_product

# Test the function

# Test with an empty list of tuples
assert max_product_tuple([]) == 0

# Test with a list of tuples with only one tuple
assert max_product_tuple([(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), (7, 8)]) == 2

# Test with a list of tuples with only one number
assert max_product_tuple([(1), (2), (3), (4)]) == 1
