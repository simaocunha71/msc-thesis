Here's how to do it:

1. Iterate through each tuple in the list.
2. For each tuple, calculate the maximum product of the two elements in the tuple. This can be done by multiplying the two numbers together and taking the maximum of the result.
3. Compare the product of each tuple to the maximum product found so far. If the product of the current tuple is greater than the maximum product found so far, update the maximum product with the product of the current tuple.
4. After iterating through all of the tuples, return the maximum product found.

Here's the Python code that implements this algorithm:

def max_product_tuple(tuples):
    max_product = 0
    for t in tuples:
        product = max(t[0] * t[1], -1 * t[0] * t[1])
        if product > max_product:
            max_product = product
    return max_product

def max_product_tuple(tuples):
    max_product = 0
    for t in tuples:
        product = max(fabs(t[0]*t[1]),fabs(-1*t[0]*t[1]))
        if product > max_product:
            max_product = product
    return max_product

    assert(max_product_tuple([(2, 7), (2, 6), (1, 8), (4, 9)]) == 36)
    assert(max_product_tuple([(3, 4), (5, 6), (7, 8), (9, 10)]) == 720)
    print("All tests passed.")
