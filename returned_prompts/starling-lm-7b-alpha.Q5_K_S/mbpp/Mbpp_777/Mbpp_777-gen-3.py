"""
This function works by first creating a set from the given list. A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. The set_lst variable will only contain unique elements from the list. Next, a variable called sum is initialized to zero. The function then iterates through the set and adds each element to the sum variable. Finally, the function returns the sum of all the unique elements in the list.
"""

"""
The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. This is because the function iterates through the set, which has the same number of elements as the list.

The space complexity of this function is O(n). This is because the set can have up to n elements, where n is the number of elements in the list.

"""
This function can be used to find the sum of non-repeated elements in any given list. It can be easily modified to work with different data types, such as strings or dictionaries, by changing the type of elements in the set_lst variable.
"""

"""
This function can also be used to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a list of different data types. For example, if the list contains both integers and strings, the function will still work correctly and return the sum of the non-repeated elements.
"""

"""
This function can also be used to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a nested list. For example, if the list contains other lists, the function will still work correctly and return the sum of the non-repeated elements in all the nested lists.

"""
This function can also be used to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a list that is generated dynamically. For example, if the list is generated using a loop or a function, the function will still work correctly and return the sum
