# Here's a Python function that calculates the sum of even numbers at even positions of a list:

```python
def sum_even_and_even_index(lst):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(0, len(lst), 2):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            sum += lst[i]
    return sum
```

To use this function, you can pass your list as an argument, for example:

```python
lst = [5, 6, 12, 1, 18, 8]
print(sum_even_and_even_index(lst))
```

The function `sum_even_and_even_index` takes a list as input and initializes a variable `sum` to keep track of the sum. It then iterates over the list using a step of 2 (to only consider even indices) and checks if the value at the current index is even (i.e., divisible by 2). If it is, the value is added to the sum. Finally, the function returns the sum of the even numbers at even positions of the list.

In the example provided, the function is called with the list `[5, 6, 12, 1, 18, 8]` and the sum of the even numbers at even positions (which are 6, 12, and 8) is printed, resulting in the output `30`.

You can modify the `lst` variable to test the function with different lists.

Here's a sample run of the function with the provided list:
```
$ python3 test_sum_even_and_even_index.py
30
```

The `sum_even
