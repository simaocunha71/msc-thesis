# Here's a Python function that removes all whitespaces from a given string:

```python
def remove_all_spaces(input_str):
    return input_str.replace(' ', '')
```

To test this function with the given input, you can simply call the function with the string `'python  program'`:

```python
remove_all_spaces('python  program')
```

This will return the string `'pythonprogram'` as expected.

The function works by using the `replace()` method of strings in Python. This method takes two arguments: the substring to be replaced (in this case, a single space), and the substring to replace it with (in this case, an empty string, which effectively removes the space).

The `replace()` method is called on the `input_str` variable, and the result is returned by the function.

By using this function, you can easily remove all whitespaces from any given string in Python.
