```python
def remove_all_spaces(s):
    return s.replace(" ","")
```

Explanation:
In the above function, we define a function called "remove_all_spaces" which takes a string 's' as an input. The function uses the "replace" method to remove all whitespaces from the string 's'. The "replace" method replaces all occurrences of a specified value with another value. In this case, we are replacing all whitespaces with an empty string, effectively removing them from the string. The modified string is then returned as the output of the function. 

To test the function, we use the "print" statement to print the result of calling the function with the input string 'python  program'. The output of this test case should be 'pythonprogram', which is the modified string with all whitespaces removed.
```

```python
# Test
print(remove_all_spaces('python  program')) # 'pythonprogram'
```

Explanation:
In the above code, we call the function "remove_all_spaces" with the input string 'python  program' and print the result. The output of this test case is 'pythonprogram', which is the modified string with all whitespaces removed. 

This test case demonstrates that the function is correctly removing all whitespaces from the input string and returning the modified string as the output.
