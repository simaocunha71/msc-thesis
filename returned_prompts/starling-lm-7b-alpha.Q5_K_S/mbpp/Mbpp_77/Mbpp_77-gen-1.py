To determine whether a number is divisible by 11, you can use the following logic:

```python
def is_Diff(num):
    if (num % 11 == 0):
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

To validate the function, you can use the following test cases:

```python
assert is_Diff(12345) == False
```

In this case, the number 12345 is not divisible by 11, so the function returns False.

Note: The logic can be modified to return True or False based on whether the number is divisible by 11 or not.

```python
def is_Diff(num):
    if (num % 11 == 0):
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

You can use this function to check the divisibility of any number by 11.

```python
print(is_Diff(12345))  # Output: False
```
