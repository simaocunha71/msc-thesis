Here's a Python function that checks whether a number is divisible by 11:

```python
def is_Divisible_11(num):
    if (num % 11 == 0):
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

To test this function, you can use the `assert` statement. For example, to check if 12345 is not divisible by 11, you can do the following:

```python
assert is_Divisible_11(12345) == False
```

The `assert` statement checks if the condition (`is_Divisible_11(12345) == False`) is true. If the condition is true, the program will continue running; if it's false, an error will be raised and the program will stop. In this case, since the condition is false, no error will be raised and the program will continue running.

Here's a sample Python code that demonstrates how to use the `assert` statement to test the `is_Divisible_11` function:

```python
def is_Divisible_11(num):
    if (num % 11 == 0):
        return True
    else:
        return False

assert is_Divisible_11(12345) == False
print("Test passed")
```

When you run this code, you'll see the message "Test passed" printed to the console, indicating that the assertion passed and the program is working correctly.

```python
def is_Divisible_11(num):
    if (num % 11 == 0):
        return True
    else:
        return False

assert is_Divisible_11(12345) == False
print("Test passed")
```
