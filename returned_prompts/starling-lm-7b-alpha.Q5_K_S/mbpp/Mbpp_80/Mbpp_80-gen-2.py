def tetrahedral_number(n):
    return n*(n+1)**2//2
```

Explanation:

A tetrahedral number is a number that is equal to the sum of the first n natural numbers. The nth tetrahedral number can be calculated using the formula n*(n+1)**2//2.

In the provided function, the input n represents the position of the tetrahedral number in the sequence. The function then calculates and returns the nth tetrahedral number using the formula.

To verify the correctness of the function, an assertion is used to check if the function returns the correct value for the example input of 5. This ensures that the function is correctly calculating the tetrahedral numbers.

Overall, the function provides an efficient way to find the nth tetrahedral number in Python.

```
def tetrahedral_number(n):
    return n*(n+1)**2//2
```

This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the `n`th tetrahedral number. The tetrahedral number is calculated using the formula `n*(n+1)**2//2`. 

To verify the correctness of the function, an assertion is used to check if the function returns the correct value for the example input of `5`. This ensures that the function is correctly calculating the tetrahedral numbers. 

Overall, the function provides an efficient way to find the `n`th tetrahedral number in Python.
