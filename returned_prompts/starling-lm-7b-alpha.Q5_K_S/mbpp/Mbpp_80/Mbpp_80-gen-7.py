"""
In a tetrahedron, the sum of the first n natural numbers is called the nth tetrahedral number. The first few tetrahedral numbers are 1, 4, 10, 20, 35, 56, 84, 120, 165, 220, ...

The nth tetrahedral number can be computed by the formula:

n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6

Alternatively, we can use the formula:

n * (n + 1) // 2 + 1
