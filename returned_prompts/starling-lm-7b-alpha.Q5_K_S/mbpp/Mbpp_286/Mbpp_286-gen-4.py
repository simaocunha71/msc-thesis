Here's a step-by-step guide on how to solve this problem:

1. Understand the problem:
The problem asks us to find the maximum sum of a contiguous array in the modified array. The modified array is formed by repeating the given array k times. 

2. Approach:
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

- Create a function, `max_sub_array_sum_repeated`, that takes in three parameters: `arr` (the original array), `k` (the number of times the array is repeated), and `n` (the length of the modified array).

- If `k` is 0, the modified array will be empty, so we should return 0.

- If `k` is 1, the modified array will be the same as the original array, so we should return the maximum sum of the contiguous subarray in the original array.

- For any other value of `k`, we can find the maximum sum of the contiguous subarray in the modified array by finding the maximum sum of the contiguous subarray in the first `n` elements of the modified array and then adding the maximum sum of the contiguous subarray in the next `n` elements of the modified array. This is because the maximum sum of the contiguous subarray in the modified array will be the maximum sum of the contiguous subarray in the first `n` elements plus the maximum sum of the contiguous subarray in the next `n` elements, and so on.

- To find the maximum sum of the contiguous subarray in the first `n` elements of the modified array, we can use the `max_sub_array_sum` function from the previous problem. This function takes in two parameters: `arr` (the array) and `n` (the length of the array). It returns the maximum sum of the contiguous subarray in the first `n` elements of the array.

- To find the maximum sum of the contiguous subarray in the next `n` elements of the modified array, we can use the same `max_sub_array_sum` function. However, we need to pass the `arr` parameter as `arr[n:]` to get the elements starting from the `n`th element.
