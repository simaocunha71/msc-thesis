Here's a Python function that solves this problem:

```python
def max_sub_array_sum_repeated(nums, k, t):
    if t == 1:
        return max(nums)
    elif t == 2:
        return max(nums[0] + nums[-1], nums[1])
    elif k % 2 == 0:
        return max(sum(nums[:k//2]) + sum(nums[len(nums)-k//2:]), sum(nums))
    else:
        return max(sum(nums[:k//2 + 1]) + sum(nums[len(nums)-k//2:]), sum(nums))
```

Explanation:
The function `max_sub_array_sum_repeated` takes three arguments: `nums`, `k`, and `t`. `nums` is the input array, `k` is the number of times the array is repeated, and `t` is the target number of times the array is repeated. The function returns the largest sum of a contiguous array in the modified array.

If `t` is equal to 1, the function simply returns the maximum value in the array. If `t` is equal to 2, the function returns the maximum sum of the first and last elements in the array.

If `k` is even, the function finds the maximum sum of the first `k//2` elements and the last `k//2` elements in the array, and the maximum sum of the entire array. It returns the maximum of these two sums.

If `k` is odd, the function finds the maximum sum of the first `k//2 + 1` elements and the last `k//2` elements in the array, and the maximum sum of the entire array. It returns the maximum of these three sums.

The function uses the `sum` function to calculate the sum of elements in a list.
