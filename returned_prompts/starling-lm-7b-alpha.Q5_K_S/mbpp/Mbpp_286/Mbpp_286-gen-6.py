To find the largest sum of a contiguous array, you can use the Kadane's algorithm. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. Initialize a variable `max_sum` to store the maximum sum encountered so far. Set it to the first element of the array.
2. Initialize a variable `current_sum` to store the current sum of the contiguous subarray. Set it to the first element of the array.
3. Iterate through the remaining elements of the array using a loop:
   - If the current element is greater than the sum of the previous element and the current element, update `current_sum` to the current element.
   - If the current element is less than the sum of the previous element and the current element, update `max_sum` to the maximum value between `current_sum` and `max_sum`.
   - If the current element is greater than `max_sum`, update `max_sum` to the current element.
4. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for all elements in the array.
5. The final value of `max_sum` is the maximum sum of a contiguous array in the original array.

To find the largest sum of a contiguous array in the modified array which is formed by repeating the given array `k` times, you can follow these steps:

1. Initialize a variable `max_sum` to store the maximum sum encountered so far. Set it to the first element of the array.
2. Initialize a variable `current_sum` to store the current sum of the contiguous subarray. Set it to the first element of the array.
3. Iterate through the remaining elements of the array using a loop:
   - If the current element is greater than the sum of the previous element and the current element, update `current_sum` to the current element.
   - If the current element is less than the sum of the previous element and the current element, update `max_sum` to the maximum value between `current_sum` and `max_sum`.
   - If the current element is greater than `max_sum`, update `max_sum` to the current element.
4. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for all elements in the array.
5. The final value of `max_sum
