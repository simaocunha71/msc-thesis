Here is a possible solution:

```python
def max_sub_array_sum_repeated(nums, k, max_len):
    max_sum = 0
    for _ in range(k):
        max_sum += max(0, max(nums))
        nums = [x for x in nums if x > 0]
        if len(nums) > max_len:
            nums = nums[:max_len]
    return max_sum
```

This function works by repeating the array k times and then iteratively updating the sum of the subarray with the largest sum. This is done by taking the maximum of 0 and the maximum value in the array, then removing all values that are not positive and keeping only the last max_len values. The sum of the subarray is then added to the maximum sum. This process is repeated k times to get the final maximum sum of the contiguous array in the modified array.

        if (curr_sum > max_sum):
            max_sum = curr_sum
