To solve this problem, we can follow the steps below:

1. First, we need to find the largest sum of a contiguous array in the original array. This can be done using the Kadane's algorithm, which finds the maximum sum contiguous subarray of a given one-dimensional array. Here is an example implementation of the algorithm:

def max_sub_array_sum(nums):
    max_so_far = float('-inf')
    max_ending_here = 0
    for num in nums:
        max_ending_here = max(0, max_ending_here + num)
        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)
    return max_so_far

2. Once we have the maximum sum of the original array, we need to find the maximum sum of a contiguous array in the modified array, which is formed by repeating the given array k times. To do this, we can simply multiply the maximum sum of the original array by k. This is because the maximum sum of a contiguous array in the modified array is the same as the maximum sum of a contiguous array in the original array, and repeating the array k times does not change the maximum sum. Here is an example implementation of this step:

def max_sub_array_sum_repeated(nums, k):
    max_sum = max_sub_array_sum(nums)
    return max_sum * k

3. Finally, we can combine the above steps to solve the problem. Here is an example implementation of the complete solution:

def max_sub_array_sum_repeated(nums, k):
    max_sum = max_sub_array_sum(nums)
    return max_sum * k

To test the solution, you can use the assert statement to check if it returns the correct result for the given example input:

assert max_sub_array_sum_repeated([10, 20, -30, -1], 4, 3) == 30
