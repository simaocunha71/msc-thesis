To toggle the case of all characters in a string, you can use the `swapcase()` method in Python. This method returns a copy of the original string with all uppercase characters converted to lowercase and all lowercase characters converted to uppercase.

Here is an example of how you can use the `swapcase()` method to solve the problem:

```python
def toggle_string(s):
    return s.swapcase()
```

You can test the function with the provided assert statement to ensure it correctly toggles the case of the characters in the string:

```python
assert toggle_string("Python") == "pYTHON"
```

The `toggle_string` function takes a string `s` as input and uses the `swapcase()` method to return a new string with toggled case. The assert statement checks if the function correctly toggles the case of the characters in the string "Python" and compares the result with the expected output "pYTHON". If the two strings are not equal, an AssertionError will be raised.

Using the `swapcase()` method is a straightforward and efficient way to toggle the case of all characters in a string in Python.

# Python Program to Toggle the Case of All Characters in a String
def toggle_string(s):
    return s.swapcase()

# Test the function
assert toggle_string("Python") == "pYTHON"
```

This solution utilizes Python's built-in `swapcase()` method, which converts all uppercase characters to lowercase and all lowercase characters to uppercase, effectively toggling the case of all characters in the string.

The `toggle_string` function takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string with toggled case using the `swapcase()` method. The provided assert statement checks if the function correctly toggles the case of the characters in the string "Python" and compares the result with the expected output "pYTHON". If the two strings are not equal, an AssertionError will be raised.

Using the `swapcase()` method is a simple and efficient way to toggle the case of all characters in a string in Python, ensuring consistent and correct results.
