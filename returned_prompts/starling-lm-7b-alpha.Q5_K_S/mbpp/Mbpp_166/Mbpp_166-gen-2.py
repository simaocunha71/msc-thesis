```
def find_even_pair(nums):
    result = 0
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
            if (nums[i] ^ nums[j]) % 2 == 0:
                result += 1
    return result
```

In this solution, we define a function called `find_even_pair` that takes in a list of integers called `nums`. We initialize a variable called `result` to keep track of the number of even pairs. 

We then use two nested loops to iterate through all pairs of integers in the `nums` list. The outer loop iterates from the first element to the second-to-last element, and the inner loop iterates from the element after the outer loop's current element to the last element. 

For each pair of integers, we calculate the XOR (exclusive OR) of the two numbers using the `^` operator. If the result is an even number (i.e., the remainder of the division by 2 is 0), we increment the `result` variable by 1. 

Finally, we return the `result` variable, which represents the total count of pairs of integers in the `nums` list that XOR to an even number.

To verify the correctness of the solution, we can use the `assert` statement to check if the `find_even_pair` function returns the expected result for a sample input `[5, 4, 7, 2, 1]`, which should be 4.

Overall, this solution effectively counts the number of pairs of integers in a list that XOR to an even number by iterating through all possible pairs and checking if the XOR result is even.
