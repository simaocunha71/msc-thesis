```
def is_upper(string):
    return string.upper()
```

Explanation:

The `upper()` function in Python is a built-in method for string objects. It returns a string in uppercase.

In the provided solution, the function `is_upper` takes a string as an argument and uses the `upper()` method to convert the string to uppercase. The function then returns the uppercase version of the string.

The assert statement at the end of the solution is used to verify the correctness of the function. It checks if the returned value of `is_upper("person")` is equal to `"PERSON"`. Since the `upper()` method converts the string to uppercase, the assertion should pass and return True.

Overall, the solution provides a Python function that converts a given string to uppercase using the `upper()` method.

```python
def is_upper(string):
    return string.upper()
```

This function takes a string as an argument and returns the uppercase version of the string using the `upper()` method. The `upper()` method is a built-in method in Python for string objects, which converts the string to uppercase.

To test the function, an assert statement is used to verify if the returned value of `is_upper("person")` is equal to `"PERSON"`. Since the `upper()` method converts the string to uppercase, the assertion should pass and return True, indicating that the function is working correctly.

In summary, the provided solution demonstrates a Python function that converts a given string to uppercase using the `upper()` method, along with a test case to verify its correctness.
