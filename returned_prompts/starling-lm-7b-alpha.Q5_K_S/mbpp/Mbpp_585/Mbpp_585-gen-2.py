Here's a function that finds the n most expensive items in a given dataset:

```python
def expensive_items(items, n):
    """
    Finds the n most expensive items in a given dataset.

    Args:
        items (list): A list of dictionaries containing the name and price of items.
        n (int): The number of most expensive items to return.

    Returns:
        list: A list of dictionaries containing the names and prices of the most expensive items.
    """
    items.sort(key=lambda x: x['price'], reverse=True)
    return items[:n]
```

To use this function, you can call it with a list of dictionaries as the `items` parameter and the desired number of most expensive items as the `n` parameter. The function will sort the items based on their price in descending order and return a list of the top `n` items.

For example, to find the 1 most expensive item in the dataset `[{'name': 'Item-1', 'price': 101.1},{'name': 'Item-2', 'price': 555.22}]`, you can call the function like this:

```python
print(expensive_items([{'name': 'Item-1', 'price': 101.1},{'name': 'Item-2', 'price': 555.22}], 1))
```

The output will be `[{'name': 'Item-2', 'price': 555.22}]`, which is a list containing the name and price of the most expensive item in the dataset.

```python
def expensive_items(items, n):
    """
    Finds the n most expensive items in a given dataset.

    Args:
        items (list): A list of dictionaries containing the name and price of items.
        n (int): The number of most expensive items to return.

    Returns:
        list: A list of dictionaries containing the names and prices of the most expensive items.
    """
    items.sort(key=lambda x: x['price'], reverse=True)
    return items[:n]
```
