def list_tuple(input_list):
    return tuple(input_list)
```

Explanation:
The function list_tuple takes one argument, input_list, which is a list of numbers. It uses the built-in tuple function to convert the list to a tuple, and returns the result. The assert statement checks that the function returns the correct result for the given input list.

In Python, the tuple function is used to convert an iterable (such as a list) to a tuple. This is done by passing the iterable as an argument to the function, and the function returns a tuple with the same elements as the input iterable. In this case, the function list_tuple takes a list as an argument and uses the tuple function to convert the list to a tuple. The result is then returned by the function.

The assert statement is used to check if the function returns the correct result for a given input list. In this case, the assert statement checks if the result of calling the function with the input list [5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3] is equal to the tuple (5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3). If the two values are not equal, an AssertionError will be raised, indicating that the function is not working correctly.

Overall, the function list_tuple takes a list as an argument and uses the tuple function to convert the list to a tuple. The function returns the tuple, and the assert statement checks if the function is working correctly by comparing the result with a known correct result.

```python
# Testing the function
print(list_tuple([5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3]))  # Should print (5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3)
```

This code tests the function list_tuple by calling it with the input list [5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3]. The result is printed to the console, and should be the tuple (5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3).

The function works by using the built-in tuple function to convert a list to a tuple. This function is called with
