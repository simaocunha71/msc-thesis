"""
In this code, we define a function called `list_tuple` that takes a list as an argument and returns a tuple with the same elements as the input list.

To convert a list to a tuple, we use the built-in `tuple()` function in Python. This function takes an iterable as an argument (in this case, the input list) and returns a tuple with the same elements.

We then test the function by passing a list `[5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3]` to the `list_tuple` function and asserting that the returned value is equal to the tuple `(5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3)`. This ensures that the function is working correctly.
