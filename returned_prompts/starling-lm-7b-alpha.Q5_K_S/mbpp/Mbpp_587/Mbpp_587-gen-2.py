This function, list_tuple, takes a list as input and returns a tuple with the same elements as the list. The function uses the built-in tuple function, which transforms an iterable object into a tuple.

"""
In Python, the tuple() function is used to convert an iterable object into a tuple. The iterable object can be a list, string, dictionary, etc.

In the function list_tuple(lst), the input parameter lst represents the list to be converted. The function uses the tuple() function to convert the list into a tuple, and then returns the resulting tuple.

The assert statement is used to check if the function returns the expected result. In this case, the function is expected to return the tuple (5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3) when given the list [5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3] as input. If the function does not return the expected result, the assert statement will raise an AssertionError.
