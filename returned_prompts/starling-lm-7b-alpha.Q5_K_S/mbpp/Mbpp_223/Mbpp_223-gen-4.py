def is_majority(arr, n, elem):

    while left < right:
        if arr[left] == elem:
            left += 1
        elif arr[right] == elem:
            right -= 1
        elif elem > arr[left] and elem < arr[right]:
            break
        elif elem >= arr[left] and elem <= arr[right]:

Explanation:

The given problem can be solved using the two pointers approach. We can define two pointers, left and right, initialized to 0 and n-1 respectively. We can iterate through the array while left is less than right. Inside the loop, we check if the element at the left pointer is equal to the target element. If it is, we increment the left pointer. Similarly, if the element at the right pointer is equal to the target element, we decrement the right pointer. If the target element is greater than the element at the left pointer and less than the element at the right pointer, we break the loop as the target element cannot be a majority element. If the target element is greater than or equal to the element at the left pointer and less than or equal to the element at the right pointer, we update the left pointer to the right pointer. If the target element is less than the element at the left pointer or greater than the element at the right pointer, we update the right pointer to the left pointer. Finally, we check if the right pointer is equal to n-1, which means the target element is a majority element, and return True. Otherwise, we return False.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) as we iterate through the array once using the two pointers approach. The space complexity is O(1) as we only use a constant amount of extra space to store the left and right pointers.

Overall, this solution efficiently solves the problem of checking if a given element is the majority element in a sorted array using the two pointers approach.

Here are some additional test cases for the solution:
