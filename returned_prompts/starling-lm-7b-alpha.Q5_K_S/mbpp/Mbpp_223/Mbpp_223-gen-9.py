```
def is_majority(arr, n, e):
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if arr[i] == e:
            i += 1
        else:
            return False
    return True
```

Here's an explanation of the solution:

The function `is_majority` takes in three parameters:

- `arr`: the sorted array
- `n`: the length of the array
- `e`: the element to check if it's the majority element

The function initializes a pointer `i` to the first element of the array. It then enters a while loop that continues until `i` reaches the end of the array.

Inside the while loop, the function checks if the element at index `i` is equal to the element `e`. If it is, the pointer `i` is incremented by 1. If it's not, it means that `e` is not the majority element, so the function returns False.

Once the while loop is finished, it means that the pointer `i` has traversed the entire array and found that all occurrences of `e` are consecutive. Therefore, `e` is the majority element, and the function returns True.

The provided assert statement is an example of how the function can be used. It checks if `is_majority` correctly identifies the element 3 as the majority element in the given sorted array [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 10] of length 7.

The time complexity of the `is_majority` function is O(n) because it iterates through the array once.

The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a single pointer `i`.

Overall, the function efficiently determines if a given element is the majority element in a sorted array.

Here are some test cases to verify the correctness of the `is_majority` function:

```python
assert is_majority([1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 10], 7, 3) == True
assert is_majority([1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5], 7
