"""
The above function uses list comprehension to return a list of all negative numbers in the input list.
"""

"""
To make sure that the function works correctly, we can write a test using assert to compare the result of the function with the expected result.
"""



"""
The function can be tested by calling it with a sample input and checking if the result matches the expected result.
If the result matches the expected result, the assert statement will not raise an exception and the test will pass.
