"""
The volume of a cone is given by the formula V = (1/3)πr²h, where r is the radius of the circular base and h is the height of the cone. To solve this problem, you can create a function named volume_cone that takes the radius and the height as inputs. Then, you can calculate and return the volume of the cone using the given formula. Here is a possible solution:

"""
import math

def volume_cone(r, h):
    return (1/3) * math.pi * r ** 2 * h

# Test the function
r = 5
h = 12
assert math.isclose(volume_cone(r, h), 314.15926535897927, rel_tol=0.001)

"""
In this solution, we first import the math module to use the mathematical constant pi. Then, we define the function volume_cone that takes two parameters: r and h, representing the radius and the height of the cone, respectively. Inside the function, we calculate and return the volume of the cone using the formula V = (1/3)πr²h. Finally, we test the function by providing the radius and the height, and assert that the result is approximately equal to the expected value, with a relative tolerance of 0.001.

# Explanation
"""
The purpose of this code is to calculate the volume of a cone based on the radius and the height. To do this, we define a function named volume_cone that takes two parameters: r (the radius of the circular base) and h (the height of the cone). Inside the function, we use the formula V = (1/3)πr²h to calculate the volume of the cone. We then test the function by providing the radius and the height, and assert that the result is approximately equal to the expected value, with a relative tolerance of 0.001. This ensures that the function is working correctly.
"""

# Conclusion
"""
In conclusion, the provided code defines a function named volume_cone that calculates the volume of a cone based on the radius and the height. The function uses the formula V = (1/3)πr²h to perform the calculation.
