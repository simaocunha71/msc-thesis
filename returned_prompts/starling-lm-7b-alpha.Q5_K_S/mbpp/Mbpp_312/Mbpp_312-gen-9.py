"""

To find the volume of a cone, you can use the following formula:

Volume = (1/3) * π * radius² * height

In the code provided, the function volume_cone takes two arguments, r and h, representing the radius and height of the cone, respectively. It then calculates the volume using the formula above and returns the result.

To test the function, the assert statement is used to check if the volume of a cone with radius 5 and height 12, calculated using the function, is approximately equal to the expected value of 314.15926535897927, allowing for a relative tolerance of 0.001. This ensures that the function is correctly implementing the formula for the volume of a cone.

In summary, the provided code defines a function to calculate the volume of a cone using the given radius and height, and verifies its accuracy through an assert statement.

# As per the problem statement, assert math.isclose(volume_cone(5,12), 314.15926535897927, rel_tol=0.001)
# Here, rel_tol means relative tolerance, i.e., the maximum relative error.

# The relative tolerance, rel_tol, is the maximum relative error between two values. It is defined as the absolute error (|a - b|) divided by the smaller of the two values (a and b).

# For example, if we have two values a and b, and we want to compare them within a tolerance of 0.01, we can use the following formula to calculate the relative tolerance:

# rel_tol = abs(a - b) / min(a, b)

# If the relative tolerance is less than 0.01, then the two values are considered equal within the specified tolerance. Otherwise
