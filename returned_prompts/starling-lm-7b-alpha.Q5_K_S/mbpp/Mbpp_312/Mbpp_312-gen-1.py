In this code, the author defines a function called `volume_cone` that takes in two parameters: `r` (the radius of the cone) and `h` (the height of the cone). The function calculates the volume of the cone using the formula `(1/3) * math.pi * r ** 2 * h` and returns the result. 

The author also includes an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block at the end of the code to test the `volume_cone` function. They import the `math` module and use the `math.isclose` function to compare the result of `volume_cone(5,12)` with the expected value of `314.15926535897927` within a relative tolerance of `0.001`. This ensures that the calculated volume is close to the expected value within the specified tolerance.

By running this code, the author verifies that the `volume_cone` function correctly calculates the volume of a cone with the given radius and height.

# Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

# 1. The author defines a function called `volume_cone` that takes in two parameters: `r` (the radius of the cone) and `h` (the height of the cone).

# 2. Inside the `volume_cone` function, the author calculates the volume of the cone using the formula `(1/3) * math.pi * r ** 2 * h` and returns the result.

# 3. The author includes an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block at the end of the code to test the `volume_cone` function.

# 4. Inside the `if __name__ == '
