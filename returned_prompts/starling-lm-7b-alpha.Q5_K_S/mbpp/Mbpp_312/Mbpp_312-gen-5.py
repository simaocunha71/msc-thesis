"""
Here is a simple function to calculate the volume of a cone:

def volume_cone(radius, height):
    return (1/3) * math.pi * radius**2 * height

The radius and height are passed as parameters to the function. The function then uses the formula for the volume of a cone, which is (1/3) * pi * radius^2 * height. The math.pi is imported from the math module to represent the value of pi. The radius is squared using the exponent operator **, and then multiplied by the height. The result is the volume of the cone.
"""

def volume_cone(radius, height):
    return (1/3) * math.pi * radius**2 * height

# Testing the function
import math
assert math.isclose(volume_cone(5,12), 314.15926535897927, rel_tol=0.001)

"""
Here is an example of how to use the function to calculate the volume of a cone with a radius of 5 and a height of 12:

volume = volume_cone(5, 12)
print(volume) # Output: 314.15926535897927

The function is called with the radius and height as arguments, and the result is stored in the variable volume. The volume is then printed to the console. The expected output is 314.15926535897927, which is confirmed by the assert statement.
