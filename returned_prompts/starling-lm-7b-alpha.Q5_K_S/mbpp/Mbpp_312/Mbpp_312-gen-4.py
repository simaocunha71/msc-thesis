Here's one possible solution using the math library in Python:

"""
import math

def volume_cone(r, h):
    """
    Function to find the volume of a cone.
    """
    # calculate the volume using the formula pi * r^2 * h / 3
    volume = math.pi * (r**2) * h / 3
    return volume

# Test
assert math.isclose(volume_cone(5,12), 314.15926535897927, rel_tol=0.001)

"""
In this solution, we define a function called volume_cone that takes two arguments, r and h, representing the radius and height of the cone, respectively. Inside the function, we calculate the volume using the formula pi * r^2 * h / 3 and return the result. We then test the function with the values 5 and 12, and assert that the result is close to the expected value of 314.15926535897927 within a relative tolerance of 0.001.

# Here's another possible solution using the numpy library in Python:

import numpy as np

In this solution, we use the numpy library to define a function called volume_cone that takes two arguments, r and h, representing the radius and height of the cone, respectively. Inside the function, we calculate the volume using the same formula as in the previous solution, but using the numpy pi constant and the numpy power function. We then return the result. We test the function with the same values as before, and assert that the result is close to the expected value within a relative
