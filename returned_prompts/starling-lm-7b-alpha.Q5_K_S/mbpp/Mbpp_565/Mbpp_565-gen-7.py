"""
This function works by taking the string as an argument and then converting the string to a list. This is done by using the built-in function list(), which is a built-in function in Python that converts an iterable (like a string) into a list. The function then returns the list that was created from the string. The assert statement is used to check if the function is working correctly by comparing the result of the function with the expected output.
