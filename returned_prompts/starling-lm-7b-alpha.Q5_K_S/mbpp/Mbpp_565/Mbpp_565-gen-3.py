def split(s):
    return list(s)


# Testing the function
print(split('python'))  # Output: ['p', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n']


















"""
In this code, the function `split` takes a string `s` as input and returns a list of its characters using the `list` function. The `list` function converts the string into a list of characters, effectively splitting the string into its individual characters.

To test the function, the code uses the `print` statement to display the result of calling the `split` function with the string `'python'`. The expected output is `['p', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n']`, which is the list representation of the characters in the string `'python'`.

The `assert` statement is used to check if the function produces the expected output. If the actual output does not match the expected output, an `AssertionError` will be raised.

Overall, this code demonstrates a Python function that splits a string into its characters and prints the result.
