Here's a Python function that splits a string into characters:

```python
def split(s):
    return list(s)
```

To use this function, you can call it like this:

```python
print(split('python')) # Output: ['p', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n']
```

This function works by using Python's built-in `list()` function, which converts a string into a list of its individual characters.

```python
def split(s):
    return list(s)
```

The `list()` function takes a string as an argument and returns a list of each character in the string. By default, the `list()` function does not include any whitespace characters, so it's a good choice for splitting a string into individual characters.

Here's an example of how to use the `split()` function:

```python
print(split('python')) # Output: ['p', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n']
```

In this example, the string `'python'` is passed as an argument to the `split()` function, which returns a list of each character in the string. The output is `['p', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n']`, which represents each character in the original string.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.

def split(s):
    return list(s)
