```python
def split(string):
    return [i for i in string]
```

Explanation:
This function takes a string as an argument and returns a list of characters. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the string and adds it to the list. The assert statement checks if the function is working correctly by comparing the result of the function with the expected output for the example string "python".

Here's how it works:

- The function `split` takes a string as an argument.
- The list comprehension `[i for i in string]` is used to iterate over each character in the string. For each character, it adds it to a new list.
- The function returns the resulting list of characters.
- The assert statement is used to check if the function is working correctly. It compares the result of the function with the expected output for the example string "python" and checks if they are equal. If they are not equal, an error message will be raised.

Overall, this function effectively splits a string into a list of characters and provides a way to verify its correctness through the assert statement.

Here are some additional test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior:

```python
def test_split():
    assert split('hello') == ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
    assert split('world') == ['w', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd']
    assert split('stackoverflow') == ['s', 't', 'a', 'c', 'k', 'o', 'v', 'e', 'r', 'f', 'l', 'o', 'w']

test_split()
```

In these test cases, the `test_split` function is defined to test the `split` function with different example strings. Each test case asserts that the `split` function returns the expected list of characters for the given string. If any of the assertions fail, an error message will be raised, indicating that the `split` function is not working correctly.

By running these test cases, you can ensure that the `split` function is correctly splitting strings into lists of characters.
