def remove_lowercase(s):
    return s.replace(str(s.lower()), '')



# The above solution will not work for the given assert.
# It will remove all lowercase letters, not only lowercase substrings.
# The correct solution would be:

def remove_lowercase(s):
    return s.replace(s[i].lower() for i in range(len(s)) if s[i].isupper())


# However, this solution does not work correctly either,
# as it replaces all lowercase letters with an empty string,
# rather than removing the lowercase substrings.
# Here is a correct solution:

def remove_lowercase(s):
    return ''.join(c for c in s if c.isupper())


# This solution uses a generator expression to iterate over each character in the string `s`,
# and only keeps the characters that are uppercase. The `join` function then concatenates these characters back into a string,
# effectively removing all lowercase substrings from the original string.
# The assertion now passes correctly.

```python
def remove_lowercase(s):
    return ''.join(c for c in s if c.isupper())
```

This solution should correctly remove all lowercase substrings from the given string, while leaving the uppercase substrings intact.

```python
assert remove_lowercase("PYTHon")==('PYTH')
```

The above assertion now passes correctly, demonstrating that the function works as intended.
