def remove_lowercase(s):
    return ''.join([i for i in s if i.isupper()])


# Test:
print(remove_lowercase("PYTHon"))  # Expected: 'PYTH'


# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(1)
#
# Here's a Python implementation of the above algorithm:
#

# Python3 program to remove lowercase
# substrings from a given string

# Function to remove lowercase substrings
def remove_lowercase(s):
    return ''.join([i for i in s if i.isupper()])

# Driver code
print(remove_lowercase("PYTHon"))  # Expected: 'PYTH'
