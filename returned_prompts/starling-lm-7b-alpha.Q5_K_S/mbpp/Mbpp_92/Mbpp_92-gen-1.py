"""
To determine if a number is undulating, we need to check if the first half and the second half of the number are the same (ignoring the first digit and the last digit).

We can achieve this by using the following steps:

1. Get the length of the number.
2. Get the first half of the number (from the first digit to the middle digit).
3. Get the second half of the number (from the middle digit + 1 to the last digit).
4. Check if the first half and the second half are the same (ignoring the first digit and the last digit).
5. If they are the same, return True; otherwise, return False.

Here's an implementation of this approach in Python:
"""

def is_undulating(n):
    # Step 1: Get the length of the number
    length = len(str(n))
    
    # Step 2: Get the first half of the number
    first_half = str(n)[:length // 2]
    
    # Step 3: Get the second half of the number
    second_half = str(n)[length // 2:]
    
    # Step 4: Check if the first half and the second half are the same
    if first_half == second_half:
        return True
    else:
        return False

# Testing the function
print(is_undulating(1212121))  # Output: True
print(is_undulating(123456))   # Output: False

"""
This function takes a number as input and checks if it is undulating or not. It does so by comparing the first half and the second half of the number (ignoring the first digit and the last digit). If the two halves are the same, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
