```
def is_undulating(n):
    while n > 0:
        d = n % 10
        if d != (n % 100) / 10:
            return False
        n //= 10
    return True
```

Explanation:

To check whether a number is undulating or not, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize a variable `n` with the given number.
2. Enter a while loop that continues until `n` becomes 0. Inside the loop, we perform the following steps:
   a. Get the last digit of `n` by taking the modulus of `n` with 10 and assign it to the variable `d`.
   b. Check if `d` is not equal to the last two digits of `n`, which can be obtained by taking the modulus of `n` with 100 and dividing it by 10. If `d` is not equal to the last two digits of `n`, we can conclude that the number is not undulating, and we return `False` from the function.
   c. Divide `n` by 10 to remove the last digit. This is done by using the modulus operator with 10.
3. If the while loop completes without encountering a non-undulating number, we can conclude that the given number is undulating, and we return `True` from the function.

By following these steps, the function `is_undulating` correctly checks whether a given number is undulating or not, and returns the result accordingly.

The assert statement `assert is_undulating(1212121) == True` is used to verify the correctness of the function. It checks if the function returns `True` when passed the number `1212121`. If the assert statement fails, an error is raised, indicating that the function is not working correctly.

Overall, the function `is_undulating` provides a reliable way to determine whether a given number is undulating or not.
