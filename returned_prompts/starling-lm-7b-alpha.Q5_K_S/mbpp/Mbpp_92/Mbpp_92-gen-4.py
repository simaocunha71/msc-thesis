```
def is_undulating(n):
    str_n = str(n)
    return all(str_n[i] == str_n[len(str_n)-i-1] for i in range(len(str_n)//2))
```

Explanation:
The function is_undulating takes a number as an input and checks if the digits in the number form a mirror image around the middle digit. It does this by first converting the number to a string and then comparing each digit with its corresponding digit from the end of the string. The function returns True if all the digits match their mirrored counterparts, and False otherwise. The all function is used to check if all the comparisons return True.

In the provided example, the number 1212121 is passed to the function is_undulating. The function converts the number to a string and compares each digit with its mirrored counterpart. Since all the digits match their mirrored counterparts, the function returns True.

This solution effectively determines whether a number is undulating or not by comparing its digits to their mirrored counterparts.

Additionally, the time complexity of this solution is O(n) because it iterates through each digit of the number to perform the comparison. The space complexity is O(1) because it only requires a single string to store the digits of the number.
