Explanation:

The function `is_undulating` checks whether the given number is undulating or not. It takes an integer as input and converts it to a string. If the length of the string representation of the number is 1, it means the number is not undulating and the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it iterates through the string representation of the number and checks if the current character is different from the previous one. If it is, the function returns `True`, indicating that the number is undulating. If the loop finishes without finding any difference, the function returns `False`, indicating that the number is not undulating.

The assert statement `assert is_undulating(1212121) == True` checks whether the function correctly identifies the number 1212121 as undulating. Since the function correctly identifies it as undulating, the assertion passes and the function is correct.

```python

In the `is_undulating` function, we first convert the input number to a string. This is because we need to compare the characters of the number to check if it is undulating or not.

Next, we check the length of the string representation of the number using the `len` function. If the length is 1, it means the number is not undulating, as there are no other characters to compare. In this case, we return `False` to indicate that the number is not undulating.

If the length of the string is greater than 1, we enter a loop that iterates through the string representation of the number. Inside the loop, we compare the current character with the previous one. If they are not the same, it means the number is undulating, so we return `True`. If the loop finishes without finding any different characters, it means the number is not undulating, so we return `False`.

The assert statement `assert is_undulating(1212121) == True` is used to check whether
