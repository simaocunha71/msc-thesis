```
def is_undulating(num):
    return (num[0] != num[-1]) and (num[0] == num[len(num)//2])
```

Explanation:

To determine if a number is undulating or not, we can check if the first and last digits are not equal, and if the first digit is equal to the middle digit of the number. This is because, in an undulating number, the first and last digits should not be the same, and the first digit should be the same as the digit in the middle of the number.

In the provided solution, the `is_undulating` function takes a number `num` as input and returns `True` if the number is undulating, and `False` otherwise. It checks if the first digit (`num[0]`) is not equal to the last digit (`num[-1]`), and if the first digit is equal to the middle digit of the number (`num[0] == num[len(num)//2]`). If both conditions are satisfied, the function returns `True`, indicating that the number is undulating. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The assertion `assert is_undulating(1212121) == True` is included to test the function. It checks if the `is_undulating` function correctly identifies the given number `1212121` as undulating, and the expected output is `True`.

Overall, this solution provides a concise and efficient way to determine if a given number is undulating or not.

```python
def is_undulating(num):
    return (num[0] != num[-1]) and (num[0] == num[len(num)//2])
```

This function `is_undulating` takes a number `num` as input and returns `True` if the number is undulating, and `False` otherwise. It checks if the first digit (`num[0]`) is not equal to the last digit (`num[-1]`), and if the first digit is equal to the middle digit of the number (`num[0] == num[len(num)//2]`). If both conditions are satisfied, the function returns `True`, indicating that the number is
