def is_undulating(n):
    return len(set(str(n))) == 2 and all(i == n[i] for i in range(len(n)))
```

Explanation:

To check whether a number is undulating or not, we can follow these steps:

1. Convert the number to a string and store it in `n`. This will allow us to easily compare each digit of the number.
2. Create a set with the digits in `n` using the `set()` function. This will remove any duplicate digits and leave us with only the unique digits in the number.
3. Check if the length of the set is equal to 2. If it is, it means that the number has only two unique digits and is undulating.
4. If the length of the set is not equal to 2, we need to check if each digit in the number is equal to its position in the number. This can be done using a generator expression and the `all()` function. The generator expression `(i == n[i] for i in range(len(n)))` will return a sequence of `True` or `False` values indicating whether each digit is equal to its position. If all the values in the sequence are `True`, it means that the number is undulating.
5. If the length of the set is not equal to 2 or not all the values in the sequence generated by the generator expression are `True`, it means that the number is not undulating.

The provided code implements these steps and returns `True` if the number is undulating and `False` otherwise.

The `assert` statement at the beginning of the code is used to test the function and ensure that it returns the correct result for the given example (`1212121`).

Overall, the code provides a simple and efficient solution to check whether a number is undulating or not.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

- The `is_undulating()` function takes a single argument `n`, which is the number to be checked.
- Inside the function, the number `n` is converted to a string using the `str()` function and stored in the variable `n`.
- The set of unique digits in `n` is created using the `
