In the count_reverse_pairs function, we compare each string in the string_list with the reverse of each other string.
Since we compare each string with every other string, the time complexity is O(n^2), where n is the length of the string_list.

"""
The time complexity of the count_reverse_pairs function is O(n^2), where n is the length of the string_list.
This is because we are comparing each string in the string_list with every other string, which takes O(n^2) time.

The space complexity of the count_reverse_pairs function is O(1).
We only use a constant amount of extra space (the count variable), so the space complexity is O(1).

"""
The count_reverse_pairs function counts the number of pairs of reverse strings in a given string list.
It does this by comparing each string in the list with the reverse of every other string in the list.
If a string is equal to the reverse of another string, it increments the count variable.
Finally, it returns the count of reverse pairs.

"""
To test the count_reverse_pairs function, you can use the print statement to print the result of calling the function with a sample input.
In this case, we are testing the function with the input ["julia", "best", "tseb", "for", "ailuj"].
