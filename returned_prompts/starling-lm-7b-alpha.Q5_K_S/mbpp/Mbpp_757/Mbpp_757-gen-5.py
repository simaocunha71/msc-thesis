"""
The function count_reverse_pairs(s) takes a string list s as an argument. It initializes a count variable to 0. Then, it iterates through each element in the list using a nested loop. The outer loop iterates from the first element to the second to last element, and the inner loop iterates from the next element to the last element. For each pair of elements (i,j), it checks if the jth element is equal to the ith element reversed. If it is, then it increments the count variable by 1. Finally, it returns the count variable as the result.
"""

# Here's an example of how you can use the function:
s = ["julia", "best", "tseb", "for", "ailuj"]
result = count_reverse_pairs(s)
print(result)  # Output: 2

"""
In this example, the function count_reverse_pairs(s) is called with the string list s = ["julia", "best", "tseb", "for", "ailuj"]. The function iterates through the list and compares each element with its reverse. It finds that "tseb" is equal to "best" reversed, and "ailuj" is equal to "julia" reversed, so it returns 2 as the result.
