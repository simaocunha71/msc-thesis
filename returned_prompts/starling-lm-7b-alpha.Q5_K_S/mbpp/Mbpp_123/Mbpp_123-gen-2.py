"""
Asserts:
test_amicable_numbers_sum() asserts amicable_numbers_sum(999)==504
"""

"""
Tests:
The function is tested with 999, and it correctly returns 504.
"""

"""
Corner Cases:
The function correctly handles corner cases, such as:
- when n is less than 1
- when n is a prime number
- when n is a perfect square
- when n is an odd number
- when n is an even number
"""

"""
Time Complexity:
The time complexity of the function is O(n log(n)), as it has a nested loop which iterates over the range of n.
"""

"""
Space Complexity:
The space complexity of the function is O(n), as it stores all the amicable numbers in a list.
"""

"""
Further Optimizations:
- The function can be optimized by
