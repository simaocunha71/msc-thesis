"""
This function checks if the substring is present in any of the strings in the given list of strings. If the substring is present in any of the strings, the function returns True. If the substring is not present in any of the strings, the function returns False. The function uses a for loop to iterate over the list of strings. For each string in the list, it checks if the substring is present in the string using the 'in' keyword. If the substring is found in a string, the function returns True and stops the iteration. If the iteration completes without finding the substring in any of the strings, the function returns False. The function also includes tests to check its correctness and edge cases.
"""

# Time Complexity: O(n*m), where n is the length of the list of strings and m is the length of the substring.
# Space Complexity: O(1), as the function uses a constant amount of extra space to store the result.

# Stability: The function is stable, meaning that the order of the strings in the list and the order of the characters in the substring are preserved.

# Scalability: The function is scalable, meaning that it can handle large inputs without running out of memory or taking too much time.
