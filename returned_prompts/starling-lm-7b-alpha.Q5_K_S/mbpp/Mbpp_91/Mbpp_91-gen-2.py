"""
The function find_substring(list_of_strings, substring) is defined to check if a string is present as a substring in a given list of string values. This function iterates over the list_of_strings and checks if the substring is present in each string of the list. If the substring is found in any of the strings, the function returns True. If the substring is not found in any of the strings, the function returns False.

Explanation:
In the provided solution, the function find_substring(list_of_strings, substring) is defined. It takes two parameters: list_of_strings (the list of strings to be checked) and substring (the string to be searched as a substring in the list of strings). 

Inside the function, a for loop is used to iterate over each string in the list_of_strings. For each string, the function checks if the substring is present using the 'in' operator. If the substring is found in the string, the function immediately returns True. If the substring is not found in any of the strings, the function returns False after the loop is complete.

In the given example, the function is called with the list_of_strings=["red", "black", "white", "green", "orange"] and substring="ack". The function checks each string in the list and finds that the substring "ack" is present in the string "black". Therefore, the function returns True, as indicated by the assert statement.
