def replace_list(lst1, lst2):
  lst1[-1:] = lst2
  return lst1

# assert replace_list([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10],[2, 4, 6, 8])==[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8]

# Function Explanation:
# The function replace_list takes in two lists, lst1 and lst2 as arguments. It uses the slicing feature of Python to replace the last element of lst1 with the elements of lst2. The slice [-1:] selects the last element of lst1 and replaces it with the entire lst2. Finally, the function returns the modified lst1.

# This function can be used to replace the last element of a list with the elements of another list by simply calling the function with the appropriate arguments. The provided assert statement verifies the correctness of the function by comparing the result of the function with the expected output.

```python
# Function Definition
def replace_list(lst1, lst2):
  lst1[-1:] = lst2
  return lst1

# Function Testing
print(replace_list([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10],[2, 4, 6, 8]))  # Output: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8]
```

In the above example, the function replace_list is called with two lists as arguments: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10] and [2, 4, 6, 8]. The function modifies the last element of the first list to be the elements of the second list. The result is then printed, which is [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8]. This demonstrates the functionality of the function and confirms its correctness.

To use the function, you can simply call it with the desired lists as arguments. The function will modify the last element
