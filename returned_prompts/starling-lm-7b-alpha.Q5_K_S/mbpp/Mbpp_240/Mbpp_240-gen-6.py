"""
To solve this problem, we can use the concatenation operator (+) to combine the two lists and then replace the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. Use the concatenation operator (+) to combine the two lists: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10] + [2, 4, 6, 8].
2. The result of the concatenation is [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 2, 4, 6, 8].
3. Replace the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8].
4. The final result is [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8].

from typing import List
def replace_list(lst1: List[int], lst2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    return lst1[:-1] + lst2

# Example usage:
result = replace_list([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10], [2, 4, 6, 8])
print(result)  # Output: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8]
