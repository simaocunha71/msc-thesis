def replace_list(lst1, lst2):
    lst1[-1:] = lst2
    return lst1


def replace_list(lst1, lst2):
    lst1.extend(lst2)
    lst1.pop()
    return lst1




# Driver program to test the above function
# print(replace_list([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10], [2, 4, 6, 8]))

```
Here's a Python solution for the given problem:

```python
def replace_list(lst1, lst2):
    # Add all elements of lst2 to lst1
    lst1.extend(lst2)

    # Remove the last element of lst1
    lst1.pop()

    return lst1
```

This function, `replace_list`, takes in two lists: `lst1` and `lst2`. It first extends `lst1` with all the elements of `lst2`. Then, it pops the last element of `lst1`, effectively replacing it with the elements of `lst2`. Finally, it returns the modified `lst1`.

You can test the function with the provided example:

```python
print(replace_list([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10], [2, 4, 6, 8]))
```

This will output: `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8]`, which is the expected result.

Note that this solution assumes that the second list (`lst2`) is always shorter than or equal to the length of the first list (`lst1`). If the second list is longer, you may need to modify the code to handle this case.
```

```

```python
def replace_list(lst1, lst2):
    # If the length of lst2 is less than or equal to the length of lst1
    if len(lst2) <= len(lst1):
        # Add all elements of lst2 to lst1
