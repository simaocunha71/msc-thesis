    return len(result) != 0
```

Here, we use the regular expression method to find the words that contain 'z'.

Explanation:
"""
text_match_wordz(text):
"""
This function will take a string as a parameter and return True if the string contains a word that contains 'z'. If the string does not contain a word with 'z', it will return False.

The regular expression r'\b[a-zA-Z]*z[a-zA-Z]*\b' is used to find all the words that contain 'z'. Here, [a-zA-Z] represents any alphabetic letter, and \b represents the word boundary. So, r'\b[a-zA-Z]*z[a-zA-Z]*\b' will find all the words that contain 'z'.

Finally, we check if the result is not empty, and if it is not empty, we return True. Otherwise, we return False.

In the provided example, text_match_wordz("pythonz.") will return True, because the word "pythonz." contains 'z'.
