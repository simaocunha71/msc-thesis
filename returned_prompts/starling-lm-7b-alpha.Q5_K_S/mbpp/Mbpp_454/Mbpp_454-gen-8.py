text_match_wordz("pythonz.") == True

# This code defines a function called `text_match_wordz` that takes in a string `text` as an argument. The function checks if the string `text` contains the character `'z'`. If it does, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

# The `assert` statement is a way to check if a condition is true or false. In this case, it is used to check if the `text_match_wordz` function correctly matches the word "pythonz." when the `z` character is present in the word. The expected result is `True`, which means that the function should return `True` when the word contains `'z'`.

# The function `text_match_wordz` is defined using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name and the parentheses containing the input parameter `text`. Inside the function, the `in` operator is used to check if the character `'z'` is present in the `text` string. If it is, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

# The `assert` statement is used to verify the correctness of the function by comparing the result of `text_match_wordz` with the expected result, which is `True` in this case. If the assertion is true, meaning that the function correctly matches the word with `'z'`, the program continues running. If the assertion is false, an error is raised, indicating that there is an issue with the function.

# Overall, this code defines a function to match a word containing the character `'z'` and checks if it correctly identifies the presence of `'z'` in the word "pythonz.".
