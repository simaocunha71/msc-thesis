```

In this solution, the function kth_element takes two parameters: arr, which is the input array, and k, which is the index of the element we want to find. The function uses the sorted() function to sort the array in ascending order. Then, it returns the element at index k-1 in the sorted array, which corresponds to the kth element in the original array. The function is tested with three different inputs to verify its correctness.
