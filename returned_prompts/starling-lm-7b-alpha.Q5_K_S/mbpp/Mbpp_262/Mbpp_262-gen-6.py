"""
Here is a possible solution to the problem:

def split_two_parts(lst, L):
    return (lst[:L], lst[L:])

This function takes in two parameters: lst, which is the original list, and L, which is the desired length of the first part of the list. It then uses list slicing to create two new lists, one containing the first L elements of the original list, and the other containing the remaining elements. These two lists are then returned in a tuple as the result of the function.

The assert statement provided asserts that the function correctly splits the list [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,1] into two parts, where the first part has a length of 3, and the resulting lists are [1, 1, 2] and [3, 4, 4, 5, 1] respectively. This confirms that the function is working correctly.
