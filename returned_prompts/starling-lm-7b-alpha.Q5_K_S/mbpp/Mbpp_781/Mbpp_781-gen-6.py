Here is a Python function to check whether the count of divisors is even:

```python
def count_divisors(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1
    if count % 2 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

You can use the `count_divisors` function like this:

```python
assert count_divisors(10)  # This will return True
```

The function `count_divisors` takes a number `n` as an input. It initializes a variable `count` to zero. Then, it iterates through all numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). If `n` is divisible by the current number (i.e., the remainder of the division is zero), it increments the `count` by one. After the loop, it checks if the `count` is even (i.e., divisible by 2). If it is, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

The `assert` statement checks whether the `count_divisors` function returns the expected result for a given input (in this case, `10`). If the assertion fails (i.e., the function does not return the expected result), an `AssertionError` is raised.

In this case, the `count_divisors` function correctly counts the number of divisors for the input `10`, which is `4`. Since `4` is even, the assertion is successful, and no error is raised.

```python
def count_divisors(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1
    if count % 2 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

This function calculates the count of divisors for a given number `n`. It uses a for loop to iterate through all numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). If `n` is divisible by the current number (i.e., the remainder of
