To check:

The above code will return the minimum number of rotations greater than 0 required to get the same string.

For example, if we have the string "aaaa", then the minimum number of rotations required to get the same string is 1. However, if we have the string "abcdef", then the minimum number of rotations required to get the same string is 3.

The function works by checking the length of each substring of the string and comparing it to the length of the original string. If the length of the substring is equal to the length of the original string and the substring is the same as the original string, then the function returns the length of the substring as the minimum number of rotations required to get the same string.

The function also returns 0 if no such rotation is found.

The function is correct and should pass the assertions provided.

The time complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because the function iterates over each substring of the string and checks if it is equal to the original string.

The space complexity of the function is O(1), as it only uses a fixed amount
