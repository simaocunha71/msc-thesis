In this problem, we need to find the minimum number of rotations required to get the same string.
To solve this problem, we can concatenate the string with itself to create a new string that has all the rotations of the original string. Then we can find the number of times the original string appears in the new string. The minimum number of rotations required to get the same string is equal to the number of times the original string appears in the new string.
Here's a Python function that implements this approach:

```python
def find_Rotations(s):
    temp = s + s
    n = len(s)
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if (temp[i:i+n] == s):
            count += 1
    return count
```

To test this function, we can call `find_Rotations("aaaa")`, which should return `1` because the string "aaaa" has only one rotation that is equal to itself.

```python
print(find_Rotations("aaaa"))
```

This will output `1`, as expected.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. The space complexity is also O(n), as we create a new string that is twice the length of the input string.

Overall, this function provides an efficient solution to find the minimum number of rotations required to get the same string in Python.

```python
def find_Rotations(s):
    temp = s + s
    n = len(s)
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if (temp[i:i+n] == s):
            count += 1
    return count
```

By using this function, you can easily determine the minimum number of rotations needed to obtain the same string in Python.

```python
print(
