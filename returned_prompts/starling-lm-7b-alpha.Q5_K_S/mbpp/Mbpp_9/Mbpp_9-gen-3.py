```
The above code defines a function `find_Rotations` which takes a string `s` as input. The function uses a `for` loop to iterate through the indices of the string. It checks if the substring from the start of the string to index `i` is equal to the substring from index `i` to the end of the string. If they are equal, it means that the string can be rotated by `i` positions to get the same string, and the function returns `i + 1` as the minimum number of rotations required.

The function uses a simple approach to find the minimum number of rotations. It compares the substrings at different positions in the string and finds the one that matches the entire string. The time complexity of this approach is O(n^2), where n is the length of the string. This is because for each position in the string, it needs to compare the substring with the entire string, which takes O(n) time.

The function can be used to find the minimum number of rotations required to get the same string. For example, if we call `find_Rotations("aaaa")`, it will return 1, indicating that the string "aaaa" can be rotated by 1 position to get the same string.
