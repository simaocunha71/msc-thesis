"""
Explanation:
The function unique_Element takes a list of numbers, nums, as an argument. It creates a set from the list using the set() function. Since a set only contains unique elements, if all elements in the list are the same, the set will have only one element. The function then checks if the length of the set is equal to 1, and returns True if it is, and False otherwise. The assert statement is used to verify that the function correctly identifies the input [1,1,1] as having only one distinct element.
