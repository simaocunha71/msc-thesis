```
def unique_Element(list_):
    return len(set(list_)) == 1
```

Explanation:
In this task, we need to check whether a list contains only one distinct element or not. We can convert the list to a set, as a set only contains unique elements. Then, we can compare the length of the set to the length of the original list. If they are equal, it means all the elements in the list are distinct; otherwise, the list contains more than one distinct element.

In the provided Python function, we first convert the input list to a set using the set() function. Then, we compare the length of the set to the length of the original list using the len() function. If they are equal, the function returns True, indicating that the list contains only one distinct element. Otherwise, the function returns False.

To test the function, we can use the assert keyword to check the expected output. In this case, we expect the function to return True when the input list is [1,1,1], as all the elements in the list are the same.

Overall, this function provides a simple and efficient way to check whether a list contains only one distinct element or not.
