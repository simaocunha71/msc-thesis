def extract_string(string_list, size):
    return [s for s in string_list if len(s) >= size]
```

Explanation:
In this answer, we are using list comprehension to filter out the strings from the given list that are of specified size or greater than the specified size.

Here, `string_list` is the given list of string values and `size` is the specified size.

The list comprehension `[s for s in string_list if len(s) >= size]` goes through each string `s` in the `string_list` and checks if the length of the string is greater than or equal to the `size`. If it is, the string is added to the resulting list.

The `return` statement then returns the resulting list of strings that satisfy the condition.

In the provided example, the function `extract_string(['Python', 'list', 'exercises', 'practice', 'solution'] ,8)` is called with a list of strings and a size of 8. This will return a new list containing the strings 'practice' and 'solution', as they are the only two strings in the given list that have a length of 8 or greater.

The `assert` statement is used to verify that the function is working correctly by comparing the output of the function with the expected result.

Overall, this function allows you to extract strings from a given list based on their length, specifically selecting those that are equal to or greater than the specified size.

```python
def extract_string(string_list, size):
    return [s for s in string_list if len(s) >= size]
```

This function takes in a list of strings and a size as input, and returns a new list containing only the strings from the input list that have a length equal to or greater than the specified size. The function uses list comprehension to iterate over each string in the input list and check its length. If the length of a string is greater than or equal to the size, the string is added to the new list. Finally, the function returns the new list.

Here's an example of how to use this function:
```python
string_list = ['Python', 'list', 'exercises
