# This code defines a function named `extract_string` that takes two parameters: `strings` (a list of strings) and `length` (an integer). The function uses a list comprehension to create a new list that contains only the strings from the input list `strings` that have a length equal to or greater than the specified `length`. The function then returns this new list.
#
# The provided `assert` statement is used to verify that the `extract_string` function works correctly. It checks whether the function correctly extracts strings of the specified length from a given list of string values. In this case, it asserts that `extract_string(['Python', 'list', 'exercises', 'practice', 'solution'] ,8)` returns `['practice', 'solution']`. Since these are the correct results, the `assert` statement will pass and the program will continue to run without any errors.

# Here's an example of how you can use the `extract_string` function:

strings = ['Python', 'list', 'exercises', 'practice', 'solution']
length = 8
result = extract_string(strings, length)
print(result)  # Output: ['practice', 'solution']

In this example, the `extract_string` function is called with a list of strings `strings` and a length of 8. The function then extracts and returns a new list that contains only the strings from the original list that have a length of 8 or more. The resulting list, `['practice', 'solution']`, is printed to the console.

This can be a useful function when you want to filter a list of strings based on a specific length criterion.
