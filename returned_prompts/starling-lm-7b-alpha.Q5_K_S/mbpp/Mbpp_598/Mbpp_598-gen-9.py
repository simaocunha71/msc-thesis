The function `armstrong_number` takes an integer `num` as input and returns a boolean value. It first calculates the number of digits in `num` by converting it to a string and finding its length. Then, it initializes a variable `sum_of_cubes` to store the sum of the cubes of the individual digits of `num`. 

Next, it enters a while loop that iterates until `temp` becomes zero. Inside the loop, it calculates the cube of the rightmost digit of `num` using the modulo operator `%` and adds it to `sum_of_cubes`. Then, it removes the rightmost digit from `num` by using the floor division operator `//`. 

Once the loop finishes, the function compares `sum_of_cubes` with `num`. If they are equal, it means that `num` is an Armstrong number, and the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

The assert statement at the end of the code checks whether the function correctly identifies 153 as an Armstrong number by comparing the result of `armstrong_number(153)` with True. If the assertion passes, it means that the function is working correctly.

Here are some additional notes about the code:

- The function uses the `len()` function to calculate the number of digits in `num`. It converts `num` to a string using the `str()` function, as Python's built-in `len()` function only works with strings and other sequence types.
- The function uses the modulo operator `
