```
def concatenate_tuple(tup):
    return '-'.join(map(str, tup))
```

Explanation:
The `join` method is a string method that concatenates all elements of an iterable (in this case, the tuple) with a specified delimiter. By converting each tuple element to a string using the `map` function and joining them with a hyphen, the function concatenates the tuple elements into a single string with hyphens as the delimiter.

The function `concatenate_tuple` takes a tuple as input and uses the `join` method to concatenate the elements with hyphens. The `map` function is used to convert each tuple element to a string before joining them. The `join` method returns the concatenated string, which is then returned by the function.

To test the function, the assert statement is used to verify that the function correctly concatenates the tuple elements with hyphens. The expected output is the string 'ID-is-4-UTS'.

Overall, the function successfully concatenates each element of the tuple using hyphens as the delimiter, as required by the problem statement.

```python
def concatenate_tuple(tup):
    return '-'.join(map(str, tup))
```

This function concatenates each element of the tuple using hyphens as the delimiter, as specified in the problem statement. The `join` method is used to concatenate the tuple elements with hyphens, and the `map` function is used to convert each tuple element to a string before joining them. The function returns the concatenated string, which is then tested using an assert statement to verify the correctness of the implementation.

The provided code successfully solves the problem of concatenating each element of a tuple using hyphens as the delimiter, and the assert statement confirms that the function produces the expected output.

```python
def concatenate_tuple(tup):
    return '-'.join(map(str, tup))
```

The function `concatenate_tuple` takes a tuple as input and uses the `join` method to concatenate the elements with hyphens. The `map` function is used to convert each tuple element to a string before joining them. The
