```python
def concatenate_tuple(t):
    return '-'.join(map(str, t))
```

Explanation:
The function `concatenate_tuple` takes a tuple as input and uses the `map` function to convert each element of the tuple to a string. Then it uses the `join` method of the string class to concatenate all the elements with a hyphen ("-") between them. The resulting string is then returned.

The provided assertion `assert concatenate_tuple(("ID", "is", 4, "UTS") ) == 'ID-is-4-UTS'` is a way to test the function. It checks if the output of the `concatenate_tuple` function with the input tuple ("ID", "is", 4, "UTS") is equal to the expected output string 'ID-is-4-UTS'. If the assertion is true, it means that the function is working correctly.

Overall, the function `concatenate_tuple` takes a tuple of any type of elements and concatenates them into a single string, separated by hyphens ("-").
