"""
In this problem we are given a tuple and a delimiter. We need to concatenate each element of the tuple with the given delimiter.

Here is the step by step logic to solve this problem:

First, define a function called concatenate_tuple that takes two parameters: a tuple and a delimiter.

In the body of the function, initialize a variable called result to an empty string. This will be the final concatenated string.

Next, iterate over each element in the tuple. For each element, concatenate it with the delimiter and the result variable. This can be done by using the += operator.

Finally, return the result variable as the output of the function.

Here's the Python code that solves this problem:
"""

def concatenate_tuple(tup, delimiter):
    result = ""
    for elem in tup:
        result += str(elem) + delimiter
    return result[:-1]

# Test the function
assert concatenate_tuple(("ID", "is", 4, "UTS"), "-") == 'ID-is-4-UTS'

# This code defines a function called concatenate_tuple that takes a tuple and a delimiter as parameters.
# It initializes a variable called result to an empty string.
# It then iterates over each element in the tuple, concatenating it with the delimiter and the result variable using the += operator.
# Finally, it returns the result variable as the output of the function.
# The assert statement at the end of the code tests the function by passing in a tuple and a delimiter, and checking that the output matches the expected result.

# The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the tuple, because we are iterating over each element in the tuple.
# The space complexity is O(1), because we are only using a fixed number of variables, regardless of the size of the input tuple.

# This solution is efficient and has a low space complexity, making it a good choice for concatenating a tuple with a delimiter.

# Here are some additional test cases to validate the solution:

# assert concatenate_tuple(("Hello", "World"), "-") == "Hello-World"
