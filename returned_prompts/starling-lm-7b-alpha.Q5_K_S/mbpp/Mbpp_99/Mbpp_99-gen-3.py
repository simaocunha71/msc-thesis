Here's a function that converts a decimal number to its binary equivalent as a string with no leading zeros. The function works by repeatedly dividing the input number by 2 and appending the remainder to the left of the string representation. The function uses recursion to handle the division step.

The `decimal_to_binary` function first checks if the input number `n` is equal to 0. If it is, it returns the string "0" as the binary representation of 0. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with the input `n` divided by 2 and appends the remainder (obtained using the modulo operator `%`) to the left of the string representation of the result of the recursive call. This process continues until the input number `n` becomes 0, at which point the function returns the concatenated string representation of all the remainders in reverse order.

For example, when the function is called with `decimal_to_binary(8)`, it will first divide 8 by 2 to get 4 and append the remainder 0 to the left of the string "1". Then, it will divide 4 by 2 to get 2 and append the remainder 0 to the left of the string "10". Finally, it will divide 2 by 2 to get 1 and append the remainder 1 to the left of the string "100". The resulting binary representation of 8 is "1000", which is returned by the function.

The time complexity of this function is O(log(n)), where n is the input number. This is because the function performs at most log(n) divisions to convert the input number to binary. The space complexity is O(log(n)) as well, as the maximum length of the binary string representation of n is log(n).

Overall, this function provides a concise and efficient solution to convert a decimal number to its binary equivalent as a string with no leading zeros.
