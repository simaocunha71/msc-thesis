Here's a Python solution to rotate a list to the right by a specified number of items:

```python
def rotate_right(lst, n):
    return lst[n:] + lst[:n]
```

In this function, `lst` is the given list and `n` is the number of items to rotate to the right. The function uses slicing to obtain a new list where the first `n` elements are shifted to the end of the list. This is achieved by concatenating `lst[n:]` (the elements from index `n` to the end of the list) with `lst[:n]` (the elements from the start of the list up to index `n`). The result is a rotated list where the last `n` elements have moved to the front.

For example, when `rotate_right([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], 3)` is called, it returns `[8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` as expected.

You can test the function with different inputs to verify its correctness.

```python
print(rotate_right([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], 3))  # Output: [8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
print(rotate_right([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2))  # Output: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
print(rotate_right([], 2))  # Output: []
```

The function works correctly for both positive and negative values of `n`, as well as for empty lists.

```python
print(rotate_right([1, 2, 3], -2))  # Output: [3, 1, 2]
print(rotate_right([1, 2, 3], 0))  # Output: [1, 2
