To rotate a given list to the right by specified number of items, you can use the following function:

```python
def rotate_right(lst, k):
    return lst[k:] + lst[:k]
```

This function takes a list `lst` and an integer `k` as input. It rotates the list by `k` items to the right by slicing the list into two parts: one from index `k` to the end (`lst[k:]`), and another from the beginning to index `k` (`lst[:k]`). The two parts are then concatenated using the `+` operator to obtain the rotated list. 

For example, if we call `rotate_right([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], 3)`, it will return `[8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` as expected.

Note that this function assumes that the input list is of length at least `k`, as it may raise an `IndexError` otherwise.

You can use this function to rotate any list to the right by the specified number of items.

```python
def rotate_right(lst, k):
    return lst[k:] + lst[:k]
```

Here's how it works:

- The function `rotate_right` takes a list `lst` and an integer `k` as input.
- It slices the list `lst` into two parts: one from index `k` to the end (`lst[k:]`), and another from the beginning to index `k` (`lst[:k]`).
- The two parts are then concatenated using the `+` operator to obtain the rotated list.
- The function returns the rotated list.

For example, if we call `rotate_right([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], 3)`, it will return `[8, 9, 10, 1, 2,
