```
def rear_extract(lst):
    return [i[2] for i in lst]
```

Explanation:
To solve this problem we can use list comprehension to iterate over the tuples in the list and extract the last element of each tuple. Here's how it works:

1. The function `rear_extract` takes in a list of tuples as the parameter `lst`.
2. Inside the function, we use list comprehension to iterate over each tuple in the list. For each tuple `i`, we extract the third element (which is the rear element) using `i[2]`.
3. The extracted rear elements are collected in a new list, which is returned as the result of the function.
4. The assert statement at the end of the code checks whether the `rear_extract` function returns the expected result for the given input `[(1, 'Rash', 21), (2, 'Varsha', 20), (3, 'Kil', 19)]`. The expected output is `[21, 20, 19]`, and the assertion passes if the actual output matches the expected output.

By following this approach, the `rear_extract` function successfully extracts and returns the rear elements of each tuple in the input list.

Note: The indexing of elements in a tuple starts from 0, so `i[2]` refers to the third element of the tuple, which is the rear element.

Here's an example usage of the `rear_extract` function:

```python
input_list = [(1, 'Rash', 21), (2, 'Varsha', 20), (3, 'Kil', 19)]
result = rear_extract(input_list)
print(result)  # Output: [21, 20, 19]
```

In this example, we pass the `input_list` to the `rear_extract` function and store the result in the `result` variable. Finally, we print the `result`, which gives us the expected output `[21, 20, 19]`.

Overall, the `rear_extract` function provides a concise and efficient solution
