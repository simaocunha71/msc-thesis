```python
def rear_extract(list_tuples):
    return [i[2] for i in list_tuples]
```

Explanation:
This function uses list comprehension to iterate over the input list of tuples, and extracts the rear element of each tuple. The rear element of a tuple can be accessed using the index [2]. The function then returns the extracted elements as a new list.

In the given assertion, the function is tested with the input `[(1, 'Rash', 21), (2, 'Varsha', 20), (3, 'Kil', 19)]`, and it correctly returns `[21, 20, 19]`.

You can use this function to extract the rear elements of tuples in a list.

```python
# Example usage:
my_list = [(1, 'Rash', 21), (2, 'Varsha', 20), (3, 'Kil', 19)]
result = rear_extract(my_list)
print(result)  # Output: [21, 20, 19]
```

This code demonstrates how to use the `rear_extract` function to extract the rear elements of tuples from a list. The extracted elements are stored in the `result` variable and then printed to the console.

The function `rear_extract` is flexible and can be used with any list of tuples, as long as the tuples have at least three elements.

Note: The indexing in Python starts from 0, so the rear element of a tuple can be accessed using the index [2]. In the given code, `i[2]` is used to access the rear element of each tuple in the input list.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.
