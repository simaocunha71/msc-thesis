"""
The function check_K is used to check if the given tuples contain the k or not. It returns True if k is in the tuple and False if k is not in the tuple. The assertions are used to test the function check_K with the given tuple and k value. The function check_K should return True when k is in the tuple and False when k is not in the tuple.
