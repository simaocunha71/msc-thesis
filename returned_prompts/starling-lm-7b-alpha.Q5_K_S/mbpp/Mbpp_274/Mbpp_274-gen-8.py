"""
The above code defines a function called binomial_coeff that calculates the binomial coefficient using the combination formula. It also defines a function called even_binomial_coeff_Sum that calculates the sum of even index coefficients using the binomial coefficients. The function even_binomial_coeff_Sum takes a positive integer n as input and returns the sum of even index binomial coefficients for n. The assert statement verifies that the function correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for the given example of n = 4, which is 8.
