# Explanation
# This problem can be solved with a recursive approach. We know that the nth even index binomial coefficient is given by (2 ** (n-1)). To find the sum of all even index binomial coefficients, we can simply add up all the (2 ** (n-1)) values. This can be implemented using a recursive function that returns the sum of all even index binomial coefficients up to the nth coefficient. The base cases are when n is 0 or 1, where the sum is 0 or 1 respectively. For all other cases, the function returns (2 ** (n-1)) + even_binomial_Coeff_Sum(n-1). This means that for each coefficient, we add the current coefficient to the sum of all even index coefficients up to the previous coefficient. The function can be tested with the given assertion, which checks that the function returns 8 when passed the value 4.
