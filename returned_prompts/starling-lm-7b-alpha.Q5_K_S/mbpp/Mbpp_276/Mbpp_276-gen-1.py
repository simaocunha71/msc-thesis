Cylinder volume can be calculated by multiplying the area of the base (pi*r^2) with the height of the cylinder. Here's a function that accomplishes this:

```python
import math

def volume_cylinder(r, h):
    """
    Calculate the volume of a cylinder
    """
    return math.pi * r ** 2 * h
```

You can test the function with the provided assertion to verify its correctness.

```python
assert math.isclose(volume_cylinder(10, 5), 1570.7500000000002, rel_tol=0.001)
```

The `math.isclose()` function is used to compare two floating point numbers with a tolerance. It returns True if the two numbers are approximately equal, and False otherwise. The `rel_tol` parameter specifies the relative tolerance, which is the maximum allowed difference between the two numbers divided by the first number. In this case, a relative tolerance of 0.001 is used, which means that the two numbers are considered approximately equal if their difference is at most 0.001 times the first number.

The `**` operator is used to calculate the square of a number, which is necessary for the area of the base of the cylinder. The `math.pi` constant is used to represent the value of pi, which is approximately equal to 3.14159265359.

Overall, this function correctly calculates the volume of a cylinder based on the provided radius and height, and the assertion verifies that the calculated volume is approximately equal to the expected volume within the specified tolerance.

```python
# Testing the function
r = 10
h = 5
volume = volume_cylinder(r, h)
expected_volume = 1570.7500000000002
print(f"The calculated volume is {volume}")
print(f"The expected volume is {expected_volume}")
print(math.isclose(volume, expected_volume, rel_tol=0.001))
```
