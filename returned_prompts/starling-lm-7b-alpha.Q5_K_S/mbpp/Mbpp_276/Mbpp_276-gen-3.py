C:
```
import math

def volume_cylinder(radius, height):
    return math.pi * radius ** 2 * height
```

Here's a function that calculates the volume of a cylinder. It takes the radius and height as parameters and uses the formula `pi * radius * radius * height` to calculate the volume. The function `math.isclose()` is used to compare the calculated volume with the expected volume to check if the function is correct. The `rel_tol` parameter is set to 0.001, which means the two values are considered equal if their absolute difference is less than or equal to 0.001 times the value of the expected volume.

To use the function, you can simply call it with the desired radius and height as arguments. For example, `volume_cylinder(10, 5)` will return the volume of a cylinder with a radius of 10 and a height of 5.
```

Here's an example of how to use the `volume_cylinder()` function:

```python
import math

def volume_cylinder(radius, height):
    return math.pi * radius ** 2 * height

# Test the function
assert math.isclose(volume_cylinder(10, 5), 1570.7500000000002, rel_tol=0.001)
```

In this example, the function is tested by asserting that the calculated volume of a cylinder with a radius of 10 and a height of 5 is approximately equal to 1570.7500000000002, with a relative tolerance of 0.001. The `math.isclose()` function is used to compare the calculated volume with the expected volume and check if they are approximately equal within the specified tolerance.

By using this function, you can easily calculate the volume of a cylinder with any given radius and height.

```

The `math.isclose()` function is a built-in Python function that checks if two numbers are approximately equal within a specified tolerance. It takes three arguments: the first number to compare, the second number
