def volume_cylinder(r, h):
    return pi * r * r * h
```

Explanation:
To calculate the volume of a cylinder, we can use the formula V = pi * r * r * h, where r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder. In this code, we define a function called `volume_cylinder` that takes in the radius (r) and height (h) as parameters. The function then calculates and returns the volume of the cylinder using the given formula. The `math.pi` constant is used to calculate the value of pi, and the `math.isclose` function is used to check the accuracy of the calculated volume.

To use the `volume_cylinder` function, you can simply pass in the desired radius and height values as arguments, and the function will return the volume of the cylinder. For example, `volume_cylinder(10, 5)` will return approximately 1570.75 as the volume of the cylinder with a radius of 10 and a height of 5.

The `assert math.isclose(volume_cylinder(10,5), 1570.7500000000002, rel_tol=0.001)` statement is used to verify the accuracy of the `volume_cylinder` function. The `math.isclose` function checks if the calculated volume is close to the expected value (1570.75) within a relative tolerance of 0.001. If the condition is satisfied, the assertion will pass and the function is considered to be accurate.

Overall, this code provides a convenient way to calculate the volume of a cylinder using the `volume_cylinder` function and ensures its accuracy through the use of the `math.isclose` function.

Note: The use of `math.isclose` with a relative tolerance of 0.001 ensures that the calculated volume is accurate within the desired level of precision.
