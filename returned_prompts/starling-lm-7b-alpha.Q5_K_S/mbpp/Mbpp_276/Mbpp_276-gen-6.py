Here's one way you might write the function:

```python
import math

def volume_cylinder(r, h):
    return math.pi * r ** 2 * h
```

The function takes in two parameters, `r` for the radius of the cylinder and `h` for the height. It uses the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is pi times the square of the radius times the height. The function then returns the calculated volume.

To test the function, the code uses the `assert` statement to check if the result of calling the `volume_cylinder` function with the arguments `(10, 5)` is approximately equal to `1570.7500000000002`, with a relative tolerance of `0.001`. This means that the calculated volume should be within a tolerance of `0.001` of the expected value.

The `math.isclose()` function is used to compare the two values, checking if they are approximately equal within the specified tolerance. If the assertion fails, it will raise an `AssertionError` with an explanatory error message.

Overall, this code tests the correctness of the `volume_cylinder` function by comparing its output with an expected value, ensuring that it accurately calculates the volume of a cylinder based on the given radius and height.

```python
import math

def volume_cylinder(r, h):
    return math.pi * r ** 2 * h
```

```python
assert math.isclose(volume_cylinder(10, 5), 1570.7500000000002, rel_tol=0.001)
```

The code tests the `volume_cylinder` function by checking if the volume of a cylinder with radius `10` and height `5` is approximately equal to `1570.7500000000002` within a tolerance of `0.001`. If the assertion fails, it will raise an `AssertionError` with an explanatory error message.

By using the `math.isclose()` function,
