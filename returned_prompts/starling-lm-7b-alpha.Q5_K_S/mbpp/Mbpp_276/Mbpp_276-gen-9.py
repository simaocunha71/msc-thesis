C:
```
import math
def volume_cylinder(radius, height):
    return math.pi*radius**2*height
```

Explanation:
The volume of a cylinder is calculated by multiplying the cross-sectional area of the base (pi*r^2) by the height. In this solution, the `volume_cylinder` function takes the radius and height of a cylinder as input parameters. It then calculates the cross-sectional area using the formula pi*r^2, and multiplies it by the height to obtain the volume. The result is returned as the output of the function. The `math.isclose` function is used to verify the correctness of the solution by comparing the calculated volume with the expected value of 1570.7500000000002, ensuring that the relative difference between the two values is less than 0.001 (rel_tol=0.001).

To use the solution, you can call the `volume_cylinder` function with the desired radius and height values. For example, `volume_cylinder(10,5)` will return the volume of a cylinder with a radius of 10 and a height of 5.

The provided assertion ensures that the `volume_cylinder` function is correct by comparing its output with the expected result. If the relative difference between the calculated and expected volumes is less than 0.001, the assertion passes, confirming the accuracy of the solution.

Overall, this solution provides a correct and efficient way to calculate the volume of a cylinder using the provided radius and height values.

Note: The `math.isclose` function is available in Python 3.5 and later versions. If you are using an older version of Python, you can use the `math.isclose` function from the `numpy` library or implement a custom function to compare the values with the desired relative tolerance.
