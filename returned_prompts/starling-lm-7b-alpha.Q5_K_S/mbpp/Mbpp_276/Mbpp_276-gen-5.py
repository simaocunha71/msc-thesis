Cylinder Volume = π * r^2 * h

Here's a Python function that calculates the volume of a cylinder:

```python
import math

def volume_cylinder(r, h):
    pi = math.pi
    return pi * (r ** 2) * h
```

To test the function, you can use the `math.isclose()` function to check if the result is approximately equal to the expected value. Here's an example of how to use it:

```python
assert math.isclose(volume_cylinder(10, 5), 1570.7500000000002, rel_tol=0.001)
```

This will assert that the calculated volume is within a relative tolerance of 0.001 of the expected value, which means it's a very close approximation.

In the function, `math.pi` is used to represent the value of pi, and the formula for the volume of a cylinder, `π * r^2 * h`, is applied. The result is returned as the volume of the cylinder.

By using `math.isclose()` with a relative tolerance of 0.001, you can ensure that the calculated volume is a very close approximation to the expected value.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. Import the `math` module to access the value of pi (π).
2. Define a function called `volume_cylinder` that takes in two parameters, `r` and `h`, representing the radius and height of the cylinder, respectively.
3. Inside the function, assign the value of pi to a variable called `pi`.
4. Use the formula for the volume of a cylinder, `π * r^2 * h`, and return the result.
5. Test the function by asserting that the calculated volume is within a relative tolerance of 0.001 of the expected value using `math.isclose()`.

By following these steps, you can create a function that calculates the volume of a cylinder and verify that it produces accurate results.

```python
import math

def volume_cylinder(r,
