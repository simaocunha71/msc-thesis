Cylinder volume formula: pi * r^2 * h

```python
import math

def volume_cylinder(r, h):
    pi = math.pi
    return pi * (r ** 2) * h
```

Explanation:

To calculate the volume of a cylinder, we need to use the cylinder volume formula, which is pi * r^2 * h, where r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder. 

The function `volume_cylinder` takes in two parameters, `r` and `h`, representing the radius and height of the cylinder respectively. It uses the `math.pi` constant to calculate the value of pi, and then multiplies it with `r ** 2` and `h` to find the volume of the cylinder.

The assert statement at the end of the code checks if the result of the `volume_cylinder` function with the given radius and height (10 and 5) is approximately equal to 1570.7500000000002, with a relative tolerance of 0.001. This means that the result should be within 0.001 of 1570.7500000000002 for the test case to pass.

In Python, the `math.isclose` function is used to check if two numbers are approximately equal, with a specified relative tolerance. It returns `True` if the two numbers are within the tolerance of each other, and `False` otherwise.

Overall, the code calculates the volume of a cylinder using the given radius and height, and checks if the result is within the specified tolerance of the expected value.

```python
import math

def volume_cylinder(r, h):
    pi = math.pi
    return pi * (r ** 2) * h
```

```python
assert math.isclose(volume_cylinder(10,5), 1570.7500000000002, rel_tol=0.001)
```

```python
# Expected output: True
```
