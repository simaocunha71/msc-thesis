# Code Explanation
# The function `extract_rear` takes a tuple `t` as input. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element in the tuple and extracts the rear index element (i.e., the last character) of each string. The extracted elements are then returned as a list.

# The provided `assert` statement checks if the function `extract_rear` correctly returns `['s', 'r', 's']` when given the tuple `('Mers', 'for', 'Vers')`. This ensures that the function is working as expected.

# By using the `[-1]` index notation, we can access the last character of each string in the tuple. The list comprehension `[i[-1] for i in t]` iterates over each element `i` in the tuple `t` and appends the last character of `i` to the resulting list. Finally, the function returns this list containing the rear index elements of each string in the tuple.

# Note: The provided solution assumes that the input tuple `t` only contains strings, and not other types of elements (e.g., integers, lists, etc.). If the input tuple can contain other types of elements, additional logic would be needed to handle those cases.

# Example usage:
# extract_rear(('Mers', 'for', 'Vers'))  # Returns: ['s', 'r', 's']
# extract_rear(('Hello', 'World', 'StackOverflow'))  # Returns: ['o', 'd', 'o']
# extract_rear(('123', 'ABC', 'XYZ'))  # Raises a TypeError, as the input contains non-string elements.

# To handle non-string elements, you can modify the function to check if each element in the tuple is a string before accessing the rear index. Here's an updated version of the function that includes this check:

# def extract_rear(t):
#     return [i[-1] for i in t if isinstance(i, str)]

# With this modification, the function will only process elements in the tuple that are strings, and ignore any non-string elements
