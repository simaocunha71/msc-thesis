Here's a step-by-step guide to solve this problem:

1. Define a function named `extract_rear` that takes a tuple as an argument.
2. Initialize an empty list called `result`.
3. Use a for loop to iterate over each string in the tuple.
4. For each string, use the `[]` syntax to index the last character, and append it to the `result` list.
5. After the loop, return the `result` list.
6. Write a test case to verify the correctness of the function.

Here is the Python code that implements the steps above:

```python
def extract_rear(tup):
    result = []
    for s in tup:
        result.append(s[-1])
    return result

assert extract_rear(('Mers', 'for', 'Vers')) == ['s', 'r', 's']
```

By following these steps, you can create a function that takes a tuple as input and returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple.

```python
def extract_rear(tup):
    result = []
    for s in tup:
        result.append(s[-1])
    return result
```

To use the function, you can call it with a tuple as an argument, like this:

```python
print(extract_rear(('Mers', 'for', 'Vers')))  # Output: ['s', 'r', 's']
```

The function will extract the rear index element of each string in the tuple and return a list with the results.

```python
assert extract_rear(('Mers', 'for', 'Vers')) == ['s', 'r', 's']
```

This assertion verifies that the function is working correctly and producing the expected output.

```python
def extract_rear(tup):
    result = []
    for s in tup:
        result.append(s[-1])
    return result
```

In this Python code, the `extract_rear` function takes a tuple `tup` as input. It initializes an empty list `result` to store the rear index
