def extract_rear(t):
    return [s[-1] for s in t]


# Assertion
assert extract_rear(('Mers', 'for', 'Vers')) == ['s', 'r', 's']









"""
Explanation:
The function extract_rear(t) takes a tuple of strings as an input and uses a list comprehension to extract the rear index element of each string.
The list comprehension [s[-1] for s in t] iterates over each string s in the tuple t and extracts the rear index element using the indexing operator -1.
The extracted rear index elements are collected into a new list which is then returned as the output of the function.
In the given assertion, extract_rear(('Mers', 'for', 'Vers')) is called with the tuple ('Mers', 'for', 'Vers') as an argument.
The expected output is ['s', 'r', 's'], which matches the actual output of the function, so the assertion passes.
