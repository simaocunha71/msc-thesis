def bell_Number(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    if n == 1 or n == 2:
        return n
    else:
        return bell_Number(n-1) + bell_Number(n-2) + bell_Number(n-3)

# To test the above function
assert bell_Number(2) == 2

# The above code will return True if the function is correct and False otherwise.

The Bell numbers are the coefficients in the Bell polynomial, which counts the number of ways to partition a set. The first few Bell numbers are 1, 2, 5, 15, 52, 203, â€¦ . They can be computed using the Bell triangle, which is constructed by adding each number to the three above it.

Here is a Python function that computes the nth Bell number:

```python
def bell_number(n):
    """
    Compute the nth Bell number.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        The index of the Bell number to compute.

    Returns
    -------
    int
        The nth Bell number.
    """
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    if n == 1 or n == 2:
        return n
    else:
        return bell_number(n-1) + bell_number(n-2) + bell_number(n-3)
```

This function uses a recursive definition of the Bell numbers. The base cases are for n=0, n=1, and n=2, where the Bell numbers are 1, 2, and 5, respectively. For larger values of n, the function recursively calls itself with n-1, n-2, and n-3, and adds the results. The recursion continues until it reaches one of the base cases.

To verify the correctness of the function, you can use the `assert` statement to check if the function returns the correct Bell number for a small input. For example, you can use the assertion `assert bell_number(2) == 2` to check if the function correctly computes the second Bell number, which is 2
