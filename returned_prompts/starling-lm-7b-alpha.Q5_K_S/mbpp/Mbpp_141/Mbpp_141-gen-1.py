Explanation:
The `pancake_sort` function takes a list of elements as input and uses the pancake sort algorithm to sort the list in ascending order. The algorithm works by repeatedly finding the maximum element in the list and swapping it with the first element of the list. This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted. The `max_elem` variable stores the maximum element in the current iteration, and the `max_index` variable stores its index in the list. The `remove` method is used to remove the maximum element from the list, and the `insert` method is used to insert the maximum element at the beginning of the list. Finally, the `del` statement is used to remove the element at the `max_index + 1` position from the list. The function returns the sorted list.

The assertion `assert pancake_sort([15, 79, 25, 38, 69]) == [15, 25, 38, 69, 79]` checks if the `pancake_sort` function correctly sorts the input list `[15, 79, 25, 38, 69]` to the expected output `[15, 25, 38, 69, 79]`.

Overall, the provided solution implements the pancake sort algorithm in Python to sort a given list of elements.

```python
def pancake_sort(lst):
    """Sort a list of elements using pancake sort."""
    while lst:
        max_elem = max(lst)
        max_index = lst.index(max_elem)
        lst.remove(max_elem)
        lst.insert(0, max_elem)
        del lst[
