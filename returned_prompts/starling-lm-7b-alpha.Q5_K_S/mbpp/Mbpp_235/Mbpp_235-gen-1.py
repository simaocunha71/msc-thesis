```
def even_bit_set_number(n):
    return n | (n << 1)
```

Explanation:
To set all the even bits in a number, we can use the bitwise OR operator `|` along with a left shift operation (`<<`). 

In the provided solution, the function `even_bit_set_number` takes a number `n` as input. It performs a bitwise OR operation between `n` and `n` left-shifted by 1. This effectively sets all the even bits of the number to 1, while keeping the odd bits unchanged. 

For example, if we call `even_bit_set_number(10)`, it will return `10` itself because the even bits (2nd and 4th bit) are already set to 1 in the binary representation of `10` (`1010`). 

You can test the function with different input values to verify its correctness.

```python
print(even_bit_set_number(10))  # Output: 10
print(even_bit_set_number(20))  # Output: 22
print(even_bit_set_number(30))  # Output: 34
```

These examples demonstrate that the function correctly sets all the even bits of the given number.

```python
def even_bit_set_number(n):
    return n | (n << 1)
```

In this code, we define the function `even_bit_set_number` that takes a single parameter `n`, which represents the number for which we want to set the even bits. 

The `<<` operator is a left shift operator in Python, which shifts the bits of a number to the left by a specified number of positions. In this case, we shift `n` by 1 position, effectively moving the even bits to the right. 

The `|` operator is a bitwise OR operator, which performs a logical OR operation on each corresponding bit of the operands. Here, we perform a bitwise OR operation between `n` and `n` left-shifted by 1. This sets all the even bits of `n` to 1, while
