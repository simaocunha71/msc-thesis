# Explanation

In this problem, we are asked to set all the even bits of a given number. The even bits are the bits at positions 2, 4, 6, 8, and so on. To set a bit, we can use the bitwise OR operator (`|`). 

The function `even_bit_set_number` takes a number `n` as input and returns the result of bitwise OR operation between `n` and `n` left-shifted by 1. 

In the bitwise OR operation, if a bit in the first operand is 1 and the corresponding bit in the second operand is also 1, the result will be 1. Otherwise, the result will be 0. 

By left-shifting `n` by 1, we are moving all the bits one position to the left, effectively shifting all the even bits to the left by one position. Then, the bitwise OR operation is performed between `n` and the left-shifted `n`, which sets all the even bits of `n` to 1. 

The function `even_bit_set_number` can be tested using the `assert` statement. In this case, we are asserting that the function returns the same value as the input number `n`, which means that no even bits are set in the number. 

Overall, the function `even_bit_set_number` sets all the even bits of a given number to 1, while leaving the odd bits unchanged.
