To test the implementation, you can use the following code:

```python
def test_comb_sort():
    assert comb_sort([5, 15, 37, 25, 79]) == [5, 15, 25, 37, 79]

test_comb_sort()
```

This will run the `test_comb_sort()` function and print `None` if the test passes or an error message if the test fails.

The `comb_sort()` function implements the comb sort algorithm, which is a variation of the bubble sort algorithm. It uses a gap variable to determine the number of elements to compare and swap at each iteration. The gap is initially set to the length of the list, and the algorithm continues until the gap becomes zero or no swaps are made during an iteration.

The algorithm starts by setting the sorting flag to True and the gap to the length of the list. It then enters a while loop that continues until the sorting flag is False. Inside the loop, the gap is updated by multiplying it by 10 and dividing it by 13. This ensures that the gap decreases exponentially. Then, a for loop is used to iterate over the elements of the list, comparing and swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. If any swaps are made, the sorting flag
