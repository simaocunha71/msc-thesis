The code you provided is an assert statement, which is used to check if a condition is true. In this case, the condition is checking if the `issort_list` function returns `True` when passed the list `[1,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,17]`.

To implement the `issort_list` function, you can use the built-in `sorted` function in Python. The `sorted` function returns a new sorted version of a list, without modifying the original list. By comparing the original list with the sorted version of the list, you can determine if the list is sorted or not.

Here's an example implementation of the `issort_list` function:

```python
def issort_list(lst):
    return lst == sorted(lst)
```

The `issort_list` function takes a list as an argument and returns `True` if the list is sorted in ascending order, and `False` otherwise.

To test the function, you can use the `assert` statement as shown in the provided code snippet:

```python
assert issort_list([1,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,17])==True
```

This assertion will check if the `issort_list` function correctly identifies the specified list as sorted and returns `True`. If the assertion fails, an error will be raised.

You can add more test cases to the `issort_list` function to cover various scenarios and ensure its correctness.

Overall, the code you provided is a way to test the `issort_list` function by asserting that it correctly identifies a sorted list.
