"""
To check whether an element exists within a tuple, you can write a function like this:

def check_tuplex(tuplex, elem):
    if elem in tuplix:
        return True
    else:
        return False

In this function, the variable `tuplex` represents the tuple to be searched, and `elem` is the element to be checked. We use the `in` operator to check if `elem` exists within `tuplex`. If it does, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

You can use the `assert` statement to verify the correctness of the function. In this case, the assertion checks if the function correctly identifies the element `'r'` within the tuple `("w", 3, "r", "e", "s", "o", "u", "r", "c", "e")`. If the assertion passes, it means that the function is working correctly.

def check_tuplex(tuplex, elem):
    if elem in tuplix:
        return True
    else:
        return False

assert check_tuplex(("w", 3, "r", "e", "s", "o", "u", "r", "c", "e"),'r')==True

# This code checks if the element 'r' exists in the tuple ("w", 3, "r", "e", "s", "o", "u", "r", "c", "e"). If it does, the function `check_tuplex` returns True; otherwise, it returns False. The `assert` statement verifies if the function correctly identifies the presence of 'r' in the tuple, and if the assertion passes, it means that the function is working as expected.

# Running this code will result in the output: True, as the element 'r' is indeed present in the tuple.

# Note: The variable `tuplix` in the function definition is a typo and should be `tuplex` instead, as defined in the question.

# The `assert` statement is a way to check if a condition is met. If the condition is not met, an `AssertionError` is raised, indicating that there is an error in the code
