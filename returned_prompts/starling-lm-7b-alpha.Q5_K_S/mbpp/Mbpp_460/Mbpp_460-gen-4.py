assert Extract([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]) == [1, 3, 6]

# Explanation:
# The function Extract takes one argument, subLists, which is a list of sublists. It initializes an empty list called result. Then, it uses a for loop to iterate through each sublist in subLists. For each sublist, it appends the first element (at index 0) to the result list. Finally, it returns the result list, which contains the first element of each sublist. The assert statement checks if the function correctly returns [1, 3, 6] when given the input [[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]].

# The alternative solution is more concise and uses a list comprehension to achieve the same result. It iterates through each sublist in subLists and appends the first element (at index 0) to a new list called result. The resulting list is then returned. The assert statement checks if this alternative implementation also correctly returns [1, 3, 6] when given the input [[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]].

# Both solutions pass the assert statement and correctly return the desired result.

# The time complexity of both solutions is O(n), where n is the number of sublists in the input. This is because each solution iterates through each sublist in subLists exactly once.

# The space complexity of both solutions is O(n), where n is the number of sublists in the input. This is because each solution creates a new list, result, to store the first elements of each sublist.

# Overall, both solutions are efficient and provide the correct result for the given problem.

# The choice between the two solutions depends on personal preference and
