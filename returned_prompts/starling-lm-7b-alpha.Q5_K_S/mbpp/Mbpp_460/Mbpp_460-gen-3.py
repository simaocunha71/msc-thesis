def Extract(list):

Explanation:
The provided Python function, Extract, takes a list of sublists as an argument and returns a new list that contains the first element of each sublist. This is achieved using a list comprehension, which iterates over the input list and selects the first element of each sublist. The function is tested with the given assertion, which checks if the returned list is equal to [1, 3, 6].

The solution correctly implements the desired functionality. It uses list comprehension to efficiently extract the first element from each sublist in the input list. The assertion verifies that the function works as expected by comparing the returned list with the expected result, which is [1, 3, 6].

Here's an example usage of the Extract function:
