```
def Extract(lst):
    return [x[0] for x in lst]
```

Explanation:
The function `Extract` is defined to take a list of lists as an input. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list and extract the first element of each sublist. The resulting list of first elements is then returned as the output.

In the provided assert statement, the function `Extract` is tested with the input `[[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]`. The expected output is `[1, 3, 6]`, which matches the output of the function when called with this input.

Overall, the `Extract` function is a useful tool for extracting the first element of each sublist in a given list of lists, and the provided assert statement demonstrates its correctness.

Note: It's important to note that the `Extract` function assumes that the input list is not empty and contains at least one sublist. If the input list could be empty or contain no sublists, additional error handling would be necessary to prevent an error from occurring when trying to access the first element of an empty sublist.

To improve the robustness of the `Extract` function, you can add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure that the input list is not empty and contains at least one sublist. Here's an updated version of the function with this check:

```python
def Extract(lst):
    if not lst:  # Check if the input list is empty
        raise ValueError("Input list cannot be empty.")
    return [x[0] for x in lst if x]  # Use a conditional list comprehension to filter out empty sublists
```

With this modification, the `Extract` function will raise a `ValueError` if the input list is empty or contains no sublists, providing a clearer error message and preventing unexpected behavior.

In conclusion, the `Extract` function is a useful tool for extracting the first element of each sublist in a given list of lists. By adding a check for empty input lists, the function can be made more robust and provide clearer error handling.
