Here is one way you can define the function:

```python
def Extract(lst):
    return [lst[0]]
```

However, this function will only return the first element of the first sublist, not the first element of each sublist.

To solve the problem correctly, you can use list comprehension to iterate over the sublists and return the first element from each. Here's the corrected function:

```python
def Extract(lst):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in lst]
```

Now, when you call `Extract([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]])`, you will get the expected result `[1, 3, 6]`.

To verify the function works correctly, you can use the `assert` statement to check if the returned result matches the expected result. Here's an example:

```python
def test_Extract():
    assert Extract([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]) == [1, 3, 6]

test_Extract()
```

If the assert statement doesn't raise an `AssertionError`, it means the `Extract` function is working correctly.

```python
def Extract(lst):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in lst]
```

You can use this function to get the first element of each sublist in a nested list.

```python
Extract([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]])  # returns [1, 3, 6]
```

This function is efficient and easy to understand, making it a good solution for this problem.

```python
def test_Extract():
    assert Extract([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]) == [1, 3, 6]

test_Extract()
```

By using the `assert` statement, you can verify that the `Extract` function is working
