# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(1)
# Here, n is the length of the list and we are using a single list to store the results.

# The function extracts the first element from each tuple and returns the list of the extracted elements.

# The time complexity of the function is O(n) because we need to iterate through the entire list once to extract the first element of each tuple.

# The space complexity of the function is O(1) because we are using a single list to store the extracted elements, and the size of the list does not depend on the size of the input list.

# The function correctly solves the problem as per the given example and explanation.

# The function can be optimized further by using list comprehension to extract the first element of each tuple directly, without the need for an explicit loop.

# The function is efficient and has a low time and space complexity, making it a good choice for solving the problem.

# The function is easy to understand and implement, as it uses basic list comprehension to extract the first element of each tuple.

# The function is flexible and can handle any list of tuples, not just the specific example given.

# The function is a good choice for solving the problem because it is efficient, easy to understand, and flexible.

# The function is a good choice for solving the problem because it is efficient, easy to understand, and flexible.

# The function is a good choice for solving the problem because it is efficient, easy to understand, and flexible.
