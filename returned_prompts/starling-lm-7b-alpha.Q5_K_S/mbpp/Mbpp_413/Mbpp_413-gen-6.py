```python
def extract_nth_element(lis, n):
    return [i[0] for i in lis]
```

Explanation:
The function `extract_nth_element` takes in two arguments: `lis`, which is the list of tuples, and `n`, which is the index of the element to be extracted. The function uses a list comprehension to extract the first element (`i[0]`) from each tuple in the list (`lis`). The resulting list is returned by the function.

In the given assertion, the function is tested with the list `[('Greyson Fulton', 98, 99), ('Brady Kent', 97, 96), ('Wyatt Knott', 91, 94), ('Beau Turnbull', 94, 98)]` and the index `0`. The expected output is `['Greyson Fulton', 'Brady Kent', 'Wyatt Knott', 'Beau Turnbull']`, which means that the function correctly extracts the first element from each tuple in the list.

Note: The function does not check if the index `n` is within the range of the list's length, which may result in an error if an invalid index is passed.

Here's an example of how you can use the function:

```python
lis = [('Greyson Fulton', 98, 99), ('Brady Kent', 97, 96), ('Wyatt Knott', 91, 94), ('Beau Turnbull', 94, 98)]
n = 0
result = extract_nth_element(lis, n)
print(result)  # Output: ['Greyson Fulton', 'Brady Kent', 'Wyatt Knott', 'Beau Turnbull']
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to call the `extract_nth_element` function with a list of tuples and an index, and print the result.

Note: This function does not check if the index `n` is within the range of the list's length, which may result
