def extract_nth_element(tup_list, n):
    # Extract the nth element from each tuple in the list
    extracted_list = [tup[n] for tup in tup_list]
    return extracted_list

# Test
print(extract_nth_element([('Greyson Fulton', 98, 99), ('Brady Kent', 97, 96), ('Wyatt Knott', 91, 94), ('Beau Turnbull', 94, 98)], 0))  # ['Greyson Fulton', 'Brady Kent', 'Wyatt Knott', 'Beau Turnbull']

# Time complexity: O(N), N is the size of tuple list
# Space complexity: O(1), no additional space is needed except a result array

# The function works by using list comprehension to extract the nth element from each tuple in the list.
# It then returns the extracted list. The time complexity is O(N) as it needs to process each tuple in the list,
# and the space complexity is O(1) as it only requires a result array to store the extracted elements, which does not grow with the size of the input.
