To get the difference between two lists in Python, you can use the built-in set data structure, which stores unique elements. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Define your function: In this case, it's called `Diff`. This function takes two lists as input.

2. Convert the two lists to sets: Since sets only store unique values, converting the lists to sets will eliminate duplicate values. This is important because the `-` operator requires the operands to be the same type.

3. Subtract the second set from the first set: Python's `-` operator can be used to find the difference between two sets. It returns a new set that contains the elements in the first set but not in the second set.

4. Convert the result back to a list: Since the `-` operator returns a set, you need to convert the result back to a list to match the expected output format.

Here's the code that implements these steps:

```python
def Diff(list1, list2):
    return list(set(list1) - set(list2))
```

To test the function, you can use the `assert` statement to check if the function's output matches the expected result. For example:

```python
assert Diff([10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40], [25, 40, 35]) == [10, 20, 30, 15]
```

This assertion will pass if the function correctly calculates the difference between the two lists.

Note that this approach will work correctly even if the lists contain duplicate values. For example, if one of the lists is `[10, 10, 15, 20, 35, 35, 40]`, the function will correctly return `[25, 40, 30, 15]`.

However, if you expect the lists to be sorted and want to optimize the function for this case, you can use the `bisect` module to achieve better performance. Here's an alternative implementation using `bisect`:

```python
import bisect

def Diff(list1
