Correct Solution:
"""
def Diff(l1,l2):
    return list(set(l1)-set(l2))

assert Diff([10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40], [25, 40, 35]) == [10, 20, 30, 15]
"""

The above code will not work as expected, because set() will return unique elements, and as a result, the difference between two lists will not be correctly calculated. Here's a correct solution:

```python
def Diff(l1,l2):
    return list(set(l1) - set(l2))
```
This code will correctly calculate the difference between two lists, and the assert statement will pass.

Note: The set() function in Python returns an unordered collection of unique elements. The - operator is used to get the difference between two sets.
```python
diff_list = list(set(l1) - set(l2))
```
This line of code creates a new list by removing the common elements between l1 and l2, and retaining only the unique elements from l1. The resulting list is assigned to the variable diff_list.

Finally, the assert statement is used to verify if the Diff() function is correctly calculating the difference between two lists. If the assert statement passes, it means that the function is working correctly.
```python
assert Diff([10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40], [25, 40, 35]) == [10, 20, 30, 15]
```
This assert statement checks if the Diff() function, when given the input lists [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40] and [25, 40, 35], returns the expected output [10, 20, 30, 15]. If the assert statement passes
