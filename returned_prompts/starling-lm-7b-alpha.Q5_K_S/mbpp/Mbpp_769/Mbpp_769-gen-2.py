Here's a Python function that calculates the difference between two lists:

```python
def Diff(list1, list2):
    return [i for i in list1 if i not in list2]
```

This function uses a list comprehension to create a new list that contains all elements from `list1` that are not in `list2`. The `not in` operator is used to check if an element from `list1` is not present in `list2`.

To test the function with your example, you can use the following code:

```python
assert Diff([10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40], [25, 40, 35]) == [10, 20, 30, 15]
```

This assertion will pass if the function correctly calculates the difference between the two lists, as specified in your question.
