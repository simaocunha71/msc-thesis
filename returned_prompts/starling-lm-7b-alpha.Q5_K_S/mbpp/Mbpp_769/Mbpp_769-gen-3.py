Here's a Python function that calculates the difference between two lists:

```python
def Diff(list1, list2):
    list1_set = set(list1)
    list2_set = set(list2)
    difference = list1_set.difference(list2_set)
    return list(difference)
```

To test the function, we can use the `assert` statement to verify the output:

```python
assert Diff([10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40], [25, 40, 35]) == [10, 20, 30, 15]
```

This function works by converting both lists into sets, which automatically removes duplicate elements. Then, the `difference` method is used to find the elements that are in `list1_set` but not in `list2_set`. Finally, the `list` function is used to convert the set back into a list, which is then returned as the result.

By using sets and the `difference` method, this function efficiently calculates the difference between two lists, removing any duplicate elements in the process.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.
