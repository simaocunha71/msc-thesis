```
def find_dissimilar(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(set(tup1) - set(tup2))
```

Explanation:
This function uses set operations to find the dissimilar elements in the given two tuples. The `set()` function is used to convert the tuples to sets, and the `-` operator is used to find the set difference, which gives the elements that are in the first set but not in the second set. Finally, the `tuple()` function is used to convert the set of dissimilar elements back to a tuple, and this is returned as the result.

In the example provided, the function is called with the tuples `(3, 4, 5, 6)` and `(5, 7, 4, 10)`. The set difference between these two sets is `{3, 6, 7, 10}`, so the function returns the tuple `(3, 6, 7, 10)`, which is the expected result.

This solution works correctly for any two tuples with unique elements, as long as the elements are all of hashable types (i.e., immutable types, such as integers, floats, and strings). If the tuples contain non-hashable types, or if they contain duplicate elements, the function may not produce the expected result.

To use this solution in your own code, simply replace `tup1` and `tup2` with the tuples you want to compare. The function will return a tuple of the dissimilar elements, which you can then use as needed.

Overall, this solution provides a simple and efficient way to find the dissimilar elements in two tuples, using built-in Python functions and operations.
