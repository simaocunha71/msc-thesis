```
def find_dissimilar(t1, t2):
    return tuple(set(t1) - set(t2))
```

Explanation:
Here, the function `find_dissimilar` takes two tuples, `t1` and `t2`, as input.
It first converts both tuples into sets using the built-in `set()` function.
Then, it uses the set's `-` operator to find the difference between the two sets, which gives us the dissimilar elements.
Finally, the function converts the resulting set back into a tuple using the built-in `tuple()` function, and returns the tuple of dissimilar elements.

To test the function, we can use the `assert` statement to check if the function returns the expected result when given the example inputs `(3, 4, 5, 6)` and `(5, 7, 4, 10)`.

The expected output of the function for this example is `(3, 6, 7, 10)`, which represents the dissimilar elements between the two tuples.

By using the `set()` function and set operations, we can efficiently find the dissimilar elements in the given two tuples.

In the provided solution, the `find_dissimilar` function is defined to take two tuple arguments, `t1` and `t2`. It first converts both tuples into sets using the `set()` function. Then, it uses the set's `-` operator to find the difference between the two sets, which gives us the dissimilar elements. Finally, it converts the resulting set back into a tuple using the `tuple()` function and returns the tuple of dissimilar elements.
