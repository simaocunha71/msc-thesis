"""
To solve this problem, we can create a function named `find_dissimilar` that takes two tuples as input. Inside the function, we can convert the tuples into sets using the `set()` function. Sets are collections of unique elements, so converting the tuples into sets will remove all duplicate elements. Next, we can use the `difference()` method to find the elements that are present in the first set but not in the second set. Finally, we can convert the result back into a tuple using the `tuple()` function and return it.

Here's the code for the `find_dissimilar` function:

```python
def find_dissimilar(tuple1, tuple2):
    set1 = set(tuple1)
    set2 = set(tuple2)
    result = tuple(set1.difference(set2))
    return result
```

To test the function, you can use the provided assertion:

```python
assert find_dissimilar((3, 4, 5, 6), (5, 7, 4, 10)) == (3, 6, 7, 10)
```

This assertion checks if the `find_dissimilar` function correctly finds the dissimilar elements in the given two tuples and returns them as a tuple.

def find_dissimilar(tuple1, tuple2):
    set1 = set(tuple1)
    set2 = set(tuple2)
    result = tuple(set1.difference(set2))
    return result

assert find_dissimilar((3, 4, 5, 6), (5, 7, 4, 10)) == (3, 6, 7, 10)
```

In this solution, we first convert the given tuples into sets using the `set()` function. Sets are collections of unique elements, so converting the tuples into sets will remove all duplicate elements. Next, we use the `difference()` method to find the elements that are present in the first set but not in the second set. Finally, we convert the result back into a tuple using the `tuple()` function and return it.
