```
def union_elements(tuple1, tuple2):
    """
    Find the union of the elements of two given tuples and output them in sorted order.
    """
    tuple1 = set(tuple1)
    tuple2 = set(tuple2)
    union_set = tuple1.union(tuple2)
    union_tuple = tuple(sorted(union_set))
    return union_tuple
```

This function first converts the tuples to sets, as sets don't allow duplicate values. Then it uses the union() method of the set class to find the union of the sets. The result is then converted back to a tuple using the tuple() function and sorted in ascending order using the sorted() function.

The assert statement checks if the function correctly finds the union of the elements of the two tuples and outputs them in sorted order.

The expected output is: (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10)

The output of the assert statement will be True if the function is correct, and False if it is incorrect.

This solution is efficient as it only requires a single pass over the input data, and uses built-in Python functions for set operations and sorting, which are highly optimized.

This solution is also flexible and can handle tuples of any length and with any number of duplicate elements, as long as the elements are hashable (i.e., they can be used as dictionary keys).

Lastly, this solution is easy to understand and maintain, as it uses straightforward logic and built-in Python functions.

Here is the function with the assert statement:

```python
def union_elements(tuple1, tuple2):
    """
    Find the union of the elements of two given tuples and output them in sorted order.
    """
    tuple1 = set(tuple1)
    tuple2 = set(tuple2)
    union_set = tuple1.union(tuple2)
    union_tuple = tuple(sorted(union_set))
    return union_tuple

assert union_elements((3, 4, 5, 6),(5, 7, 4, 10) ) == (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10)
