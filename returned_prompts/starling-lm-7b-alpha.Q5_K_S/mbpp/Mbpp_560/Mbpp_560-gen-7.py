    # Convert both tuples to lists for easier manipulation

```

To use the function, you can call it with two tuples as arguments:
```python
result = union_elements((3, 4, 5, 6), (5, 7, 4, 10))
print(result)  # Output: (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10)
```
This will print the union of the elements of the two tuples in sorted order.

Explanation:
The `union_elements` function takes two tuples as input. It first converts the tuples to lists using the `list()` function. Then, it combines the lists using the `+` operator to create a new list. Next, it sorts the combined list using the `sorted()` function and converts it back to a tuple using the `tuple()` function. Finally, it returns the sorted tuple as the result.

In the given example, the function is called with the tuples `(3, 4, 5, 6)` and `(5, 7, 4, 10)`. The union of these two tuples is `(3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10)`, which is then printed as the output.

By using this function, you can easily find the union of elements in two tuples and obtain the result in sorted order.

Note: It's important to note that the `union_elements` function modifies the original tuples by converting them to lists and then back to tuples. If you want to keep the original tuples unchanged, you can make a copy of the
