```
def union_elements(t1, t2):
    t3 = list(set(t1 + t2))
    t3.sort()
    return tuple(t3)
```

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. We define a function called `union_elements` that takes two tuples, `t1` and `t2`, as input parameters.
2. Inside the function, we convert the tuples into a list using the `list()` function. This allows us to perform operations like adding and sorting elements, which are not possible with tuples directly.
3. We use the `set()` function to create a new set, `t3`, which removes any duplicate elements from the concatenated list of `t1` and `t2`.
4. Next, we convert `t3` back into a tuple using the `tuple()` function. This is necessary because the function should return a tuple, as specified in the problem statement.
5. Finally, we use the `sort()` method to sort the elements of `t3` in ascending order. This ensures that the output is in the sorted order as required.
6. The sorted tuple is then returned as the result of the function.

To test the function, we can use the `assert` statement to compare the output of the function with the expected result. In this case, the expected result is `(3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10)`. If the function returns the correct result, the assertion will pass and no error will be raised.

Overall, this solution effectively finds the union of the elements of two tuples and outputs them in sorted order, as required by the problem statement.

```python
def union_elements(t1, t2):
    t3 = list(set(t1 + t2))
    t3.sort()
    return tuple(t3)
```

```python
assert union_elements((3, 4, 5, 6),(5, 7, 4, 10) ) == (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10)
```

```
True
```
