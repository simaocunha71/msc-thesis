"""
To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Define a function called `extract_quotation` that takes a string as an argument.
2. Split the string into a list of words using the space character as the separator.
3. Initialize an empty list called `values` to store the extracted values.
4. Iterate over each word in the list.
5. Check if the word starts with a quotation mark " and ends with a quotation mark ". If it does, append the word (without the quotation marks) to the `values` list.
6. After iterating over all the words, return the `values` list.
7. Test the function by calling `extract_quotation` with the provided example string and checking if the returned list matches the expected output.
