To solve this problem, you can use regular expressions to find all the substrings between quotation marks in the given string. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:

1. Import the `re` module, which provides support for regular expressions in Python.
2. Define the pattern for the regular expression that will match the substrings between quotation marks. In this case, the pattern is r'"(.*?)"'. This pattern matches any sequence of characters (.*?) enclosed in double quotation marks.
3. Define the `extract_quotation` function that takes a string as input.
4. Use the `re.findall` function to find all the substrings that match the pattern in the given string. The `re.findall` function returns a list of all matches.
5. Return the list of matches as the result of the `extract_quotation` function.
6. Test the `extract_quotation` function with the given example `'Cortex "A53" Based "multi" tasking "Processor"'` and assert that the output is `['A53', 'multi', 'Processor']`.

Here is the complete code:

import re

def extract_quotation(s):
    pattern = r'"(.*?)"'
    return re.findall(pattern, s)

# Test the function
assert extract_quotation('Cortex "A53" Based "multi" tasking "Processor"') == ['A53', 'multi', 'Processor']

# Further tests:
print(extract_quotation("'Here are some quotes!'"))  # should return ['Here are some quotes!']
print(extract_quotation('"Hello, world!"'))  # should return ['Hello, world!']
print(extract_quotation("""It's "alright" to have a "few" quotes"""))  # should return ['alright', 'few']
print(extract_quotation("""This is a "test""""))  # should return ['test']
print(extract_quotation("""This is a "test""""))  # should return ['test']
print(extract_quotation("""This is a ""test""""))  # should return ['test']
