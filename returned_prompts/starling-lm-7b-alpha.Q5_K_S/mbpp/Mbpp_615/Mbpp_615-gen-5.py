```
def average_tuple(tup):
    ans = []
    for i in tup:
        ans.append(sum(i)/len(i))
    return ans
```

In this code, a function `average_tuple` is defined which takes a tuple of tuples as a parameter. The function initializes an empty list `ans` to store the average values. Then, for each tuple `i` in the input tuple, the sum of all elements in `i` is calculated using the `sum` function, and the average value is obtained by dividing the sum by the length of `i` using the `len` function. The average value is then appended to the `ans` list. Finally, the `ans` list is returned as the result.

To test the function, an assertion is used to check if the function correctly calculates the average values for the given input `((10, 10, 10, 12), (30, 45, 56, 45), (81, 80, 39, 32), (1, 2, 3, 4))`, which should equal `[30.5, 34.25, 27.0, 23.25]`.

Overall, this code provides a solution to calculate the average value for each tuple in a tuple of tuples, and the result is a list containing the average values.

```python
def average_tuple(tup):
    ans = []
    for i in tup:
        ans.append(sum(i)/len(i))
    return ans
```

This function defines a function called `average_tuple` that takes a tuple of tuples as an argument. The function initializes an empty list `ans` to store the average values. Then, for each tuple `i` in the input tuple, the function calculates the sum of all elements in `i` using the `sum` function, and divides the sum by the length of `i` using the `len` function to obtain the average value. The average value is then appended to the `ans` list. Finally, the function returns the `ans` list, which contains the average values of the input tuples.
