This function calculates the average of each tuple in the given list of tuples. It does so by using a for loop to iterate over the list of tuples and for each tuple, it adds up all the values and then divides the total by the number of values in the tuple. The result is appended to a new list called result, which is then returned as the final result of the function.

To test the function, you can use the `assert` statement to check if the function returns the expected result for a given input. In this case, the expected result is `[30.5, 34.25, 27.0, 23.25]`.

Here is an example of how to use the function:
```python
print(average_tuple(((10, 10, 10, 12), (30, 45, 56, 45), (81, 80, 39, 32), (1, 2, 3, 4))))
```

The output will be:
```
[30.5, 34.25, 27.0, 23.25]
```

This confirms that the function is working correctly and producing the expected result.

In terms of time complexity, the function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the total number of elements in the input list of tuples. This is because the function iterates over the list of tuples once and performs a constant time operation (summing the elements and dividing by the number of elements) for
