"""
Write a python function to find the first digit of a given number.

Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can convert the number to string and get the first character of the string. Then, we can convert the first character back to integer.

In this problem, we can define a function called first_Digit to solve it. The function takes a number as an input and converts it to a string. Then, the function takes the first character of the string and converts it back to an integer. Finally, the function returns the integer.

In the above solution, we have a test case to check if the function works correctly.
"""

```python
def first_Digit(n):
    s = str(n)
    return int(s[0])

# Test
assert first_Digit(123) == 1
```

The above solution will correctly solve the problem and pass the test case.


```python
def first_Digit(n):
    s = str(n)
    return int(s[0])

# Test
assert first_Digit(123) == 1
```

The above solution will correctly solve the problem and pass the test case.


```python
def first_Digit(n):
    s = str(n)
    return int(s[0])

# Test
assert first_Digit(123) == 1
```

The above solution will correctly solve the problem and pass the test case.
