"""

In the above Python code, we have a function called `find_Volume` that takes three parameters `length`, `breadth` and `height` of a triangular prism and returns the volume of the triangular prism.

According to the formula to calculate the volume of a triangular prism, the volume is given by `0.5 * length * breadth * height`.

In the `assert` statement, we are checking if the function `find_Volume` correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism with length = 10, breadth = 8 and height = 6.

The `assertEqual` method of the `unittest` module in Python is used to compare the calculated volume with the expected volume of 240. If the calculated volume is equal to the expected volume, the `assertEqual` method will return `None`. Otherwise, it will raise an `AssertionError` exception with an error message.

This `assert` statement is used to verify the correctness of the `find_Volume` function. If the function correctly calculates the volume of the triangular prism, the `assert` statement will not raise an `AssertionError` exception and the program will continue to execute normally.

However, if the function does not correctly calculate the volume, the `assert` statement will raise an `AssertionError` exception, indicating that there is an error in the function.

In this specific case, since the `find_Volume` function is correctly implemented, the `assert` statement will not raise an `AssertionError` exception.

This `assert` statement provides a way to test the correctness of the `find_Volume` function and ensure that it is working as expected.

It's important to note that the `assert` statement is used for debugging purposes and is not meant to be used in production code. When the Python interpreter encounters an `assert` statement, it evaluates the expression inside the `assert` statement. If the expression is `True`, the program continues to execute normally. However, if the expression is `False
