In the above code, the function find_Volume is defined to find the volume of a triangular prism. The volume of a triangular prism is the area of its base times its height divided by 2. The function takes three arguments a, b and c representing the base and height of the triangular prism. The function uses the formula a*b*c/2 to calculate the volume of the triangular prism. The assert statement is used to check if the function correctly calculates the volume of the triangular prism with the given inputs. The print statement is used to print the result of the function when called with the inputs 10, 8 and 6.

The correct and complete solution would be:
"""
def find_Volume(base, height, length):
    return (base * height * length)/2

assert find_Volume(10,8,6) == 240
print(find_Volume(10,8,6))
