def find_tuples(tuples, k):
    return [t for t in tuples if all(i % k == 0 for i in t)]
```

This function takes in a list of tuples and a divisor k. It then uses a list comprehension to iterate through the list of tuples, checking if all elements of each tuple are divisible by k using the `all` function. The `all` function returns True if all elements in an iterable are true, and False otherwise. The function returns a new list of tuples that satisfy the condition.

The `find_tuples` function can be tested using the provided assert statement, which checks if the function correctly identifies the tuple `(6, 24, 12)` as the only tuple where all elements are divisible by 6.

Here's an example of how to use the `find_tuples` function:
```python
tuples = [(6, 24, 12), (7, 9, 6), (12, 18, 21)]
k = 6
result = find_tuples(tuples, k)
print(result)  # Output: [(6, 24, 12)]
```

This code defines a list of tuples and a divisor k. It then calls the `find_tuples` function with these inputs, and stores the result in the `result` variable. Finally, it prints the `result`, which should be `[(6, 24, 12)]`.

```python
```

In this example, the `find_tuples` function is used to find all tuples in the `tuples` list where all elements are divisible by the divisor `k`. The result is stored in the `result` variable and printed to the console.

The `find_tuples` function uses a list comprehension to iterate through the `tuples` list. For each tuple `t`, it checks if all elements `i` in the tuple are divisible by `k` using the `all` function. If all elements are divisible by `k`, the tuple is added to the result list.

The provided assert statement is used to verify that the `find_tuples
