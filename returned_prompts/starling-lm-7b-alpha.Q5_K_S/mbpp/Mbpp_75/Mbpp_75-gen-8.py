To solve this problem, you can use a loop to iterate through each tuple in the given list of tuples. Then, you can use a for loop to iterate through each element in the tuple to check if it is divisible by k. If all elements in the tuple are divisible by k, then the tuple will be added to a result list. Finally, the function should return the result list containing the tuples that have all elements divisible by k.

Here is the Python code to solve this problem:

"""

def find_tuples(list_of_tuples, k):
    result = []
    for t in list_of_tuples:
        all_divisible = True
        for elem in t:
            if elem % k != 0:
                all_divisible = False
                break
        if all_divisible:
            result.append(t)
    return result

# Test the function
print(find_tuples([(6, 24, 12), (7, 9, 6), (12, 18, 21)], 6))  # Output: [(6, 24, 12)]

"""
In this code, the find_tuples function takes two parameters: list_of_tuples, which is the list of tuples to be checked, and k, which is the divisor to check for. The function initializes an empty list called result to store the tuples that satisfy the condition. 

The function then uses a for loop to iterate through each tuple in the list_of_tuples. Inside this loop, another for loop is used to iterate through each element in the tuple. The variable all_divisible is set to True at the beginning of the inner loop. If any element in the tuple is not divisible by k, the variable all_divisible is set to False and the inner loop is broken using the break statement. If all elements in the tuple are divisible by k, the tuple is added to the result list.

Finally, the function returns the result list containing the tuples that have all elements divisible by k. The provided test case is used to verify that the function works correctly.
