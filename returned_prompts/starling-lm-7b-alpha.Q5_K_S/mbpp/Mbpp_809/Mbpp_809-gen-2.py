"""
This function first checks if the lengths of the tuples are equal. If they are not, the function returns False because the second tuple cannot have an element smaller than the one in the first tuple if they are not the same length. Then the function loops through each element of the tuples and compares the corresponding elements. If at any point the element in the first tuple is greater than the element in the second tuple, the function returns False because it violates the condition of the problem. If the function completes the loop and the lengths of the tuples are equal and each element in the first tuple is smaller than its corresponding element in the second tuple, the function returns True.

The assert statement tests the function with the provided example, which should return False.

"""
The function works by comparing each element of the first tuple with its corresponding element in the second tuple. If any element in the first tuple is greater than its corresponding element in the second tuple, the function returns False. If all elements in the first tuple are less than their corresponding elements in the second tuple, the function returns True. This confirms whether or not each element of the second tuple is smaller than its corresponding element in the first tuple.
"""

"""
The function can be used to determine if each element of a tuple is smaller than its corresponding element in another tuple. It can be applied in situations where it's necessary to compare two tuples element by element to ensure that each element in the second tuple is smaller than the one in the first tuple.
"""

"""
The function can be applied in various contexts where it's necessary to compare two tuples element by element to ensure that each element in the second tuple is smaller than the one in the first tuple. For example, it can be used in sorting algorithms, data validation, or any situation where the relative order of elements in two tuples needs to be determined.
