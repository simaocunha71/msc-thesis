"""
The function check_smaller(t1, t2) checks if each element of tuple t1 is smaller than its corresponding element in tuple t2.
In the for loop, the function iterates over the indices of t1.
For each index i, the function compares the element at index i in t1 with the element at index i in t2.
If the element at index i in t1 is not smaller than the element at index i in t2, the function returns False.
After the for loop, if none of the elements in t1 are not smaller than their corresponding elements in t2, the function returns True.

# The function check_smaller(t1, t2) checks if each element of tuple t1 is smaller than its corresponding element in tuple t2.
# It does this by iterating over the indices of t1 in a for loop and comparing the elements at each index in t1 and t2.
# If any element in t1 is not smaller than its corresponding element in t2, the function returns False.
