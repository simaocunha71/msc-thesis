"""
Explanation:

In this problem, we need to compare each element of the first tuple with its corresponding element in the second tuple.

We start by checking if the lengths of the two tuples are equal. If they are not, we can immediately return False, as the tuples cannot be compared.

Next, we use the zip() function to iterate over the two tuples simultaneously. The zip() function pairs up the corresponding elements of the two tuples.

Inside the loop, we compare each pair of elements. If any pair violates the condition that the element in the first tuple is smaller than the corresponding element in the second tuple, we return False.

If we reach the end of the loop without finding any violations, we can conclude that all the elements in the second tuple are smaller than their corresponding elements in the first tuple, and we return True.

The provided test cases demonstrate the correctness of the function.

# Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the tuples. This is because we only need to go through the tuples once.
# Space Complexity: O(1), as we only need a constant
