In this code, we are using the for loop to iterate over the range of the length of the first tuple. Inside the loop, we are comparing the elements of the two tuples at the same index. If any element of the second tuple is greater than the corresponding element of the first tuple, we return False as it means that the condition is not satisfied. If the loop completes without returning False, it means that every element of the second tuple is smaller than its corresponding element in the first tuple and hence we return True.

"""
Explanation:

In the provided code, a function named "check_smaller" is defined to compare two tuples and determine if the corresponding elements of the second tuple are smaller than the corresponding elements of the first tuple.

The function takes two arguments, "tup1" and "tup2", which are the first and second tuples to be compared, respectively.

Inside the function, a for loop is used to iterate over the range of the length of the first tuple. This loop allows us to compare each element of the first tuple with its corresponding element in the second tuple.

Within the loop, an if statement is used to check if the current element of the second tuple is greater than the corresponding element in the first tuple. If
