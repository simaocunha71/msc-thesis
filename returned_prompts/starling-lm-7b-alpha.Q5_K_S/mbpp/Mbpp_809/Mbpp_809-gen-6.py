In Python, you can create a function called `check_smaller` to check if each element of the second tuple is smaller than its corresponding element in the first tuple. Here's a step-by-step guide to accomplishing this:

1. Define the function `check_smaller` that takes in two tuples as arguments: `t1` and `t2`.
2. Use the `zip` function to iterate over both tuples simultaneously, comparing each pair of elements.
3. Use the `all` function along with a generator expression to check if all pairs of elements in the first tuple are smaller than their corresponding elements in the second tuple. The `all` function returns `True` if all elements in the iterable are `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.
4. Return the result of the `all` function as the output of the `check_smaller` function.
5. Test the function by calling it with different tuples and asserting the expected results using the `assert` keyword.

Here's an example implementation of the function in Python:

```python
def check_smaller(t1, t2):
    return all(a < b for a, b in zip(t1, t2))

assert check_smaller((1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 4)) == False
assert check_smaller((1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 3)) == True
```

In the first assertion, the function returns `False` because the first element of the first tuple (`1`) is not smaller than the first element of the second tuple (`2`). In the second assertion, the function returns `True` because all elements in the first tuple (`1`, `2`, `3`) are smaller than their corresponding elements in the second tuple (`1`, `2`, `3`).

def check_smaller(t1, t2):
    return all(a < b for a, b in zip(t1, t2))

assert check_smaller((1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 4)) == False
assert check_smaller((1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 3)) == True
