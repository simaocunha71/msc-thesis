Here is a Python solution to the problem.
The function `check_none` takes a tuple `t` as input and checks if there are any `None` values in the tuple. It does this by iterating through each element in the tuple and checking if the element is `None`. If a `None` value is found, the function returns `True`. If no `None` values are found, the function returns `False`.

In the provided example, the function `check_none` is called with the tuple `(10, 4, 5, 6, None)`. Since this tuple contains a `None` value, the function will return `True`.

The `assert` statement is used to check if the expected output of the function matches the actual output. In this case, the expected output is `True` and the actual output is also `True`, so the `assert` statement will pass and no error will be raised.

Overall, this solution provides a way to check if a given tuple contains any `None` values.
