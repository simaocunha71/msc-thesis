"""
To solve this, we can use the built-in Python function any().
This function returns True if at least one element in the tuple is True, otherwise it returns False.

Here's how you can implement the check_none function:
"""

def check_none(t):
    return any(x is None for x in t)

# Test
print(check_none((10, 4, 5, 6, None)))  # Returns True
print(check_none((10, 4, 5, 6)))  # Returns False

"""
In this function, we use a generator expression to create a new tuple that contains only the none values in the original tuple. We then use the any() function to check if any of the values in this tuple is True. If any of the values is True, the any() function will return True; otherwise, it will return False.
