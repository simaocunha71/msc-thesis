Explanation:
The above Python program defines a function `hexagonal_num` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth hexagonal number. The function uses the formula `(n * (n + 1) * (3 * n + 1)) // 6` to calculate the hexagonal number. 

In the driver code, the program takes an integer `n` as input from the user and calls the `hexagonal_num` function with this input. The result is printed to the console. 

The `assert` statement is used to check if the function is correctly calculating the nth hexagonal number. In this case, the assertion checks if `hexagonal_num(10)` is equal to 190, which is the expected result. 

Overall, the program finds and prints the nth hexagonal number based on the user's input.
