```
def hexagonal_num(n):
    return n * (3 * n - 1) // 2
```

Explanation:

A hexagonal number is a number that is the sum of the first n positive integers, where n is a positive integer. The formula for the nth hexagonal number is (n * (3 * n - 1)) // 2. 

In the provided function, the parameter n represents the position of the hexagonal number in the sequence. The function calculates the nth hexagonal number by substituting n into the formula and returns the result. 

To test the function, the assert statement is used. It compares the result of the function hexagonal_num(10) with the expected result of 190. If the results are equal, the assertion passes, indicating that the function is correct.

In this case, the assert statement is true, as hexagonal_num(10) returns 190, confirming that the function correctly calculates the nth hexagonal number.

Note: The function hexagonal_num(n) calculates the nth hexagonal number, where n is a positive integer.

```python
def hexagonal_num(n):
    return n * (3 * n - 1) // 2
```

You can use the above function to find the nth hexagonal number by calling it with the desired value of n. For example, to find the 10th hexagonal number, you can call `hexagonal_num(10)` and it will return 190. 

This function can be used to generate a sequence of hexagonal numbers by calling it with different values of n. 

The formula for the nth hexagonal number is derived from the observation that the sum of the first n positive integers can be expressed as the product of n and the average of the first and last terms in the sum. In this case, the average of the first and last terms is (1 + n) / 2, and the product of n and the average is (n * (1 + n)) / 2. 

To find the nth hexagonal number, you can use the formula (n * (3 * n - 1)) // 2.
