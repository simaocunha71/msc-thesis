def hexagonal_num(n):
    return n * (3 * n + 1) // 2
```

Explanation:
The nth hexagonal number is defined as the sum of the first n positive integers, each multiplied by 3 and then multiplied by 2. In other words, the hexagonal number is given by the formula n * (3 * n + 1) // 2. To find the nth hexagonal number, you can simply plug in the value of n into this formula and calculate the result.

In the given solution, the function hexagonal_num takes an integer n as input and returns the nth hexagonal number using the formula mentioned above. The function uses integer division (//) to ensure that the result is an integer, as hexagonal numbers are always integers.

For example, if you call hexagonal_num(10), it will return 190, which is the 10th hexagonal number.

Overall, the solution provides a concise and efficient way to calculate the nth hexagonal number using the given formula.

```python
def hexagonal_num(n):
    return n * (3 * n + 1) // 2
```

Explanation:
The function `hexagonal_num` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the `n`th hexagonal number using the formula `n * (3 * n + 1) // 2`. This formula is derived from the definition of hexagonal numbers, which are obtained by summing up the first `n` positive integers, each multiplied by 3 and then multiplied by 2. 

For example, if you call `hexagonal_num(10)`, it will return `190`, which is the 10th hexagonal number. 

The function uses integer division (`//`) to ensure that the result is an integer, as hexagonal numbers are always integers. 

In summary, the solution provides a straightforward and efficient way to calculate the `n`th hexagonal number using the given formula.
```python
def hexagonal_num(n):
    return n * (3 * n + 1) // 2
```
