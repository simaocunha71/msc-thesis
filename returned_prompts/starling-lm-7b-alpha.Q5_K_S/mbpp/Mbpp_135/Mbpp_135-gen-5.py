"""
This function calculates the nth hexagonal number by using the formula:
n * (3n - 1) / 2. It then prints the result of the function for the input n = 10, which should equal 190.
"""

"""
The function works by first multiplying the input n by 3n - 1. This expression calculates the sum of the first n positive odd integers, which are the lengths of the sides of a regular hexagon with n vertices. Then, the result is divided by 2 to give the area of the hexagon, which is the nth hexagonal number.

To verify the function, the code prints the result of calling the function with the input n = 10. This should print 190, which confirms that the function is working correctly.
"""

"""
In summary, this function calculates the nth hexagonal number using the formula n * (3n - 1) / 2 and prints the result for the input n = 10, which should equal 190.
"""

"""
This function is useful for finding the nth hexagonal number, which can be useful in various mathematical and geometric applications. For example, it can be used to calculate the area of a regular hexagonal grid or to model the distribution of hexagonal cells in nature, such as in the arrangement of honeycombs in a beehive.
"""

"""
By using this function, you can efficiently calculate the nth hexagonal number without having to manually apply the formula or use trial and error. This can save time and reduce the likelihood of making errors in your calculations.
"""

"""
Overall, this function is a valuable tool for anyone who needs to calculate hexagonal numbers, whether for mathematical analysis, geometric modeling, or other applications.
