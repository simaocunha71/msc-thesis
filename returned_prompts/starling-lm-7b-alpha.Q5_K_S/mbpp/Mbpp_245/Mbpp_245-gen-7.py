Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of a bitonic sequence. A bitonic sequence is a sequence that first increases and then decreases. In this case, we are looking for the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence in the given array.

To find the maximum sum, we can use dynamic programming. We can create two arrays, `max_sum_left` and `max_sum_right`, to store the maximum sum of bitonic subsequences at each index. The `max_sum_left` array will store the maximum sum of bitonic subsequences ending at each index, while the `max_sum_right` array will store the maximum sum of bitonic subsequences starting at each index.

We start by initializing `max_sum_left` with the first element of the array, `nums[0]`. Then, we iterate through the rest of the array from index 1 to `len(nums) - 1`. At each index, we update `max_sum_left[i]` to be the maximum of `max_sum_left[i-1]` and `nums[i]`. This ensures that we are considering the maximum sum of bitonic subsequences ending at each index.

Next, we initialize `max_sum_right` with the last element of the array, `nums[-1]`. Then, we iterate through the array from `len(nums) - 2` to 0. At each index, we update `max_sum_right[i]` to be the maximum of `max_sum_right[i+1]` and `nums
