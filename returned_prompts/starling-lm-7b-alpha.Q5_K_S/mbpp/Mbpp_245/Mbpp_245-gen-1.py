Here's one possible solution:

```python
def max_sum(nums):
    if len(nums) == 1:
        return nums[0]
    else:
        left_max = max_sum(nums[:len(nums)//2])
        right_max = max_sum(nums[len(nums)//2:])
        middle = nums[len(nums)//2]
        return max(left_max, right_max, left_max + right_max + middle)
```

This solution uses recursion to divide the array into two halves until it reaches the base case of having a single element. Then, it sums up the maximum values of the left half, the right half, and the middle element, and returns the maximum of these three values as the result.

However, it's important to note that this solution has a time complexity of O(2^n), which is not ideal for large arrays. There are more efficient algorithms available, such as the bitonic-lift algorithm, which can solve this problem in linear time, O(n).

Here's an example implementation of the bitonic-lift algorithm:

```python
def max_sum(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    dp = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = nums[i]
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(n - i):
            dp[j] += max(dp[j], dp[j + i])
    return dp[0]
```

This implementation uses dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum sum at each position in the array, and it uses the bitonic-lift algorithm to efficiently calculate the maximum sum in linear time.

Overall, while the original solution provides a straightforward approach to solving the problem, the bitonic-lift algorithm offers a more efficient solution.
