"""
To solve this problem, we can use the concept of a bitonic subsequence. A bitonic subsequence is a sequence that is first increasing and then decreasing. We can use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. Initialize the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence as 0.
2. Iterate through each number in the array. For each number, initialize a variable called 'left' to the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence ending at the previous index.
3. Initialize a variable called 'right' to the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence ending at the current index.
4. Iterate through the previous numbers in the array. For each number, calculate the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence that ends at the current index and includes the current number and the previous number.
5. If the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence that ends at the current index and includes the current number and the previous number is greater than the current 'right' value, update 'right' with the new maximum sum.
6. After iterating through all the previous numbers, update the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence with the maximum of 'left' and 'right'.
7. Repeat steps 2-6 until all numbers in the array have been processed.
8. Return the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the length of the array. The space complexity is also O(n^2).
