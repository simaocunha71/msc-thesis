        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if nums[j] > nums[i]:
                dp[i % 2][j] = max(dp[(i + 1) % 2][j] + nums[j], dp[i % 2][j - 1])
            else:
                dp[i % 2][j] = max(dp[i % 2][j - 1], dp[(i + 1) % 2][j])

Here, we are using a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem. The idea is to use two arrays `dp[i % 2]` to store the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence ending at index `i`. We initialize `dp[i % 2][i]` as the value at index `i` in the given array. Then, we iterate over the array and for each index `j`, we check if `nums[j]` is greater than `nums[i]`. If it is, then the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence ending at `j` is the maximum of the sum of the subsequence ending at `j` and the value at `j`, and the sum of the subsequence ending at `j - 1`. Otherwise, the maximum sum is the maximum of the sum of the subsequence ending at `j - 1` and the sum of the subsequence ending at `j`. Finally, we return the maximum sum of the bitonic subsequence ending at the last index of the array, which is `dp[n % 2][-1]`.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input array. This is because we are iterating over the array twice, once for each dynamic programming array. The space complexity is also O(n^2) because we are storing the maximum sums for all
