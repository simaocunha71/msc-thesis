"""
Correct Solution:
The solution to this problem is to use dynamic programming.
We can initialize a table of size n + 1 with all values set to 0. We will use this table to store the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence for all possible lengths.
For each length from 2 to n, we will iterate over the previous length and update the table entry for each index i to be the maximum of the previous table entry at i and i + 1.
Finally, we will return the maximum entry in the table, which will be the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence for the given array.
