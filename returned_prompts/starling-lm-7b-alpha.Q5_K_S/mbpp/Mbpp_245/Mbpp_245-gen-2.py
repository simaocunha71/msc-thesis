def max_sum(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    dp = [0] * n
    dp[0] = arr[0]
    dp[1] = max(arr[0], arr[1])

    for i in range(2, n):
        dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], arr[i] + dp[i-2])

    return dp[n-1]
```

Explanation:
To solve the problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We will maintain a dynamic programming array `dp` of size `n` to store the maximum sum at each index. 

First, we initialize the first two elements of the `dp` array to be the first two elements of the input array. 

Then, we iterate through the rest of the array starting from the third element. For each element, we calculate the maximum sum by either including the current element or excluding the current element. If we include the current element, we add it to the maximum sum of the previous element. If we exclude the current element, we take the maximum sum of the previous element. We store this maximum sum in the `dp` array at the current index. 

Finally, we return the maximum sum at the last index of the `dp` array, which represents the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence for the given array.

This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array.

The provided code demonstrates the implementation of the `max_sum` function, which takes an array as input and returns the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence for the given array. The code initializes the `dp` array and iterates through the input array to calculate the maximum sum. The result is then returned as the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence for the given array.

You can test the code with the provided assert statement to verify that it correctly calculates the maximum sum for the given example input `[1, 15, 51, 45, 33, 100, 12, 18, 9]`, which should equal `194`.

```python
assert max_sum([1, 15, 51, 45,
