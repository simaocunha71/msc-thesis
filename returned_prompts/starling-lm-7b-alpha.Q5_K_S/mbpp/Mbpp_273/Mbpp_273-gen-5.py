```
def substract_elements(tuple1, tuple2):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(tuple1)):
        result.append(tuple1[i] - tuple2[i])
    return tuple(result)
```

The above function takes in two tuples and subtracts the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index. It then appends the result to a new list called `result`. Finally, it converts the list to a tuple and returns the result.

To test the function, you can use the `assert` statement to check if the function returns the expected result for the provided example: `substract_elements((10, 4, 5), (2, 5, 18)) == (8, -1, -13)`. If the assertion is true, it means the function is working correctly.

It's important to note that this solution assumes that the lengths of the input tuples are equal, as it doesn't explicitly check for that condition.

Additionally, the function uses the `range()` function to iterate over the indices of the tuples, ensuring that the subtraction is performed at the correct indices. The `append()` method is used to add the result of each subtraction to the `result` list. Finally, the `tuple()` function is used to convert the `result` list back to a tuple before returning it.

Overall, this solution provides a concise and efficient way to subtract the elements of one tuple from another, while ensuring the correct indexing and data type conversions.

In terms of efficiency, the `for` loop has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the tuples. The `append()` and `tuple()` functions have constant time complexity, O(1). Therefore, the overall time complexity of the function is O(n). The space complexity is also O(n) due to the `result` list storing the subtraction results.

Here are some additional considerations for this problem:

- If the lengths of the tuples are not equal, it's important to handle this scenario appropriately. One approach could be to raise an exception or return an error message, depending on the desired behavior. Alternatively, you could add a
