"""
The provided assert is an example of how the function should behave. In this case, it is asserting that when you subtract the elements of the tuple (2, 5, 18) from the tuple (10, 4, 5), you should get the tuple (8, -1, -13). 

To implement this functionality, you can define a function called substract_elements that takes in two tuples, let's call them tuple_1 and tuple_2. Inside the function, you can use the zip() function to iterate over both tuples simultaneously. The zip() function pairs up the elements at the same index of the two tuples. 

Next, you can use a list comprehension to subtract the corresponding elements of tuple_2 from tuple_1. This can be done by subtracting the second element of the zip-paired tuples from the first element. 

Finally, you can convert the resulting list back into a tuple using the tuple() function and return it as the output of the function. 

Here's an example implementation of the function:

def substract_elements(tuple_1, tuple_2):
    return tuple(a - b for a, b in zip(tuple_1, tuple_2))

You can then use the assert statement to test the function and ensure it is returning the expected result.
