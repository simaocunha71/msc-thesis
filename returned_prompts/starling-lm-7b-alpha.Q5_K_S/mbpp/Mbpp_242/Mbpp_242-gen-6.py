Here's a possible solution:

```python
def count_charac(str):
    return len(str)

def test_count_charac():
    assert count_charac("python programming")==18
```

Explanation:
The function `count_charac` takes a string `str` as input and returns the total number of characters in the string using the built-in `len` function. The `test_count_charac` function is used to test the `count_charac` function with the example string "python programming" and assert that the result is equal to 18, which is the correct number of characters in the string.

This solution passes the test and correctly counts the total number of characters in a string.
