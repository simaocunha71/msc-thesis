The time complexity of this code is O(n) because in the worst case, we will have to iterate through all the numbers till n-1 to check whether the number is prime or not.

"""
In this program, we have a function called prime_num(). It takes a number as an input and checks whether the given number is a prime number or not. If the number is greater than 1, the function will iterate through all the numbers till the given number and checks whether the given number is divisible by any of the numbers. If the given number is divisible by any of the numbers, the function returns False, which means the given number is not a prime number. If the given number is not divisible by any of the numbers, the function returns True, which means the given number is a prime number. If the given number is less than or equal to 1, the function returns False, which means the given number is not a prime number.
