# This program checks if an inputted number is prime

"""
This program first checks if the number is less than 2 because if it is, it is not prime. It then checks if the
number is equal to 2 because if it is, it is prime. It then checks if the number is divisible by 2 because if it is, it is not prime. It then checks if the number is equal to 3 because if it is, it is prime. It then checks if the number is divisible by 3 because if it is, it is not prime. It then initializes d with 5 and begins a while loop that ends when d is greater than the square root of the inputted number. Inside the loop, it checks if the number is divisible by d and d+2 because if it is, it is not prime. It increments d by 6 in each iteration because all prime numbers greater than 3 are of the form 6k Â± 1 where k is an integer. The function then returns true if all checks pass, meaning the number is prime, and false if any of the checks fail, meaning the number is not prime.
"""

# Test
print(prime_num(13))
"""
This line of code tests the function by passing in the number 13 and asserting that the output should be True. This is because 13 is a prime number, meaning it only has two factors, 1 and itself.
