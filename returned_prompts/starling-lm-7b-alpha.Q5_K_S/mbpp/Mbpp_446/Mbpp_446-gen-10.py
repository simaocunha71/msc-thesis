"""
The given problem is to count the occurrence of a list in a tuple.
The function takes two parameters: a tuple and a list.
The function first creates an empty dictionary called res to store the count of each element in the list.
Then, for each element in the list, it checks if the element is already in the dictionary.
If it is, it increments the count by 1. If not, it adds the element to the dictionary with an initial count of 1.
After that, for each element in the tuple, it checks if the element is already in the dictionary.
If it is, it increments the count by 1. If not, it adds the element to the dictionary with an initial count of 1.
Finally, the function returns the dictionary containing the count of each element in the tuple.

The function is tested with the provided assert statement and print statements to verify its correctness.

"""
The provided solution is correct.
It defines a function called count_Occurrence that takes two parameters: a tuple called t and a list called l.
Inside the function, it creates an empty dictionary called res to store the count of each element.
Then, it iterates over the list and checks if each element is already in the dictionary.
If it is, it
