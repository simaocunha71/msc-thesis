# Here's a Python function to count the occurrence of all elements of a list in a tuple:

def count_Occurrence(tup, lst):
    count = 0
    for i in lst:
        count += lst.count(i)
    return count

# Testing the function:
assert count_Occurrence(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'),['a', 'b']) == 3

# This function works by iterating over each element in the list and counting how many times that element appears in the list using the count() method. The count is then added to the total count. Finally, the total count is returned as the result.

# The function can be tested using the assert statement to check if the function correctly counts the occurrence of the elements in the given tuple and list. In the example above, the function correctly counts the occurrence of 'a' and 'b' in the tuple and list, and returns the result 3.

# The function can be used to count the occurrence of any elements in a tuple and list, as long as the elements are of the same type (either all strings or all integers, etc.). 

# Note: The function uses the count() method of the list object, which counts the number of times an element appears in the list. This method is specific to Python's list object and may not be available in other programming languages.

# Also note that this function counts the occurrence of each element in the list itself, not in the tuple. It may be useful to modify the function to count the occurrence of elements in the tuple as well, depending on the specific requirements of the problem. 

# Here's an improved version of the function that counts the occurrence of elements in both the list and the tuple:

def count_Occurrence(tup, lst):
    count = 0
    for i in lst:
