"""
This is a Python function that finds the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times. The function takes two arguments, the binary string and the number of rotations. The function first converts the binary string into a list of characters. Then, it iterates through each character in the list and rotates it n times. If the rotated character is '1', the count is incremented. Finally, the function returns the count of numbers with an odd value.

In the given example, the binary string is "011001" and the number of rotations is 6. The function rotates each character in the string 6 times and increments the count whenever a '1' is obtained. The result is 3, which means there are 3 numbers with an odd value after rotating the binary string 6 times.

# Testing the function
assert odd_Equivalent("011001",6) == 3

The assert statement is used to check if a condition is true. In this case, the condition is that the result of the odd_Equivalent function with the binary string "011001" and the number of rotations 6 should be equal to 3. If the condition is true, the assert statement does nothing. If the condition is false, an AssertionError is raised and an error message is displayed, indicating the expected and actual results.

In the given example, the assert statement is used to check if the odd_Equivalent function correctly returns 3 for the binary string "011001" and the number of rotations 6. Since the function
