Here's one way to do it:

```python
def sort_matrix(matrix):
    matrix = sorted(matrix, key = sum, reverse = True)
    return matrix
```

This function first sorts the rows of the matrix in ascending order according to their sums, and then returns the sorted matrix. Note that the `reverse = True` argument is used to sort the rows in descending order, as the problem statement asks for sorting in ascending order according to the sum of the rows.

The `sorted` function is used to sort the rows of the matrix. The `key` argument is used to specify a function of one argument that is used to extract a comparison key from each row. In this case, the `sum` function is used as the key function to extract the sum of each row. The `reverse` argument is set to `True` to sort the rows in descending order, as the problem statement asks for sorting in ascending order according to the sum of the rows.

Finally, the sorted matrix is returned by the function.

Here's an example usage of the function:

```python
matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 5], [1, 1, 1]]
print(sort_matrix(matrix))  # Output: [[1, 1, 1], [1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 5]]
```

This will print the sorted matrix according to the sum of its rows, as specified in the problem statement.
