To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Flatten the matrix into a 1D array.
2. Sort the array in ascending order based on the sum of rows.
3. Reshape the sorted array back into a matrix.
4. Return the sorted matrix.

The function `sort_matrix` takes a matrix as input and returns a sorted matrix based on the sum of its rows.

Here's how it works:

1. The `flat_array` variable is assigned the result of a list comprehension that iterates over each sublist in the `matrix` and each number in the sublist. This flattens the matrix into a 1D array.
2. The `sorted_array` variable is assigned the result of the `sorted` function, which sorts the `flat_array` in ascending order based on the sum of rows. The `key` parameter of the `sorted` function is set to a lambda function that calculates the sum of each row and returns it. This ensures that the array is sorted based on the sum of rows.
3. The `sorted_matrix` variable is assigned the result of a list comprehension that iterates over the `sorted_array` and groups it back into
