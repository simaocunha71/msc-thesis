"""
Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. First, we define a function called sort_matrix that takes a matrix as an argument.
2. Inside the function, we create a list called result to store the sorted matrix.
3. We then iterate over the indices of the matrix using a for loop.
4. For each index, we calculate the sum of the row by using the sum function on the current row of the matrix.
5. Next, we append the row to the result list along with its sum as a tuple.
6. After iterating through all the rows, we sort the result list based on the sum of the rows in ascending order using the sorted function and a lambda function.
7. Finally, we return the sorted result list, which will be in ascending order according to the sum of its rows.
8. To test the function, we use the assert statement to verify the expected output.

def sort_matrix(matrix):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(matrix)):
        result.append((matrix[i], sum(matrix[i])))
    result.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
    return result

# Test the function
matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 5], [1, 1, 1]]
print(sort_matrix(matrix))  # Output: [[1, 1, 1], [1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 5]]

# As a complete Python program
matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 5], [1, 1, 1]]
print(sort_matrix(matrix))  # Output: [[1, 1, 1], [1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 5]]
