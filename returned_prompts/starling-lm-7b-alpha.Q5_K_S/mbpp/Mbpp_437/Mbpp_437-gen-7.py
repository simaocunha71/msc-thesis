def remove_odd(s):
    ret = ""

        if ord(c) % 2 == 0:
            ret += c
    return ret
```

Explanation:
In the code above, we use the ord() function to get the ASCII value of each character in the string s, and then check if the ASCII value is even (divisible by 2). If it's even, we add the character to the result string ret. This way, we only keep even-valued characters in the result.
The assert statement at the end is used to verify the correctness of the remove_odd function. It checks if the result of remove_odd("python") is equal to "yhn", which should be True if the function is working correctly.

In the given code, the assert statement is used to test the correctness of the remove_odd function. It checks if the result of remove_odd("python") is equal to "yhn". If this statement is True, it means that the function is working correctly.

The remove_odd function takes a string s as input and returns a new string with all odd-valued characters removed. It does this by iterating over each character in the input string s, and checking if the ASCII value of the character is even (divisible by 2). If it is, the character is added to a new string ret. This way, only even-valued characters are included in the result string ret.

The assert statement is used to verify the correctness of the remove_odd function. It checks if the result of remove_odd("python") is equal to "yhn", which should be True if the function is working correctly. If the assert statement is False, it means that there is an error in the function and it needs to be fixed.

In conclusion, the remove_odd function removes odd-valued characters from a string and the assert statement is used to verify the correctness of the function.

Here are some additional points to note:

The ord() function is a built-in Python function that returns the Unicode code point of a character. It is used to get the ASCII value of a character in the string s.

The ASCII values range from 0 to 127, and even numbers
