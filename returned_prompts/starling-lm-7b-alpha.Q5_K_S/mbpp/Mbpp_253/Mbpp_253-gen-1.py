```
def count_integer(input_list):
    return sum(1 for i in input_list if isinstance(i, int))
```

Explanation:
The above Python program defines a function called `count_integer` that takes a single argument `input_list`. It then uses a generator expression along with the `sum()` function to count the number of integer elements in the `input_list`. The `isinstance(i, int)` condition checks if the element `i` in the list is an integer, and if so, the generator yields 1. The `sum()` function then sums up all the 1's yielded by the generator, effectively counting the number of integer elements in the list.

To test the function, an `assert` statement is used to check if the function returns the expected result for a given input list `[1,2,'abc',1.2]`. The expected result is 2, as there are two integer elements (1 and 2) in the list.

The function can be called by passing a list as an argument, like this: `count_integer([1,2,'abc',1.2])`. This will return the number of integer elements in the list, which in this case is 2.

Overall, this Python function provides a concise and efficient way to count the number of integer elements in a given list.

Here are some additional test cases to validate the function's correctness:
```python
print(count_integer([1,2,3,4,5]))  # Output: 5
print(count_integer([1,2,'abc',3.4]))  # Output: 2
print(count_integer([]))  # Output: 0
```

In the first test case, all the elements in the list are integers, so the function correctly returns the count as 5. In the second test case, there are two integer elements (1 and 3), so the function returns the correct count of 2. The third test case checks the function's behavior when the list is empty, and correctly returns 0 as there are no integer elements.

These test cases validate that the `count_integer` function works as expected and can handle various scenarios, including empty lists and lists with a mix of integer and non-integer elements
