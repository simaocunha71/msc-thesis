To solve this problem, we can use the built-in Python function `sum()` to calculate the sum of all the numbers in a list. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Define a function `sum_negativenum` that takes a list as an input.
2. Use a list comprehension to filter out all the negative numbers from the input list.
3. Calculate the sum of these filtered numbers using the `sum()` function and return the result.

Here's the Python code to implement this solution:
```python
def sum_negativenum(nums):
    return sum([num for num in nums if num < 0])
```
This function will return the sum of the negative numbers in the input list. For example, if you call `sum_negativenum([2, 4, -6, -9, 11, -12, 14, -5, 17])`, it will return `-32`.

To verify the correctness of this function, you can use the built-in Python function `assert` to check if the calculated sum matches the expected result. Here's an example:
```python
assert sum_negativenum([2, 4, -6, -9, 11, -12, 14, -5, 17]) == -32
```
If the function is correctly implemented, this assertion will pass and no error will be raised.







answer:
To calculate the sum of the negative numbers of a given list, you can use the built-in Python function `sum()` in combination with a list comprehension. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Define a function `sum_negativenum` that takes a list as an input.
2. Use a list comprehension to filter out all the negative numbers from the input list. This can be done by iterating over each element in the list and checking if it is less than zero. If it is, include it in the new list.
3. Calculate the sum of these filtered numbers using the `sum()` function and return the result.

Here's the Python code to implement this solution:
```python
def sum_neg
