"""
Given an array of integers, calculate the sum of the negative numbers of this array.
Return the result.

Explanation:
In the example above, the array [2, 4, -6, -9, 11, -12, 14, -5, 17] contains three negative numbers: -6, -9 and -12.
The sum of these three numbers is -32.

Test:
assert sum_negativenum([2, 4, -6, -9, 11, -12, 14, -5, 17])==-32
