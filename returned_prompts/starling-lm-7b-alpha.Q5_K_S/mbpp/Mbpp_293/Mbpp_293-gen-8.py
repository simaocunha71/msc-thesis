Explanation:

The solution to the problem is to use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

In this case, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the third side of the right triangle. The formula for the Pythagorean theorem is c^2 = a^2 + b^2, where c is the length of the hypotenuse and a and b are the lengths
