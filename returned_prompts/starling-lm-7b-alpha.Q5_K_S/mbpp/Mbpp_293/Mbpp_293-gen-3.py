"""
The Pythagorean theorem is a fundamental relation in Euclidean geometry among the three sides of a right triangle. It states that the area of the square whose side length is the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares on the other two sides.

In a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. The Pythagorean theorem is usually written as: a^2 + b^2 = c^2, where a and b are the lengths of the two shorter sides, and c is the length of the hypotenuse.
