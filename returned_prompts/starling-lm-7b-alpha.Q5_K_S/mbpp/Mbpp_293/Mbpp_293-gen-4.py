"""
The function otherside_rightangle takes two sides of a right angled triangle and returns the third side of the triangle. It uses the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the third side of the triangle. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

In the function otherside_rightangle, the two sides of the right angled triangle are passed as parameters a and b. The function calculates the third side of the triangle using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. The function returns the calculated third side as a result.
