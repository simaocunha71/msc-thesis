Explanation:
The function `otherside_rightangle` takes two parameters `base` and `height` representing the base and height of a right-angled triangle. It uses the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the third side of the triangle, which is the hypotenuse. The function returns the calculated value.

In the provided code, the function is tested with the input values 7 and 8. The expected result is 10.63014581273465, which is the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle with a base of 7 and a height of 8.

The `sqrt` function from the `math` module is used to calculate the square root of the sum of the squares of the base and height, which gives us the length of the hypotenuse.
