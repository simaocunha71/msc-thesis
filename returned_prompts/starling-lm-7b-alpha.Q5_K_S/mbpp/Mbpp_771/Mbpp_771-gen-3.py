To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Create a stack to store the opening brackets.
2. Iterate over the expression.
3. For each opening bracket, push it on the stack.
4. For each closing bracket, pop the top of the stack to check if it is a matching opening bracket.
5. If the stack is empty after processing the expression, the expression is balanced. Otherwise, it is not balanced.

Here's the Python code to implement this solution:
"""

def check_expression(expression):
    stack = []
    for char in expression:
        if char in ["(", "{", "["]:
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in [")", "}", "]"]:
            if len(stack) == 0:
                return False
            if char == ")" and stack[-1] != "(":
                return False
            if char == "}" and stack[-1] != "{":
                return False
            if char == "]" and stack[-1] != "[":
                return False
            stack.pop()
    return len(stack) == 0

# Test the function
assert check_expression("{()}[{}]") == True
assert check_expression("(]{") == False
assert check_expression("{[(])}") == False

```

In the above code, we use a stack to keep track of opening brackets as we iterate through the expression. We push each opening bracket onto the stack and pop a closing bracket to check if it matches the top of the stack. If the stack is empty after processing the expression, the expression is balanced; otherwise, it is not balanced.

The check_expression function returns True if the expression is balanced and False otherwise.

The code includes a few assertions to test the function with different expressions to ensure it works correctly.

```

```
Here's a breakdown of the steps in the code:

1. We create an empty stack using the `stack = []` statement.
2. We iterate over each character in the expression using a for loop: `for char in expression:`.
3. For each opening
