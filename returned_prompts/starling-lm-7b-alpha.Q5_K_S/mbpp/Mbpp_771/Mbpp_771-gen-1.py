To solve this problem, we can use a stack to keep track of opening brackets. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize an empty stack. This stack will be used to store opening brackets. 

2. Iterate through the expression. For each character in the expression:

   a. If the character is an opening bracket (i.e., it's one of "{[("), push it onto the stack. 

   b. If the character is a closing bracket (i.e., it's one of "}])"), check if the top of the stack is a matching opening bracket. If it is, pop the opening bracket off the stack. If it's not, return False, as this indicates an unbalanced expression. 

   c. If the character is not a bracket, do nothing and move on to the next character. 

3. After iterating through the entire expression, check if the stack is empty. If it is, the expression is balanced and the function should return True. Otherwise, the expression is unbalanced and the function should return False. 

Here's a Python implementation of the solution:

```python
def check_expression(expression):
    stack = []
    for char in expression:
        if char in "{[(":
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in "}])":
            if not stack or stack.pop() != "(" + char:
                return False
    return not stack
```

You can use the `assert` statement to test the function. For example:

```python
assert check_expression("{()}[{}]") == True
```

This assertion will pass if the `check_expression` function correctly identifies the given expression as balanced.

To test other expressions, you can simply call the `check_expression` function with the desired expression as an argument.

For example, to check if the expression "([{}])" is balanced, you can use the following code:

```python
print(check_expression("([{}])"))  # Returns: True
```

This will output True if the expression is balanced, and False otherwise.

```
