To solve this problem, we can use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets we encounter. When we encounter a closing bracket, we check if the top of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket. If it is not the case, then the expression is not balanced. If it is, then we pop the top of the stack, as we have encountered a correctly matched pair of brackets. We continue this process until we have checked all brackets in the expression. If, at the end, the stack is empty, the expression is balanced. Otherwise, it is not balanced.

Here is a Python solution for this problem:

def check_expression(expr):
    stack = []
    opening_brackets = ["(", "{", "["]
    closing_brackets = [")", "}", "]"]

    for char in expr:
        if char in opening_brackets:
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in closing_brackets:
            if opening_brackets.index(stack.pop()) != closing_brackets.index(char):
                return False
    return len(stack) == 0

We can use the above function to check if the given expression is balanced or not. For example, if we call check_expression("{()}[{}]", the function will return True because the expression is balanced.

check_expression("{()}[{}]") # True

To check if the given expression is balanced, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize an empty stack to keep track of the opening brackets.
2. Define the opening and closing brackets as a list of characters. For example, opening_brackets = ["(", "{", "["] and closing_brackets = [")", "}", "]"].
3. Iterate through each character in the expression. If the character is an opening bracket, push it onto the stack. If the character is a closing bracket, pop the top of the stack and compare it with the closing bracket. If they are not a matching pair, return False, indicating that the expression is not balanced. If they are a matching pair, continue to the next character.
4. After iterating through all characters in the expression, check if the stack is empty. If
