To check if the expression is balanced, we can use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets and match them with the closing brackets. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. Initialize an empty stack to store opening brackets.
2. Iterate through each character in the expression.
3. If the character is an opening bracket (i.e., '{', '(', or '['), push it onto the stack.
4. If the character is a closing bracket (i.e., '}', ')', or ']'), pop the top opening bracket from the stack. If the opening bracket doesn't match the closing bracket, return False.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until all characters in the expression are processed.
6. If the stack is empty at the end, it means all opening brackets have been matched with closing brackets, and return True. Otherwise, return False.

Here's an example implementation in Python:

```python
def check_expression(expr):
    stack = []
    opening_brackets = {'{', '(', '['}
    closing_brackets = {'}', ')', ']'}

    for char in expr:
        if char in opening_brackets:
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in closing_brackets:
            if stack and stack.pop() not in closing_brackets:
                return False
    return len(stack) == 0
```

You can test the function with the example expression "{()}[{}]" by calling `check_expression("{()}[{}]")`, which should return True.
