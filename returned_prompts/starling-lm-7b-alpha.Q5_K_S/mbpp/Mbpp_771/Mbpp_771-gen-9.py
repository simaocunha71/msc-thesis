Explanation:
This function works by maintaining a stack and iterating through each character in the expression.

For each open parentheses encountered ("(", "{", "["), the corresponding closing parentheses is pushed onto the stack.

For each closing parentheses encountered (")", "}", "]"), if the stack is empty or the closing parentheses does not match the top of the stack, the expression is invalid and False is returned. If the closing parentheses matches the top of the stack, it is popped from the stack.

If the stack is not empty at the end of iterating through the expression, it means there are unmatched opening parentheses, and False is returned.

If the stack is empty at the end of iterating through the expression, it means all opening parentheses have been matched and closed, and True is returned.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the expression.

The space complexity of this function is O(n), as the size of the stack can be at most n in the worst case, when all opening parentheses are unmatched.

This function can be used to check if a given expression is balanced or not.

Example usage:
```python
print(check_expression("{()}[{}]"))  # Output: True
print(check_expression("{()}[{}"))  # Output: False
print(check_expression("([{}])"))  # Output: True
print(check_expression("([{}"))
