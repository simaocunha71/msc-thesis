"""
In this solution, we define a function called division_elements that takes in two tuples as input parameters. Inside the function, we initialize an empty list called result. We then iterate over the range of the length of the first tuple using a for loop.

For each iteration, we perform element-wise division by dividing the corresponding elements of the two tuples. The result is appended to the result list. After the loop finishes, we convert the result list back to a tuple using the tuple() function and return it as the output of the function.

To test the function, we use the assert statement to check if the result of the function call division_elements((10, 4, 6, 9),(5, 2, 3, 3)) is equal to the expected output (2, 2, 2, 3). If the assertion is true, the program will print True, indicating that the function is working correctly.

This code defines a function called `division_elements` that takes in two tuples as input parameters. The function performs element-wise division of the corresponding elements in the tuples and returns the result as a tuple. The assert statement is used to verify the correctness
