"""
Explanation:
The provided code defines a function called `division_elements` that takes in two tuples, `t1` and `t2`. Inside the function, the tuples are converted into lists, `l1` and `l2`, respectively.

A while loop is used to iterate through the elements of `l1`. In each iteration, the element at index `i` in `l1` is divided by the element at the same index in `l2`. The result is stored back in `l1`.

Finally, the function returns a tuple created from `l1`.

In the example usage, the function is called with the tuples `(10, 4, 6, 9)` and `(5, 2, 3, 3)`. The result, `(2, 2, 2, 3)`, is printed to the console.

To test the function, you can use the `assert` statement to check if the function returns the expected result. In this case, the `assert` statement is used to verify that the `division_elements` function correctly performs element-wise mathematical division on the provided tuples.

Here's an explanation of the `assert` statement in the provided code:

The `assert` statement is used to test a condition. If the condition is `True`, the program continues to execute normally. If the condition is `False`, an error message is raised, and the program execution stops.

In this case, the condition being tested is `division_elements((10, 4, 6, 9),(5,
