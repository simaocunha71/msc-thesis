def word_len(word):
    return word.__len__() % 2 == 0

# This function takes a string as an argument and returns a boolean value.
# True if the length of the string is even, False if it is odd.

# The function uses the built-in __len__ method to calculate the length of the string.
# The modulo operator % calculates the remainder of the division of the length by 2.
# If the remainder is 0, the length is even. Otherwise, it is odd.

# Note that this function does not check if the input is a string. It is assumed that the input is a string.
