"""
In this function, I first calculate the length of the input word using the len() function. Then, I use the modulo operator to calculate the remainder when the length of the word is divided by 2. If the remainder is 0, it means the length of the word is even, so I return True. Otherwise, if the remainder is not 0, it means the length of the word is odd, so I return False.
