To find the common elements in given nested lists you can follow the steps below:

1. Create an empty set to store the common elements.
2. Iterate through each nested list.
3. For each nested list, iterate through each element.
4. Add each element to the set.
5. After iterating through all the nested lists, the set will contain all the unique common elements.

Here's a Python function that implements these steps:

```python
def common_in_nested_lists(nested_list):
    """
    Finds the common elements in the given nested lists.

    :param nested_list: List of nested lists.
    :return: Set of common elements.
    """
    common_elements = set()

    for sublist in nested_list:
        for element in sublist:
            common_elements.add(element)

    return common_elements
```

You can use this function to find the common elements in the given nested list:

```python
nested_list = [[12, 18, 23, 25, 45], [7, 12, 18, 24, 28], [1, 5, 8, 12, 15, 16, 18]]
common_elements = common_in_nested_lists(nested_list)
print(common_elements)  # Output: {12, 18}
```
The function will return a set containing the common elements 12 and 18.

Note: This function assumes that the common elements are integers. If the common elements can be of any type, you can modify the function to handle other types as well.

Additionally, the function does not consider the order of elements and will return the common elements as a set, which is an unordered collection of unique elements.
