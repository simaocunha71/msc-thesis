The above function takes a list of lists as input and returns a set containing the common elements in those lists.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the function:

1. Initialize an empty list called `result` to store the common elements.
2. Iterate over each list `l` in the input `lists`.
3. Add each element in `l` to the `result` list using the `+=` operator.
4. After the loop, convert the `result` list to a set using the `set()` function. This removes any duplicate elements and returns a set.
5. Finally, the function returns the set of common elements.

The second version of the function uses a generator expression to directly generate the set of common elements without the need for an intermediate list. This makes the code more concise and efficient.

To test the function, you can use the `assert` statement to check if the set of common elements matches the expected result. In this case, the expected result is `set([18, 12])`.

You can use this function to find the common elements in nested lists by passing the nested lists as an argument to the function. The function will return a set containing the common elements.

Here's an example usage of the function:

```python
nested_lists = [[12, 18, 23, 25, 45], [7, 12, 18, 24, 28], [1, 5, 8, 12, 15, 16, 18]]
common_elements = common_in_nested_lists(nested_lists)
print(common_elements)  # Output: {18, 12}
```

In this example, the nested lists `[[12, 18, 23, 25, 45], [7, 12, 18, 24, 28
