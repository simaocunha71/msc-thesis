"""
To solve this problem, first, we need to flatten the nested list. Then we can find the common elements easily. Here's the step by step solution:

Step 1: Define a function called `common_in_nested_lists` that takes in a nested list as a parameter.

Step 2: Inside the function, define another function called `flatten_list` that takes in a list as a parameter and returns the flattened version of the list. This can be done by recursively iterating through the list and appending each item to a new list. If an item is itself a list, the function should be called again with that sub-list. Here's an example implementation:

```python
def flatten_list(lst):
    flat_list = []
    for item in lst:
        if isinstance(item, list):
            flat_list.extend(flatten_list(item))
        else:
            flat_list.append(item)
    return flat_list
```

Step 3: Call the `flatten_list` function with the nested list passed into the `common_in_nested_lists` function as an argument. This will give you a flattened version of the nested list.

Step 4: Use the `set` function to convert the flattened list into a set. This will remove any duplicate elements.

Step 5: Return the set of unique elements from the flattened list.

Here's the complete solution:

```python
def common_in_nested_lists(nested_list):
    def flatten_list(lst):
        flat_list = []
        for item in lst:
            if isinstance(item, list):
                flat_list.extend(flatten_list(item))
            else:
                flat_list.append(item)
        return flat_list

    flattened_list = flatten_list(nested_list)
    unique_elements = set(flattened_list)
    return unique_elements
```

You can test this solution by calling the `common_in_nested_lists` function with a nested list as an argument. The function will return a set of unique elements that are present in the nested list
