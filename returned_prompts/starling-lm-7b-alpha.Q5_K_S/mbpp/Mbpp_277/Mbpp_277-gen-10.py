```
def dict_filter(d,n):
    new_d={}
    for i in d:
        if d[i]>=n:
            new_d[i]=d[i]
    return new_d
```

In this function, we create a new dictionary called `new_d`. We iterate through the given dictionary `d` and check if the value of each entry is greater than or equal to `n`. If the condition is met, we add the entry to `new_d`. Finally, we return `new_d` as the filtered dictionary.

To test the function, you can use the provided `assert` statement. The assertion checks if the function returns the expected result when given the dictionary `{'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Kierra Gentry': 165, 'Pierre Cox': 190}` and the integer `170`.

The expected output of the function for this input is `{'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Pierre Cox': 190}`. The assertion verifies that the function returns the correct result.

You can run the code to see if the assertion passes and confirm the functionality of the `dict_filter` function.

In the provided solution, the function `dict_filter` is defined with two parameters: `d` (the input dictionary) and `n` (the threshold value). The function creates a new dictionary `new_d` to store the filtered entries. It iterates through each key-value pair in `d` using a `for` loop. For each pair, it checks if the value is greater than or equal to `n`. If it is, the key-value pair is added to `new_d` using dictionary assignment syntax (`new_d[i]=d[i]`). Finally, the function returns `new_d`, which contains only the entries with values greater than or equal to `n`.

By using this function, you can easily filter a dictionary based on a specific threshold value.

It's worth noting that the function name `dict_filter` is descriptive and indicates its purpose, making it easier to understand and use in the context
