```
def dict_filter(dictionary, n):
    return {k: v for k, v in dictionary.items() if v >= n}
```

Explanation:
The function dict_filter takes in a dictionary and an integer n as parameters. It uses a dictionary comprehension to filter the dictionary and only include entries with values greater than or equal to n. The comprehension iterates over the key-value pairs in the dictionary, and checks if the value is greater than or equal to n. If the condition is true, the key-value pair is included in the new dictionary. Finally, the function returns the filtered dictionary.

To test the function, the assert statement is used to check if the function returns the expected result for the given example. The function dict_filter is called with the dictionary {'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Kierra Gentry': 165, 'Pierre Cox': 190} and the integer 170. The expected result is {'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Pierre Cox': 190}. The assert statement verifies if the function's output matches the expected result.

Overall, the provided code defines the function dict_filter that filters a dictionary based on a given integer threshold, and the assert statement tests the function's correctness.

```python
def dict_filter(dictionary, n):
    return {k: v for k, v in dictionary.items() if v >= n}
```

This code defines a function called `dict_filter` that takes in two parameters: `dictionary` and `n`. The function uses a dictionary comprehension to filter the `dictionary` based on the value of each key-value pair. The comprehension iterates over each key-value pair in the `dictionary`, and checks if the value is greater than or equal to `n`. If the condition is true, the key-value pair is included in the new dictionary. Finally, the function returns the filtered dictionary. 

The provided function correctly filters the `dictionary` based on the value of `n`, as tested by the assert statement. 

To use the function, you can call it with a dictionary and
