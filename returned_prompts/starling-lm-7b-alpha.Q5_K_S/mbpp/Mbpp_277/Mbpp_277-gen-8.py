```
def dict_filter(dictionary,n):
    new_dictionary={}
    for i in dictionary:
        if dictionary[i]>=n:
            new_dictionary[i]=dictionary[i]
    return new_dictionary
```

In this code, a function called `dict_filter` is defined. This function takes in two parameters: a dictionary and an integer `n`. The function then creates a new dictionary called `new_dictionary` to store the key-value pairs from the original dictionary that have values greater than or equal to `n`. 

To accomplish this, the function iterates over each key in the original dictionary using a `for` loop. Inside the loop, it checks if the value associated with the current key is greater than or equal to `n`. If it is, the key-value pair is added to the `new_dictionary`. 

Finally, the function returns the `new_dictionary` containing only the key-value pairs with values greater than or equal to `n`. 

To test the function, the provided assertion is used. It asserts that when the `dict_filter` function is called with the dictionary `{'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Kierra Gentry': 165, 'Pierre Cox': 190}` and the integer `170`, the returned value should be `{'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Pierre Cox': 190}`. 

This means that the function correctly filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to `n`.

Note: The code assumes that the input dictionary is a dictionary (i.e., a collection of key-value pairs) and that the value associated with each key is an integer.

Also note that the `assert` keyword in Python is used to check if a condition holds true. If the condition does not hold true, an `AssertionError` is raised. In this case, the `assert` statement is used to verify that the `dict_filter` function returns the expected result when called with the provided dictionary and integer.
