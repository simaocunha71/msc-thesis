def dict_filter(d,n):
  new_d = {}
  for key,value in d.items():
    if value >= n:
      new_d[key] = value
  return new_d
```

dict_filter({'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Kierra Gentry': 165, 'Pierre Cox': 190},170)=={'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Pierre Cox': 190}

To solve this problem, we define a function called `dict_filter` that takes in two parameters: `d`, which is the dictionary to be filtered, and `n`, which is the integer value to filter by. 

Inside the function, we create a new dictionary called `new_d` to store the filtered entries. We then iterate over the key-value pairs in the input dictionary using the `items()` method. For each pair, we check if the value is greater than or equal to the integer `n`. If it is, we add the key-value pair to the `new_d` dictionary using the same key. 

Finally, we return the `new_d` dictionary, which contains only the entries with values greater than or equal to `n`. 

To verify the correctness of the `dict_filter` function, we use an assertion statement to check if the function returns the expected result when given the example dictionary and integer provided in the problem statement. 

In this case, the assertion should pass, as the `dict_filter` function correctly filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to 170, resulting in the expected output: `{'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Pierre Cox': 190}`.

Overall, the solution effectively filters the dictionary based on the given criteria, ensuring that only entries with values greater than or equal to the specified integer are included in the output dictionary.
