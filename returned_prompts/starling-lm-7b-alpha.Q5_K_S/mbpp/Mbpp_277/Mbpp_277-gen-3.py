def dict_filter(dictionary, n):
    return {key: value for key, value in dictionary.items() if value >= n}
```

Explanation:
The function `dict_filter` takes in a dictionary and an integer `n`. It uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary that only includes the key-value pairs from the original dictionary where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. The function then returns this new dictionary.

For example, when `dict_filter({'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Kierra Gentry': 165, 'Pierre Cox': 190},170)` is called, it will filter the dictionary to only include the entries with values greater than or equal to 170. In this case, it will return `{'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Pierre Cox': 190}` as expected.

This function is useful when you want to remove entries from a dictionary based on a certain condition, such as having a value less than a certain threshold.

Overall, the function `dict_filter` provides a concise and efficient way to filter a dictionary based on a given condition.

Here are some additional tips for using this function:
- Make sure the input dictionary is a valid dictionary with key-value pairs.
- Ensure that the value of `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0.
- The function will return an empty dictionary if there are no entries in the original dictionary that satisfy the condition.

Here are some potential error cases to consider:
- If the input dictionary is not a valid dictionary, the function may raise a `TypeError`.
- If the value of `n` is not an integer, the function may raise a `TypeError`.
- If the value of `n` is less than 0, the function may not return the expected result.

To avoid these errors, it's important to validate the input and ensure that the conditions are met before calling the function.
