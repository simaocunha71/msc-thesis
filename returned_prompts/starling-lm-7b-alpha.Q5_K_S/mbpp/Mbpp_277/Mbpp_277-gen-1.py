"""
The function dict_filter defines a function that takes in a dictionary and an integer n. It uses a dictionary comprehension to filter the dictionary and only include entries with values greater than or equal to n. The comprehension iterates over each key-value pair in the dictionary and checks if the value is greater than or equal to n. If it is, it includes the key-value pair in the new dictionary that is returned.

The function is tested by calling it with the provided dictionary and integer n. The expected output is {'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Pierre Cox': 190}, which is a dictionary that only includes the entries with values greater than or equal to 170.
