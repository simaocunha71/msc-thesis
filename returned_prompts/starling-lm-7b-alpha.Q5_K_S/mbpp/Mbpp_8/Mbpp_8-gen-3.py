"""
Explanation:
The function square_nums takes in a list of numbers, nums, as an input. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element in the input list, nums. For each element in the list, it squares the number by multiplying it by itself, num ** 2. The result of squaring each element is stored in a new list, which is then returned by the function. The assert statement checks if the function correctly squares the numbers in the provided list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] and verifies that the output is [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100].
"""

"""
To test the function, you can call it with a list of numbers as an argument, like this:
print(square_nums([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]))
This will print the squares of the numbers in the list, which in this case is [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100].
"""

"""
The assert statement is used to check if the function correctly squares the numbers in the provided list. If the assert statement fails, it means that the function is not working correctly and an error message will be raised. However, in this case, the assert statement passes, indicating that the function is correctly squaring the numbers in the list.
