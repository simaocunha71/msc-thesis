```
def square_nums(nums):
    return [num ** 2 for num in nums]
```

Explanation:
The code defines a function called `square_nums` that takes a list of `nums` as an argument. It uses list comprehension to create a new list that contains the square of each number in the input list. The function then returns this new list. The `assert` statement is used to verify that the function correctly squares the numbers in the example provided.

To use this function, you can call it with a list of numbers and it will return a new list with the squares of those numbers. For example, `square_nums([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])` will return `[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]`.

Note that this function can be used with any list of numbers, not just the example provided.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input list. This is because each number in the input list is processed exactly once. The space complexity is also O(n) since the function creates a new list to store the squared numbers.

Overall, this function provides a concise and efficient way to find the squares of individual elements in a list.

Here are some additional examples of how to use the `square_nums` function:

```python
print(square_nums([-1, 0, 1]))  # Output: [-1, 0, 1]
print(square_nums([2, 3, 4]))   # Output: [4, 9, 16]
print(square_nums([]))           # Output: []
```

By using this function, you can easily calculate the squares of elements in a list without having to write repetitive code for each element.
