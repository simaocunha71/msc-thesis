# Code Explanation
In the above function, we are taking three lists and merging them into a single list. Then we are using the built-in sort() function to sort the merged list in ascending order.

"""
The built-in sort() function sorts the elements of the list in ascending order. It rearranges the elements in-place, which means that the original list is modified. The function does not return a new sorted list, but instead modifies the original list.
"""

After merging and sorting, we are returning the merged and sorted list.

This function can be used to merge and sort any number of lists, not just three. You can pass as many lists as you want as arguments to the function, and they will all be merged and sorted into a single list.

"""
For example, if you wanted to merge and sort four lists, you could call the function like this: merge_sorted_list(list1, list2, list3, list4)
"""

In the provided assert statement, we are testing the function with three lists, and checking if the output matches the expected result. The test passes if the output is the same as the expected result.

"""
The print("Test Passed") statement is printed if the test passes, indicating that the function
