In this solution, we use the is_polite function to check if a number is polite or not. Then we use a while loop to find the nth polite number. In the while loop, we increment the num variable by 1 in each iteration. If the current number is polite, we increment the cnt variable by 1. We repeat this process until cnt is equal to n. Finally, we return the num - 1, as the nth polite number is the number that is counted in the process.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), as we need to check each number from 1 to n to find the nth polite number. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a fixed number of variables in the solution.

To test the solution, we use the assert statement to check if the is_polite function returns True for the number 7. This is to verify that the is_polite function is correctly implemented. Then we call the nth_polite_number function with the argument 10 to find the 10th polite number. Finally, we print the result to the console.

The expected output is 21, as the 10th polite number is 21.

Here is the code for the solution:
