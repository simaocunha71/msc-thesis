def replace_blank(s,c):
  return s.replace(" ",""+c)

# This code defines a function called `replace_blank` that takes in two parameters: `s` (the original string) and `c` (the character to replace the blank spaces with). The function uses the `replace()` method to replace all instances of a blank space in the string with the specified character, and then returns the modified string.

# The provided assertion tests the `replace_blank` function by passing in the string "hello people" and the character '@' as arguments. The expected output is "hello@people", as all blank spaces in the string are replaced with '@'.

# Running this code will output `True`, confirming that the `replace_blank` function is correctly replacing blank spaces with the specified character.

# Here's an example usage of the `replace_blank` function:

# `replace_blank("Hello world!", "*")`
# Output: "Hello*world!"

# This code will replace all blank spaces in the string "Hello world!" with the character '*', resulting in the modified string "Hello*world!".

# You can use the `replace_blank` function in your own code to replace blank spaces with any character you desire, by passing in the appropriate arguments.

# This problem can also be solved using other methods, such as using string concatenation or list comprehension. However, the `replace()` method is a built-in Python function specifically designed for this purpose, making it the most efficient and readable solution.

# Additionally, it's worth noting that the `replace()` method is case-sensitive. If you want to replace both uppercase and lowercase blank spaces, you can pass in the `replaces` argument as an empty string ('') to remove them entirely. For example:

# `replace_blank("Hello, World!", "")`
# Output: "Hello,World!"

# In this case, all blank spaces in the string are removed, resulting in the modified string "Hello,World!".

# Overall, the `replace_blank` function provides a straightforward and efficient way to replace blank spaces with a specified character in a given string.

# It's important to ensure that the input string and character are valid and correctly formatted, as the
