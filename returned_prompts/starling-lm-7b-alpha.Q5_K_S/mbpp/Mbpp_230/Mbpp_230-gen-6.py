"""
Here is a simple solution to your problem:

def replace_blank(string, character):
    return string.replace(' ' , character)

And for your assert statement, it's working as expected:

print(replace_blank("hello people",'@'))  # Output: "hello@people"
"""

Here's a Python function that replaces blank spaces in the given string with the specified character, and returns the modified string:

```python
def replace_blank(string, character):
    return string.replace(' ' , character)
```

To verify the correctness of the function, you can use the following assert statement:

```python
assert replace_blank("hello people",'@')=="hello@people"
```

This assert statement checks if the function correctly replaces all blank spaces in the string "hello people" with the character '@', and returns the modified string "hello@people".

By executing `print(replace_blank("hello people",'@'))`, the function will be invoked with the provided arguments, and the result will be displayed as "hello@people".

This solution should fulfill your requirements and provide the expected output.
