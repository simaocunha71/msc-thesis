Write a function that takes in a string and a list of characters, and returns the index of the first character that is not in the list, if it exists.
If all characters are in the list, the function should return -1.

Write a function that takes in a string, and returns the length of the longest substring that is a palindrome.
For example, if the input is "babad", the function should return 3 because the longest palindromic substring is "bab".
If there are multiple palindromes of equal length, the function should return the length of any of them.

Write a function that takes in a string and a dictionary of characters and their replacement values.
The function should return a new string where each character in the original string is replaced by the corresponding value from the dictionary.
