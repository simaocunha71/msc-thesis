# Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string.
# Space Complexity: O(1), as the string is modified in-place and no extra space is used.

# Here, the time complexity is dominated by the time taken by the replace() function, which is linear in the length of the string.
# The space complexity is O(1) because no extra space is used and the string is modified in-place.

# The replace() method creates a new string and returns it. It does not modify the original string.

# The replace() method is not considered in the time complexity calculation because it is a built-in function and its implementation is not known. However, it is known that the replace() method has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string to be replaced.

# The space complexity is O(1) because no extra space is used and the string is modified in-place.
# The replace() method is not considered in the space complexity calculation because it is a built-in function and its implementation is not known. However, it is known that the replace() method does not use any extra space and modifies the original string in-place.
