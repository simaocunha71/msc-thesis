"""
Here's an example of how to use the function:

capital_words_spaces("Python")  # Returns 'Python'
capital_words_spaces("GPT")  # Returns ' GPT'
capital_words_spaces("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog")  # Returns 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'
"""

# This function adds spaces between words starting with capital letters in a given string
# It iterates through the string and checks if the current character is the first character of a word or if the previous character is a space
# If it's the first character of a word, it appends the character to the result string
# If it's not the first character of a word and the previous character is a space, it appends a space followed by the character to the result string
# Finally, it returns the result string with spaces between capitalized words

# The function can be used to format strings with spaces between capitalized words, which can be useful for improving readability

# Note: The function assumes that the input string only contains alphanumeric characters and spaces, and that the first character of each word is a capital letter
# If the input string contains other characters or if the assumption about the capitalization of the first character of each word is incorrect, the function may produce incorrect results

# Here are some additional examples of how to use the function:

# capital_words_spaces("Hello World")
