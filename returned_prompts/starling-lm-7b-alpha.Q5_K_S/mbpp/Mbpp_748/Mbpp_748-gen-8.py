"""
For the given string "Python", all three functions return the same result "Python".

"""
The time complexity of all three functions is O(n) as they traverse the string once. The space complexity of all three functions is O(1) as they don't require any additional space that grows with the input size.

"""
For the string "Python", the first function capital_words_spaces takes 3 steps:
1. It replaces the first character with its lower case version.
2. It returns the updated string.

The second function capital_words_spaces takes 5 steps:
1. It splits the string into a list of words.
2. It checks each word to see if the first character is uppercase.
3. If the first character is uppercase, it appends a space followed by the word to a new list.
4. It joins the new list of words with spaces in between into a string.
5. It returns the updated string.

The third function capital_words_spaces_regex takes 3 steps:
1. It uses a regular expression to find all words starting with an uppercase letter in the string.
2. It replaces each word starting with an uppercase letter with the same word followed by a space.
3. It returns
