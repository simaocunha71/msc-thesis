```
def larg_nnum(num_list,n):
    num_list.sort(reverse=True)
    return num_list[:n]
```

In this function, we first sort the num_list in reverse order. This will place the largest number at the beginning of the list. Then we return the first n elements of the list, which are the n largest numbers in the original list.

The assert statement verifies that when we call the function with the list [10, 20, 50, 70, 90, 20, 50, 40, 60, 80, 100] and n=2, the result is [100, 90], which are indeed the two largest numbers in the list.
