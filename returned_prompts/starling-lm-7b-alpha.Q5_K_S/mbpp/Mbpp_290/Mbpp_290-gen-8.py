"""
This code defines a function called max_length that takes a list of lists as input and returns a tuple containing the maximum length found and the list with the maximum length. 

The function initializes two variables, max_len and max_list, to keep track of the maximum length and the list with the maximum length, respectively. 

Then, it iterates over each list in the input list using a for loop. For each list, it compares the length of the list with the current maximum length. If the length of the list is greater than the current maximum length, it updates the max_len and max_list variables to store the new maximum length and the corresponding list. 

Finally, it returns the maximum length and the list with the maximum length as a tuple. 

The assert statement at the end of the code tests the function with a sample input and checks if the returned value is correct. If the assertion passes, it prints "All tests passed." Otherwise, an error message is raised.
