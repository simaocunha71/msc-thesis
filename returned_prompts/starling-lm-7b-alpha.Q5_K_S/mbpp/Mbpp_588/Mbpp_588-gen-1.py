Here's one way to do it:

```python
def big_diff(lst):
    return max(lst)-min(lst)
```

To test it out, you can call the function with a list as an argument like this:

```python
print(big_diff([1,2,3,4])) # prints 3
```

This function works by first finding the maximum value in the list using the `max()` function, and then finding the minimum value using the `min()` function. It then subtracts the minimum value from the maximum value, and returns the result.

Note: This function assumes that the list contains at least one element. If the list is empty, it will raise a `ValueError`.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the code:

```python
def big_diff(lst): # define the function
    return max(lst)-min(lst) # return the difference between the maximum and minimum value in the list
```

To test the function, you can call it with a list as an argument, like this:

```python
print(big_diff([1,2,3,4])) # prints 3
```

This will print the result of the function call, which in this case is 3, the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `[1,2,3,4]`.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.
