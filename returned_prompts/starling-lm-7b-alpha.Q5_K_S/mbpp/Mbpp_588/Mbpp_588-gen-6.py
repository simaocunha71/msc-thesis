```
def big_diff(lst):
    if lst == []:
        return 0
    else:
        return max(lst) - min(lst)
```

Explanation:

This function, `big_diff`, takes a list `lst` as input and returns the difference between the largest and smallest values in the list. 

Here's how it works:
1. The function first checks if the input list `lst` is empty. If it is, it means there are no elements in the list, so the function simply returns `0` as there is no difference between the largest and smallest values in an empty list.
2. If the list is not empty, the function proceeds to find the largest and smallest values in the list. It does this by using the built-in `max()` and `min()` functions, which return the maximum and minimum values in a list, respectively.
3. Once the largest and smallest values are found, the function returns the difference between them, which is calculated by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value using the expression `max(lst) - min(lst)`. 

To test the function, an `assert` statement is used to check if the function correctly calculates the difference between the largest and smallest values in a sample list `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The expected output is `3`, which is the difference between the maximum value (`4`) and the minimum value (`1`) in the list.

Overall, the `big_diff` function provides a concise and efficient solution to finding the difference between the largest and smallest values in a given list.

Here's an example of how to use the `big_diff` function:

```python
print(big_diff([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: 3
print(big_diff([5, 10, 15, 20]))  # Output: 15
print(big_diff([]))  # Output: 0
```

In each example, the `big_diff` function correctly calculates and returns the difference between the largest and smallest values in the provided list.

Note: The `assert` statement is a debugging tool used to check if a certain condition is true
