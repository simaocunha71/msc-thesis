def big_diff(lst):
    return max(lst)-min(lst)
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list. The `max()` function returns the largest value in the list, while the `min()` function returns the smallest value. By subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value, we obtain the desired difference.

To use this function, you can simply call it with your desired list of numbers as an argument, like this:
```python
big_diff([1,2,3,4])  # Returns 3
```
In this example, the function is called with the list `[1,2,3,4]`, and it will return `3`, which is the difference between the maximum value (`4`) and the minimum value (`1`) in the list.

This function can be used to find the difference between the largest and smallest values in any list of numbers, regardless of its size or the specific values it contains.
