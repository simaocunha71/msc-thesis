# One pointer starts from the start and the other from the end,
# and swaps the numbers until they meet.

# This solution has a time complexity of O(n),
# where n is the number of elements in the list.
# It is much faster than the previous solution, which has a time complexity of O(n^2).

# Here is a test case:
assert move_zero([1,0,2,0,3,4]) == [1,2,3,4,0,0]
print("All tests passed.")

# Note:
# The move_zero function does not modify the original list,
# but instead returns a new list with all zeroes moved to the end.
# The move_zero_efficient function, however, modifies the original list in place.
