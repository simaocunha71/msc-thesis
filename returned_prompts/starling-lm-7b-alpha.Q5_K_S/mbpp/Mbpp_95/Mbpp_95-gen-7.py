In this solution, the function Find_Min_Length takes a list of lists as an argument. The variable min_length is initialized as the length of the first list in the input list. Then, a for loop iterates over each list in the input list. Inside the loop, the length of the current list is compared to min_length. If the length of the current list is smaller than min_length, min_length is updated to the length of the current list. Finally, the function returns the minimum length found.

To test the function, the assert statement is used to check if the function returns the correct result for the given example, i.e., [1] and [1, 2]. The expected output is 1, which is the length of the smallest list in the input list.

Overall, this solution provides an efficient way to find the length of the smallest list in a list of lists using Python.

Here are some additional notes:

- The function uses a for loop to iterate over each list in the input list.
- The length of each list is compared to the current min_length value.
- If a smaller length is found, min_length is updated.
- The function returns the minimum length found.
- The assert statement is used to test the function with a specific example and check if the expected output is correct.

This solution can be used as a reference for finding the length of the smallest list in a list of lists in Python.

Additionally, here are some related Python functions that can be helpful in similar scenarios:

- Python's built-in min() function can be used to find the minimum value in a list. For example, min([1, 2, 3]) returns 1.
- Python's built-in max() function can be used to find the maximum value in a list. For example, max([1, 2, 3]) returns 3.
- Python's built-in len() function can be used to find the length of a list
