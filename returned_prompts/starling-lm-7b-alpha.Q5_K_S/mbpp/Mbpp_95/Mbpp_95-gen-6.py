Here's one way you might write the function:

```python
def Find_Min_Length(L):
    """Returns the length of the smallest list in a list of lists."""
    # Initialize the length of the smallest list
    min_length = len(L[0])
    # Iterate through all the lists in the list of lists
    for l in L:
        # If the length of the current list is smaller than min_length
        if len(l) < min_length:
            # Assign the length of the current list to min_length
            min_length = len(l)
    # Return the length of the smallest list
    return min_length
```

Here's how it works:

- The function `Find_Min_Length(L)` takes in a single argument, `L`, which is a list of lists.
- It initializes the variable `min_length` to the length of the first list in the input list, `L`.
- Then it loops through each list in the list of lists, `L`.
- For each list, it compares the length of the current list to the current value of `min_length`.
- If the length of the current list is smaller than `min_length`, it updates `min_length` to the length of the current list.
- After looping through all the lists, the function returns the final value of `min_length`.
- In other words, the function iteratively finds the length of the smallest list in the list of lists.

The assertion `assert Find_Min_Length([[1],[1,2]]) == 1` checks that the function correctly returns the length of the smallest list in the input list `[[1],[1,2]]`, which is 1.
