"""
In this script, we define a function called remove_odd which takes one argument l (the list). This function returns a new list, which is a subset of l that only contains even numbers. This is achieved using list comprehension, a concise way to create a new list based on an existing one. The list comprehension iterates over the elements in l, and only includes the elements in the new list if the element is even (i.e. if the element modulo 2 is equal to 0). The assert statement checks that the function correctly removes odd numbers from a given list, and the print statement demonstrates how to use the function.
"""



"""
The assert statement is used to test if a condition is true. If the condition is not met, an AssertionError is raised with an optional error message. In this case, the condition is that the function remove_odd returns [2] when given the input [1,2,3]. This test ensures that the function correctly identifies and removes odd numbers from a list.

"""
The print statement is used to print the result of the function remove_odd when called with the input [1,2,3]. This demonstrates how to use the function, and allows us to see the result of the function in the output.

"""
In summary, this script defines a function remove_odd that takes a list as an argument and returns a new list containing only even numbers. The function is tested using an assert statement and a print statement, demonstrating how to use the function and showing that it correctly identifies and removes odd numbers from a list.

"""
The assert statement is a control flow statement in Python that checks if a condition is true and if it is not true, it raises an AssertionError. It is used in Python to test if certain conditions are met. In this case, the condition is that the function remove_odd correctly removes odd numbers from the list [1,2,3] and should return [2]. If this condition is not met, an error will be raised.
