```python
def remove_odd(list_odd):
    return [i for i in list_odd if i % 2 == 0]
```

Explanation:
The provided Python function, `remove_odd`, removes odd numbers from a given list. It uses list comprehension to create a new list containing only even numbers. The list comprehension iterates over the input list, `list_odd`, and includes each element `i` in the new list if `i` divided by 2 leaves a remainder of 0 (i.e., if `i` is an even number). The assertion `assert remove_odd([1,2,3]) == [2]` verifies that the function correctly removes the odd number 3 from the input list `[1,2,3]` and returns the even number 2.

Here's how the code works step by step:

1. The function `remove_odd` takes a single parameter, `list_odd`, which represents the input list of numbers.
2. Inside the function, a list comprehension is used to create a new list. The list comprehension iterates over each element `i` in the `list_odd` and checks if the element is divisible by 2 (i.e., if it's an even number) using the condition `i % 2 == 0`.
3. If the condition is true (i.e., if the element is even), it is included in the new list. Otherwise, it is skipped.
4. Finally, the function returns the new list containing only even numbers from the original list.

Overall, this function is a simple and efficient way to remove odd numbers from a given list in Python.

```python
def remove_odd(list_odd):
    return [i for i in list_odd if i % 2 == 0]
```

This code defines a function called `remove_odd` that takes a list of numbers as an argument. The function uses a list comprehension to create a new list that only includes even numbers from the original list. The condition `i % 2 == 0` checks if a number is even (i.e., if it leaves no remainder when divided by 2). The function then returns the new list with only even numbers.
