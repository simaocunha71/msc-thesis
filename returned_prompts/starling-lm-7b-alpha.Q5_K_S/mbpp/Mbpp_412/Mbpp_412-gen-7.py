"""
Explanation:
The function remove_odd takes a list of numbers (nums) as an argument and uses the built-in filter() function to filter out odd numbers from the list. The lambda function inside filter() checks if a number is even by checking if the remainder of the number divided by 2 is equal to 0. The filter() function returns an iterator of only the even numbers from the list. Finally, the list() function is used to convert the iterator back into a list, which is then returned by the function.

The assert statement is used to verify that the function works correctly. It compares the result of calling remove_odd([1,2,3]) with the expected output [2]. If the two values are not equal, the assert statement will raise an AssertionError, indicating that the function is not working as expected. However, in this case, the function correctly removes the odd number 3 from the list, so the assert statement passes and prints "All tests passed" to the console.
