"""
Explanation:
The function `remove_odd` is a Python function that takes in a list of numbers and returns a new list that contains only the even numbers. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list and checks if the number is divisible by 2 (i.e., an even number). If the condition is met, the number is added to the new list. The function then returns the new list.

The assert statement is used to verify that the function is working correctly. In this case, the assert statement checks if the function `remove_odd` correctly removes odd numbers from the input list `[1,2,3]` and returns the expected output `[2]`.

The more tests that are added at the end of the code demonstrate the function's behavior with different input lists. The function correctly removes odd numbers from all input lists, including an empty list.
