def centered_hexagonal_number(n):

Here's a Python function that finds the nth centered hexagonal number. It works by first reducing the index by one (since the first centered hexagonal number is 1) and then using the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers squared and the sum of the first n + 1 natural numbers squared. The result is divided by 3 to get the correct value for the nth centered hexagonal number.

The assert statement checks if the function returns the correct value for the 10th centered hexagonal number (which should be 271).

This solution has a time complexity of O(1) since the formula directly calculates the nth centered hexagonal number without any iteration or recursion.

Here's a Python function that finds the nth centered hexagonal number using a different approach. It works by first reducing the index by one (since the first centered hexagonal number is 1) and then using a loop to calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers squared and the sum of the first n + 1 natural numbers squared. The result is divided by 3 to get the correct value for the nth centered hexagonal number.

The assert statement checks if the function returns the correct value for the 10th centered hexagonal number (which should be 271).

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) since the loop iterates over each natural number from 1 to n (and n + 1) to calculate the sums.

Here's another Python function that finds the nth centered hexagonal number using recursion. It works by first reducing the index by one (since the first centered hexagonal number is 1) and then recursively calculating the sum of the first n natural numbers squared and the sum of the first n + 1 natural numbers squared. The result is divided by 3 to get the correct value for the nth centered hexagonal number.

The assert statement checks if the function returns the correct value for the 10th centered hexagonal number (which should be 271).
