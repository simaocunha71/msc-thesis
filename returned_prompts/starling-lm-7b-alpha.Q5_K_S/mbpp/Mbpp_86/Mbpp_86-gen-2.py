"""
The centered hexagonal number is a centered polygonal number, which is a generalization of the polygonal number. A centered hexagonal number is the sum of the hexagonal numbers up to and including the nth hexagonal number. The first few centered hexagonal numbers are 1, 6, 21, 46, 91, 161, 271, ... (sequence A006588 in OEIS).

For example, the first centered hexagonal number is 1 because there are no hexagonal numbers. The second is 6 because there are two hexagonal numbers (1 and 6). The third is 21 because there are three hexagonal numbers (1, 6, and 11).
