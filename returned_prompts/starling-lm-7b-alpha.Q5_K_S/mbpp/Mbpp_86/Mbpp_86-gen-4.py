def centered_hexagonal_number(n):
    return 2 * (n ** 3) + 2 * (n ** 2) - n
```

Explanation:

In a centered hexagonal number, the first layer consists of 1, the second layer consists of 3, and so on. The nth centered hexagonal number is the sum of the nth triangular number and the (n-1)th triangular number.

The time complexity of this solution is O(1), and the space complexity is O(1).

Here is how the solution works:

1. Define the function `centered_hexagonal_number` that takes an integer `n` as input.
2. Inside the function, calculate the nth centered hexagonal number using the formula `2 * (n ** 3) + 2 * (n ** 2) - n`.
3. Return the result.

To verify the correctness of the solution, we can use the `assert` statement to check if the result of the function `centered_hexagonal_number(10)` is equal to 271, as expected.

This solution provides a concise and efficient way to find the nth centered hexagonal number.

```python
def centered_hexagonal_number(n):
    return 2 * (n ** 3) + 2 * (n ** 2) - n
```

This function uses a mathematical formula to calculate the nth centered hexagonal number. The time complexity of this function is O(1) because it performs a single calculation to find the result. The space complexity is also O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of memory to store the input value `n`.

To use this function, you can simply call it with the desired value of `n`, and it will return the nth centered hexagonal number. For example, to find the 10th centered hexagonal number, you can call `centered_hexagonal_number(10)`. The function will then return the value 271.

You can verify the correctness of this function by using the `assert` statement to check if the result of `centered_hexagonal_number(10)` is equal to 271, as expected.
