def centered_hexagonal_number(n):
    # The centered hexagonal number is a hexagonal number
    # where the first row has one more number than the row below it.
    # The nth centered hexagonal number is the sum of the first n rows
    # of hexagonal numbers, where the nth row has one more number
    # than the previous row.
    # The sum of the first k rows of hexagonal numbers is
    # (k^3 + k) / 6
    # So, the nth centered hexagonal number is
    # (1^3 + 1) / 6 + (2^3 + 2) / 6 + ... + (n^3 + n) / 6
    # = (1 + 2 + ... + n) * (n^2 + n + 2) / 6
    # = (n * (n + 1) * (2n + 1)) / 6
    # = (n * (n + 1) * (2n + 1)) / 6
    return (n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1)) // 6
```

In this solution, we use the formula for the sum of the first k rows of hexagonal numbers to find the nth centered hexagonal number. The sum of the first k rows of hexagonal numbers is (k^3 + k) / 6, so the nth centered hexagonal number is (1^3 + 1) / 6 + (2^3 + 2) / 6 + ... + (n^3 + n) / 6, which simplifies to (n * (n + 1) * (2n + 1)) / 6.

To verify the solution, we can use the assert statement to check if the function returns the correct value for the given input. In this case, assert centered_hexagonal_number(10) == 271 checks if the function correctly calculates the 10th centered hexagonal number as 271.

Overall, this solution provides an efficient and accurate way to find the nth centered hexagonal number using the formula for the sum of the first k rows of hexagonal numbers.
