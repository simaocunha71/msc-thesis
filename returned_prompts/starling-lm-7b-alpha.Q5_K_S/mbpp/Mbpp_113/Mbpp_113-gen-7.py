Here is a possible solution:

```python
def check_integer(s):
    if not s.isdigit():
        return False
    return True
```

Explanation:
The function `check_integer` takes a string `s` as input and checks if all the characters in the string are digits. If all the characters are digits, it returns `True`, indicating that the string represents an integer. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

In the provided solution, the function `check_integer` first checks if the string `s` is not composed of only digits using the `isdigit()` method. If the string is not composed of only digits, it means that the string does not represent an integer, and the function returns `False`. If the string is composed of only digits, the function returns `True`, indicating that the string represents an integer.

The `isdigit()` method is a built-in Python method that returns `True` if all the characters in the string are digits, and `False` otherwise.

This solution is simpler than the one provided in the question and directly checks if the string is composed of only digits, which is the primary requirement for a string to represent an integer.

Note: It's important to mention that this solution does not handle leading zeroes (e.g., "007") or negative integers (e.g., "-5"). If you need to handle these cases, you can modify the code accordingly.
