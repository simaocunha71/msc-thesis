"""
A Perrin number is a number that can be expressed as the sum of two positive integers in exactly one way. For example, 1 is a Perrin number because there is only one way to express it as the sum of two positive integers (i.e. 1 = 1 + 0). There are 10 Perrin numbers less than 100, they are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, and 16. The sum of these numbers is 90.

To calculate the sum of the first n Perrin numbers, you can use the following steps:

1. Create an empty list to store the Perrin numbers.
2. Iterate through all the numbers less than n.
3. Check if a number can be expressed as the sum of two positive integers in exactly one way. If it can, add it to the list of Perrin numbers.
4. Calculate the sum of the Perrin numbers in the list.
5. Return the sum.

Here's the Python code to implement this algorithm:

def cal_sum(n):
    # Step 1: Create an empty list to store the Perrin numbers.
    perrin_numbers = []

    # Step 2: Iterate through all the numbers less than n.
    for i in range(1, n):
        # Step 3: Check if a number can be expressed as the sum of two positive integers in exactly one way. If it can, add it to the list of Perrin numbers.
        if all(i % j != 0 for j in range(1, i)):
            perrin_numbers.append(i)

    # Step 4: Calculate the sum of the Perrin numbers in the list.
    sum_perrin_numbers = sum(perrin_numbers)

    # Step 5: Return the sum.
    return sum_perrin_numbers

# Test the function with an example
assert cal_sum(9) == 49

The function cal_sum(n) takes an integer n as input and returns the sum of the first n Perr
