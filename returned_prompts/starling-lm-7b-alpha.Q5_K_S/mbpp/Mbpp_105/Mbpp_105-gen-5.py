```
def count(arr):
    count=0
    for i in arr:
        if i==True:
            count+=1
    return count
```

Explanation:
The provided code defines a function called `count` that takes in a list as its argument. Inside the function, a variable `count` is initialized to 0. Then, a `for` loop is used to iterate through each element `i` in the input list `arr`. If the element `i` is equal to `True`, the `count` variable is incremented by 1. Finally, the function returns the value of the `count` variable, which represents the number of true booleans in the input list.

To test the function, you can call it with a sample list `[True, False, True]` and assert that the returned value is equal to 2, as expected.

The function can be used to count the number of true booleans in any given list by calling it and passing the list as an argument.

This solution utilizes a simple iteration approach to count the occurrences of true booleans in the list. It does not rely on any built-in Python functions or libraries, making it a straightforward and efficient approach for this specific problem.

It's worth noting that the provided solution assumes that the input list only contains boolean values (`True` and `False`). If the list can contain other types of elements, additional logic would be needed to handle those cases and count only the true booleans.

Overall, this solution provides a clear and concise approach to count the number of true booleans in a given list using Python.

```python
def count(arr):
    count = 0
    for i in arr:
        if i == True:
            count += 1
    return count
```

This function `count` takes a list `arr` as an argument and initializes a variable `count` to 0. It then iterates over each element `i` in the list `arr`. If the element `i` is equal to `True`, the `count` variable is incremented by 1. Finally, the function returns the value of the `count` variable, which represents the number of true booleans in the input list.

To test the function,
