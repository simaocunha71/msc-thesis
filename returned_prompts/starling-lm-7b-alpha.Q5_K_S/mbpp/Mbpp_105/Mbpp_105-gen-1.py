def count(input_list):

```

This function simply iterates through the list and increments a counter if the boolean is true, then returns the counter. 

Here's a breakdown of the code:

- `def count(input_list):` defines a function called `count` that takes one argument, `input_list`.
- `counter = 0` initializes a counter variable to keep track of the number of true booleans found.
- `for i in input_list:` iterates through each element in the `input_list`.
- `if i:` checks if the current element is true (as booleans evaluate to either True or False).
- `counter += 1` increments the counter by 1 if the current element is true.
- `return counter` returns the final value of the counter, which represents the number of true booleans in the list.

The `assert` statement at the beginning of the code is a way to verify that the function works correctly. It checks if the function's output (`count([True,False, True])`) is equal to the expected result (`2`), and if not, it raises an error.

You can use this function to count the number of true booleans in any given list by calling it with the list as an argument. For example, `count([True, False, True])` would return `2`.

```python
def count(input_list):
    counter = 0
    for i in input_list:
        if i:
            counter += 1
    return counter
```

This function counts the number of True values in a list of booleans. Here's a breakdown of the code:
