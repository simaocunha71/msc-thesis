```

In the above question, we are asked to create a function that takes a list of integers as an argument and returns a new list that contains the cube of each integer in the original list. The function we created, cube_nums(), uses a list comprehension to achieve this. The list comprehension iterates over each number in the input list and raises it to the power of 3 to calculate its cube. The resulting cubes are then added to a new list, which is returned as the output of the function.

To test the function, we have included a test case in the code. The test case checks if the output of cube_nums([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) is equal to [1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729, 1000]. If the assertion is true, the message "All tests passed." is printed. Otherwise, an error message is displayed.

By running this code, we can verify that
