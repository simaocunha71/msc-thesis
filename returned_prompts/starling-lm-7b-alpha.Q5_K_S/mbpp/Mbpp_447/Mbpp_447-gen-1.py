```
def cube_nums(nums):
    return [num ** 3 for num in nums]
```

Explanation:
In this task, we are asked to write a function that takes in a list of numbers and returns a new list containing the cube of each number. 

The function `cube_nums` takes in a parameter `nums`, which represents the input list of numbers. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list and raises it to the power of 3 using the exponentiation operator (`**`). The result is a new list containing the cubes of each number in the input list. 

The function is tested using the `assert` statement to verify that it produces the expected output when given the example input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`. 

To use the function, you can simply call it with a list of numbers as an argument, and it will return a new list with the cubes of the input numbers.

Example usage:
```python
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
result = cube_nums(nums)
print(result)  # Output: [1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729, 1000]
```

This will print the list of cubes for the input `nums` using the `cube_nums` function.

Note: The `assert` statement is used here for testing purposes only. It is not necessary to include it in the code if you don't want to perform specific tests.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.

Explanation:
The code defines a function `cube_nums` which takes a list of numbers as an argument. It returns a new list containing the cubes of the individual elements in the input list.
