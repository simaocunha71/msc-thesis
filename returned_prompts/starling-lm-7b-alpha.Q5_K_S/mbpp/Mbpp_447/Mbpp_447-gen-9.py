In the test, the function is called with the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`. The function should return a new list that contains the cube of each number in the original list.

To implement the function, we can use list comprehension. List comprehension provides a concise way to create lists based on existing lists. In this case, we can use `[i**3 for i in nums]` to create a new list where each element is the cube of the corresponding element in the `nums` list.

The function `cube_nums` is then tested by comparing its output with the expected result `[1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729, 1000]`. The `assert` statement is used to check if the function's output matches the expected result. If the function's output is correct, the test will pass and no error message will be displayed. If the function's output is incorrect, an error message will be displayed.
