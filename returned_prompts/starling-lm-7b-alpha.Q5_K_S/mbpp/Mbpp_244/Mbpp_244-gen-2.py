Here is a Python function that finds the next perfect square greater than a given number:

```python
import math

def next_Perfect_Square(n):
    sq_root = math.sqrt(n)
    return int(sq_root + sq_root) ** 2
```

This function works by first finding the square root of the given number `n`. Then it takes the square root and adds it to itself, effectively rounding up to the next whole number. Finally, it squares the rounded up number to get the next perfect square greater than the given number.

For example, if you call `next_Perfect_Square(35)`, the function will calculate the square root of 35, which is approximately 5.916, and round up to the nearest whole number, which is 6. Then it squares 6 to get 36, which is the next perfect square greater than 35.

To use this function, you can call it with a number as an argument. For example, `next_Perfect_Square(35)` will return 36, and `next_Perfect_Square(40)` will return 49.

```python
print(next_Perfect_Square(35))  # Output: 36
print(next_Perfect_Square(40))  # Output: 49
```

The `math.sqrt()` function is used to calculate the square root of a number. It takes a number as an argument and returns its square root as a float. The `int()` function is used to round up the square root to the nearest whole number.

The `**` operator is used to raise a number to a power. In this case, it is used to square the rounded up number.

Overall, this function provides a simple and efficient way to find the next perfect square greater than a given number in Python.

```python
import math

def next_Perfect_Square(n):
    sq_root = math.sqrt(n)
    return int(sq_root + sq_root) ** 2
```

You can use this function to find the next perfect square greater than any given number.
