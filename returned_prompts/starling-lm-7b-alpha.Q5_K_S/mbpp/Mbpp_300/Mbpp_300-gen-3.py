Here is a Python solution:

```python
from math import comb

def count_binary_seq(n):
    return comb(2 * n, n)
```

Explanation:

In a binary sequence of length 2n, the sum of the first n bits and the sum of the last n bits can be either 0 or 1. 

If the sum of the first n bits is 0, then all the first n bits must be 0. If the sum of the first n bits is 1, then at least one of the first n bits must be 1. 

So, the total number of binary sequences of length 2n such that the sum of the first n bits is the same as the sum of the last n bits is the sum of the number of binary sequences with sum 0 and the number of binary sequences with sum 1. 

The number of binary sequences with sum 0 is the number of ways to choose n bits from 2n to be 0, which is comb(2n, n). 

Similarly, the number of binary sequences with sum 1 is the number of ways to choose n bits from 2n to be 1, which is also comb(2n, n). 

Therefore, the total number of binary sequences of length 2n such that the sum of the first n bits is the same as the sum of the last n bits is comb(2n, n). 

The function comb(2n, n) calculates the number of ways to choose n items from a set of 2n distinct items, which is given by the combination formula:

```python
comb(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)
```

where n! denotes the factorial of n, which is the product of all positive integers up to n. 

In this case, we have n = 2n and k = n, so:

```python
comb(2n, n) = (2n)! / (n! * n!)
```

This is the number of binary sequences of length 2n such that the sum of the first n bits is the same as the sum of the last n bits.
