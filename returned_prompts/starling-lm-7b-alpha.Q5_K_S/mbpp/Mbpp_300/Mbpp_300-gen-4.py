def count_binary_seq(n):

```

Explanation:
This function counts the number of all binary sequences of length 2n such that the sum of the first n bits is the same as the sum of the last n bits. 

The function `math.factorial(x)` calculates the factorial of x, which is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to x. 

To find the count of all binary sequences of length 2n, we need to calculate `(2 ** n)`, which is the total number of possible binary sequences of length 2n. 

To find the count of binary sequences where the sum of the first n bits is the same as the sum of the last n bits, we need to calculate `(2 ** n) // (2 ** n)`, which simplifies to just `(2 ** n)`. 

The function returns the result, which is the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that the sum of the first n bits is the same as the sum of the last n bits. 

The assertion `math.isclose(count_binary_seq(1), 2.0, rel_tol=0.001)` checks if the count of binary sequences of length 2 (which is 2) is close to the expected value of 2.0, with a relative tolerance of 0.001. 

The time complexity of this function is O(1), as it only performs a single calculation. 

The space complexity is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of memory to store the result.

Overall, this function provides an efficient and accurate solution to the problem of counting binary sequences of length 2n with a specific sum condition.
