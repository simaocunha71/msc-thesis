This problem can be solved by using a recursive approach.

Here is a step-by-step explanation:

1. If n is 0, return 1. This is the base case, as there are no bits to consider and the condition is always true.
2. For any other value of n, calculate the count by summing the count of binary sequences with n-1 bits and the same condition, but with the first and last bits added together. This is because, in a binary sequence of length 2n, the sum of the first n bits is the same as the sum of the last n bits if and only if the first and last bits are the same.
3. Return the count calculated in step 2.

Here is a Python function that implements this algorithm:

"""

def count_binary_seq(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return 2 * count_binary_seq(n - 1)

# Test the function with a small value of n
n = 1
print(count_binary_seq(n))

# Test the function with a larger value of n
n = 3
print(count_binary_seq(n))

# Test the assertion with a small value of n
assert math.isclose(count_binary_seq(1), 2.0, rel_tol=0.001)

"""
The function count_binary_seq takes an integer n as input and returns the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that the sum of the first n bits is the same as the sum of the last n bits. It uses a recursive approach to calculate the count.

In the base case, if n is 0, the function returns 1, as there are no bits to consider and the condition is always true.

For any other value of n, the function calculates the count by summing the count of binary sequences with n-1 bits and the same condition, but with the first and last bits added together. This is because, in a binary sequence of length 2n, the sum of the first n bits is the same as the sum of the last n bits if and only if the first and last bits are the same.

The function returns the count calculated in the recursive
