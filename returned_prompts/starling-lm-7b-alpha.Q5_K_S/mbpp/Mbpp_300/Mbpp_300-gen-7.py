# This problem can be solved by using a bit manipulation approach.
# Here's a detailed explanation:
# 
# First, let's consider a binary sequence of length 2n, where n is a positive integer. The sum of the first n bits can be either 0 or 1, and the sum of the last n bits can also be either 0 or 1. 
# 
# We can represent each bit as a power of 2, where the leftmost bit has a value of 2^(n-1), the second leftmost bit has a value of 2^(n-2), and so on. 
# 
# To find the count of all binary sequences with the same sum of first n bits and last n bits, we can use a bitwise XOR operation. 
# 
# The XOR operation between two bits returns 1 if the bits are different, and 0 if they are the same. 
# 
# Let's consider an example to illustrate the process. 
# 
# Suppose we have a binary sequence of length 4 (i.e., n = 2). The sum of the first two bits can be either 0 or 1, and the sum of the last two bits can also be either 0 or 1. 
# 
# We can represent each bit as a power of 2, where the leftmost bit has a value of 2^(n-1) = 2^1 = 2, the second leftmost bit has a value of 2^(n-2) = 2^0 = 1, and so on. 
# 
# The XOR operation between the first two bits (2) and the last two bits (1) is 3. 
# 
# Therefore, the count of all binary sequences with the same sum of first n bits and last n bits is equal to 2^(XOR operation result). 
# 
# In the example above, the count is 2^3 = 8. 
# 
# Here's a Python function that implements this approach:

# Function to calculate the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that the sum of first n bits is same as the sum of last n bits
