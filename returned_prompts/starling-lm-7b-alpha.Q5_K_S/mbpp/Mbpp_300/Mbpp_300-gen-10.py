# This code defines a function `count_binary_seq` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that the sum of the first n bits is the same as the sum of the last n bits. The function uses a recursive approach to calculate the count.

# The `test_count_binary_seq` function tests the `count_binary_seq` function by comparing its output with a known correct result for the case when `n` is 1. If the two results are close within a relative tolerance of 0.001, the test passes and the message "All tests passed." is printed. Otherwise, an error is raised.

# Finally, the `if __name__ == "__main__":` condition ensures that the test is only run if the script is executed directly, not if it is imported as a module.

# This solution correctly calculates the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that
