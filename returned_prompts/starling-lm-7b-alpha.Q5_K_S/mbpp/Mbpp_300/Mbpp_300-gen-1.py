To solve this problem, we can use the concept of Pascal's Triangle. Here are the steps to solve it:

1. Generate the Pascal's Triangle of size 2*n+1.
2. Traverse through the Pascal's Triangle and find the combinations where the sum of the first half is equal to the sum of the second half.
3. Add up all the combinations and return the result.

Here's the implementation of the above approach:

```python
def count_binary_seq(n):
    # Generate the Pascal's Triangle of size 2*n+1
    pascal_triangle = generate_pascal_triangle(2*n+1)
    
    # Traverse through the Pascal's Triangle and find the combinations where the sum of the first half is equal to the sum of the second half
    combinations = []
    for i in range(len(pascal_triangle)):
        for j in range(i+1):
            if pascal_triangle[i][j] % 2 == 0:
                combinations.append(pascal_triangle[i][j])
                
    # Add up all the combinations and return the result
    return sum(combinations)
```

In the above code, we first generate the Pascal's Triangle of size 2*n+1 using the `generate_pascal_triangle` function. Then, we traverse through the Pascal's Triangle and find the combinations where the sum of the first half is equal to the sum of the second half. We add up all the combinations and return the result.

To test the function, you can use the following assertion:
```python
import math
assert math.isclose(count_binary_seq(1), 2.0, rel_tol=0.001)
```
This assertion checks if the result of `count_binary_seq(1)` is approximately equal to 2 within a relative tolerance of 0.001.

You can use the above code and assertion to solve the problem and verify the correctness of the implementation.
