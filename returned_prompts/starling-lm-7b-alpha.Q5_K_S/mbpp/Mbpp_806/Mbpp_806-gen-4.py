Explanation:
To find the maximum run of uppercase characters in a string, we initialize two variables, `max_run_uppercase` and `current_run_uppercase`, to 0. We then iterate through each character in the string. If a character is uppercase, we increment `current_run_uppercase` by 1. If a character is not uppercase, we compare `current_run_uppercase` with `max_run_uppercase` and update `max_run_uppercase` if necessary. We also reset `current_run_uppercase` to 0. After the loop, we compare `current_run_uppercase` with `max_run_uppercase` one final time to ensure we have captured the maximum run of uppercase characters in the string. Finally, we return `max_run_uppercase`.

In the given example, the function `max_run_uppercase` is called with the string `'GeMKSForGERksISBESt'`. The function correctly identifies the maximum run of uppercase characters as 5, which corresponds to the sequence `'MKSFor'`.

The time complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because we iterate through each character in the string exactly once.

The space complexity of the
