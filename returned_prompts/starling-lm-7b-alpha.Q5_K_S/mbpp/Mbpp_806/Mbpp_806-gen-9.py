# Python program to find maximum run of uppercase characters in the given string

# Function to find maximum run of uppercase characters
def maxRunUppercase(s):
    r = 0
    c = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i].isupper():
            c += 1
        else:
            r = max(r, c)
            c = 0
    return max(r, c)
```

This problem can be solved by iterating through the string and keeping track of the maximum run of uppercase characters. The function `max_run_uppercase` initializes `r` and `c` to 0. It then iterates through the string, incrementing `c` by 1 for each uppercase character. If a non-uppercase character is encountered, `r` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `c`, and `c` is reset to 0. Finally, the maximum of `r` and `c` is returned as the result.

For example, when `max_run_uppercase('GeMKSForGERksISBESt')` is called, it will return 5, as the maximum run of uppercase characters in the string is 5.

The `maxRunUppercase` function in Python follows a similar logic. It initializes `r` and `c` to 0 and iterates through the string, updating `c` and `r` accordingly.

Overall, both functions solve the problem of finding the maximum run of uppercase characters in a string.

```python
def max_run_uppercase(s):
    r = 0
    c = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i].isupper():
            c += 1
        else:
            r = max(r, c)
            c = 0
