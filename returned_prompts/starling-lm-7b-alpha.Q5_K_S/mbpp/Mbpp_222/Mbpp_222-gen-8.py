"""
Here is a Python function to check if all the elements in tuple have same data type or not:

def check_type(tup):
    return all(map(lambda x: type(x) == type(tup[0]), tup))
"""

# The function uses a generator expression to apply the type check to each element in the tuple and then uses the all() function to check if all the checks passed.

# Here's an example of how you can use this function:

def check_type(tup):
    return all(map(lambda x: type(x) == type(tup[0]), tup))

# Here's an example of how you can use this function:

print(check_type((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6)))  # Output: True
print(check_type((5, "6", 7, 3, 5, "6")))  # Output: False

# The function returns True if all elements in the tuple are of the same type as the first element, and False otherwise.

# This function can be used to check if all elements in a tuple are of the same data type or not.

# It's a useful function if you want to ensure that all elements in a tuple have the same data type, for example if you want to perform a specific operation on a tuple that requires all elements to be of the same type.

# This function can be used in a variety of situations where you need to ensure that all elements in a tuple have the same data type.

# This function can be used to validate input data, for example if you want to ensure that all elements in a tuple have the same data type before performing a specific operation on them.

# This function can also be used in a variety of other situations where you need to ensure that all elements in a tuple have the same data type.

# Here are some additional examples of how you can use this function:
