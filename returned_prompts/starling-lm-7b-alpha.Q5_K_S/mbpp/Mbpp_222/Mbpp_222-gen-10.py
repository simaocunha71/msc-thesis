To solve this problem, we can define a function named check_type which takes a tuple as an argument. Inside the function, we can use the isinstance() function to check the data type of each element in the tuple. The isinstance() function returns True if the specified object is of the specified type; otherwise False.
We can initialize a variable, same_type, as True. Then, we can iterate over each element in the tuple and check if the data type of the element is not same as the data type of the first element in the tuple. If the data type of any element is not same as the data type of the first element, we can set the same_type variable as False and break the loop. If the loop completes without finding any differing data type, we can return the value of same_type variable.
Here is the step-by-step code to solve this problem:
"""
def check_type(t):
    same_type = True
    for elem in t:
        if not isinstance(elem, type(t[0])):
            same_type = False
            break
    return same_type

# Testing the function
assert check_type((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6) ) == True

# The above code will return True if all the elements in the tuple have the same data type. Otherwise, it will return False.

"""
Here is an explanation of the code:
- The check_type() function takes a tuple, t, as an argument.
- The variable, same_type, is initialized as True. This variable will keep track of whether all the elements in the tuple have the same data type or not.
- The for loop iterates over each element in the tuple.
- Inside the loop, the isinstance() function is used to check if the data type of the current element is not same as the data type of the first element in the tuple. If the data type of the current element is not same as the data type of the first element, the same_type variable is set as False and the loop is broken using the break statement.
- After the loop, the same_type variable is returned as the result of the function. If the same_type variable is True, it means all the elements in the tuple have the same data type. If the same_type variable is False
