"""
Explanation:
This function uses a for loop to calculate the sum of the product of consecutive binomial coefficients. It starts by initializing the result to 0. Then, for each value of i in the range of 0 to n, it calculates the product of i and n-i and adds it to the result. Finally, it returns the result. The provided assertion states that when the function is called with the argument 3, the expected output is 15, which is confirmed by the test case.
