"""
Explanation:
To find the combinations of sums with tuples in the given tuple list, we can use the combinations function from itertools module. The combinations function returns all possible combinations of the iterable. We can use a for loop to iterate through the list and for each tuple, we can use another for loop to generate all possible combinations of the tuple. Finally, we append these combinations to the result list and return it. The assert statement is used to check if the function is working correctly.

Explanation:
The above Python program defines a function named find_combinations that takes a list of tuples as an argument. It initializes an empty list named result to store the combinations of sums. The function uses a for loop to iterate through the tuples_list. For each tuple, it uses another for loop to generate all possible combinations of the tuple using the combinations function from itertools module. The combinations function returns an iterator of tuples, which we convert to a tuple using tuple() and append to the result list. Finally, the function returns the result list.
