To find the combinations of the tuples in the given tuple list, you can use the following approach:

1. Define a function called `find_combinations` that takes a tuple list as input.
2. Create an empty list called `result` to store the combinations.
3. Iterate through the tuple list using a nested loop. The outer loop iterates through the first tuple, while the inner loop iterates through the rest of the tuples.
4. Within the inner loop, add a tuple to the `result` list. This tuple is created by concatenating the value from the current outer tuple with the value from the current inner tuple.
5. After the inner loop completes for each outer tuple, add the `result` list to the `result` list itself. This creates a new level of nesting for the combinations.
6. Repeat steps 4-5 until all tuples have been iterated through.
7. Return the `result` list as the output of the function.
8. Test the function with the provided example, `find_combinations([(2, 4), (6, 7), (5, 1), (6, 10)])`, and assert that the output matches the expected result, `[(8, 11), (7, 5), (8, 14), (11, 8), (12, 17), (11, 11)]`.

Here's the code for the solution:

```python
def find_combinations(tuples):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(tuples)):
        temp_result = [(tuples[i][0], t[0] + tuples[i][1] for t in tuples[i+1:]]
        result.append(temp_result)
    return result
```

You can use this function to find the combinations of sums with tuples in any given tuple list.
