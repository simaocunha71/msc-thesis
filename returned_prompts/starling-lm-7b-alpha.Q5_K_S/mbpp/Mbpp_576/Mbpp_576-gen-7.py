"""
Explanation:
The function is_Sub_Array checks if the length of the first list is larger than the length of the second list. If it is, then the first list can not be a sublist of the second list, and False is returned. Otherwise, the function iterates through the first list and checks if each element is in the second list. If an element is not in the second list, then the first list can not be a sublist of the second list, and False is returned. If the function iterates through all the elements of the first list and each element is in the second list, then the first list can be a sublist of the second list, and True is returned.

The assert statement tests the function by providing a case in which the first list is not a sublist of the second list, and checks if the function correctly returns False.
