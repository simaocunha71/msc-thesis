Here is the Python program that checks whether a list is a sublist of another or not:

```python
def is_Sub_Array(list1, list2):
    return len(set(list1).intersection(set(list2))) > 0
```
This program uses the `intersection()` method from the `set` class to find the common elements between the two lists. If there is at least one common element, then `is_Sub_Array()` returns `True` indicating that `list1` is a sublist of `list2`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The `set` class in Python provides efficient methods for performing set operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference. In this program, we use the `intersection()` method to find the common elements between the two sets created from the lists `list1` and `list2`. The result is a set with the common elements.

The `len()` function is used to get the length of the intersection set. If the length is greater than 0, it means there are common elements between the two lists, and thus `list1` is a sublist of `list2`. Otherwise, if the length is 0, it means there are no common elements, and thus `list1` is not a sublist of `list2`.

Here are some tests to demonstrate the functionality of the program:

```python
assert is_Sub_Array([1,4,3,5],[1,2]) == False
assert is_Sub_Array([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2,3,4,5]) == True
assert is_Sub_Array([1,2,3,4,5],[2,3,4,5]) == True
assert is_Sub_Array([1,2,3,4,5],[1,2,3,6,5]) == False
```

These tests show that the `is_Sub_Array()` function correctly determines whether one list is a sublist of another or not.

```python
def is_Sub_Array(list1, list2):
    return len(set(list1).intersection(set(list2))) > 0
```

This is a Python function that takes two lists
