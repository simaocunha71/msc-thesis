Explanation:
In this problem, we need to find the number of sequences of length n, where each element is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to twice the previous element but less than or equal to m.

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We can create a function `get_total_number_of_sequences` that takes in two parameters, `m` and `n`. Inside the function, we have a base case for when `n` is equal to 1 or 2. If `n` is equal to 1, we simply return `m` as there is only one possible sequence. If `n` is equal to 2, we return `m // 2 + 1` as the first element can be any number from 2 to `m`, and the second element can be any number from 4 to `m`.

For the general case, when `n` is greater than 2, we can use a recursive approach. We iterate from 1 to `n` and calculate the total number of sequences for each value of `i` using the function `get_total_number_of_sequences(m, i)`. We then sum up all these values to get the total number of sequences.

Finally, we can test the function with the given example `get_total_number_of_sequences(10, 4)` and assert that it returns 4.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) as we are iterating from 1 to `n` and calculating the total number of sequences for each value of `i`. The space complexity is O(1) as we are not using any additional data structures to store intermediate results.

The provided code implements this solution and can be used to find the total number of sequences for any given values of `m` and `n`.

It's worth noting that there are alternative approaches to solve this problem,
