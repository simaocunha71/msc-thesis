    if n == 3:
        return m // 2 + m // 4 + 1

This function uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. It first computes the number of possible sequences for lengths 1, 2, and 3, then uses these values to compute the number of sequences for longer lengths.

For example, for length 4, there are 5 possible sequences (1, 2, 4, 8), (1, 2, 4, 16), (1, 2, 4, 32), (1, 2, 4, 64), (1, 2, 8, 16). The function computes this by considering each sequence of length 3, and multiplying the number of sequences of length 3 by the number of possibilities for the next element. Since the next element must be greater than or equal to twice the previous element, there are m // (2 ** (n - 1)) + 1 possibilities for the next element.

The function then uses a similar approach to compute the number of sequences for lengths greater than 4. For each length from 5 to n, the function computes the number of sequences by considering each sequence of length n - i - 1, and multiplying the number of sequences of length n - i - 1 by the number of possibilities for the next element. The number of possibilities for the next element is m // (2 ** (n - i - 1)) + 1.

Finally, the function returns the total number of sequences by summing the number of sequences for each length from 1 to n.

The function has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1).

To test the function, you can use the `assert` statement to check that the function correctly computes the number of sequences for the given inputs.
