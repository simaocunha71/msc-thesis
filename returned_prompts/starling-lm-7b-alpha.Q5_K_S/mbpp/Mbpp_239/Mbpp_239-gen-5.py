Explanation:

This function takes in two positive integers, m and n. It initializes a count variable to zero. It then starts a loop that iterates through the range of 1 to m+1. This loop represents the possible first numbers in a sequence. If the current number is greater than m, it breaks out of the loop, as the maximum possible number in a sequence is m.

Inside the loop, there is another loop that iterates n-1 times. This loop represents the rest of the sequence. It checks if the current number multiplied by 2 is greater than m. If it is, it breaks out of the loop, as the maximum possible number in a sequence is m. If the current number multiplied by 2 is less than or equal to the current number, it increments the count variable by one. This is because the next number in the sequence must be greater than or equal to twice the previous number.

Finally, the function returns the count variable, which represents the total number of possible sequences of length n that satisfy the given conditions.

The assert statement at the beginning of the function verifies that the function returns the correct result for the given example input of (10, 4).

Overall, this function finds the number of possible sequences of length n, such that each element is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to twice the previous element but less than or equal to m.

```python
# Example usage:
print(get_total_number_of_sequences(10, 4))  # Output: 4
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to use the function with the example input of (10, 4) and prints the result, which is 4.
