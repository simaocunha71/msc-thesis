# This is a recursive function, but the definition does not allow recursion.
# The definition of the Jacobsthal sequence is given by the following recurrence relation:
# J(n+1) = J(n) + J(n-1) + 2J(n-2)
# With initial conditions J(0) = 0, J(1) = 1, J(2) = 1, and J(3) = 3.
# This is a very common recurrence relation, which corresponds to the coefficients of the polynomial
# defined by the generating function of the sequence. In this case, the generating function is x + x^2 + 2x^3 + 2x^4 + ...

# The code above implements the recurrence relation directly in a loop, which is faster than using recursion.

# It is important to note that the recurrence relation is not unique for a given sequence. For example, the Fibonacci sequence can be generated using the recurrence relation F(n+1) = F(n) + F(n-1), but it can also be generated using the recurrence relation F(n+2) = F(n) + F(n+1).
