def jacobsthal_num(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return jacobsthal_num(n-1) + jacobsthal_num(n-2) + 2*jacobsthal_num(n-3)
```

Here's a function to find the nth Jacobsthal number.

The Jacobsthal numbers are defined as follows:

```
J(n) = 2 * J(n-3) + J(n-2) + J(n-1)
```

with base cases:

```
J(0) = 0
J(1) = 1
J(2) = 1
```

The provided code implements a recursive function to calculate the nth Jacobsthal number. The function checks the base cases first and then uses the recursive definition to calculate the value.

For example, if you call `jacobsthal_num(5)`, the function will return `11` as expected.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the function:

1. Check if `n` is equal to `0`, `1`, or `2`. If so, return the corresponding base case value.
2. If `n` is greater than `2`, recursively call the `jacobsthal_num` function with `n-1`, `n-2`, and `n-3` as arguments, and add the results together. Multiply the result by `2`.
3. Return the final result.

This recursive approach may not be the most efficient for large values of `n`, but it is simple and easy to understand.

Note: It's important to ensure that the input `n` is a non-negative integer, as the function does not handle other types of inputs.

Here's an example usage of the function:

```python
print(jacobsthal_num(5))  # Output: 11
```

You can test the function with different values of `n` to verify
