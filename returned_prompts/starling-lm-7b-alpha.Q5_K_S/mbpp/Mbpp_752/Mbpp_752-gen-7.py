"""
The Jacobsthal sequence is a sequence of integers that are generated by a recursive formula, which is a variation of the Lucas sequence.

The first few terms are:

0, 1, 1, 3, 5, 11, 21, 43, 85, 171, 341, 683, 1365, ...

The nth term of the Jacobsthal sequence can be calculated using the following recursive formula:

J(n) = J(n−1) + J(n−2) + 2 * J(n−3)

For the base cases, J(0) = 0, J(1) = 1, and J(2) = 1. 

Here's a Python function that calculates the nth term of the Jacobsthal sequence:

def jacobsthal_num(n):
    if n < 0:
        return None
    elif n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        a = [0, 1, 1]
        for i in range(3, n + 1):
            a.append(a[i - 1] + a[i - 2] + 2 * a[i - 3])
        return a[n]

You can test the function with jacobsthal_num(5) to get the fifth term of the Jacobsthal sequence, which is 11.
