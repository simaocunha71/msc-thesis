def jacobsthal_num(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n == 2:
        return 1

```

This function uses a recursive approach to calculate the nth Jacobsthal number. The first few Jacobsthal numbers are given as the base cases, and for any number greater than 2, the nth Jacobsthal number is calculated by adding the (n-1)th, (n-2)th, and (n-3)th Jacobsthal numbers together and taking the modulo 1,000,000,007 to ensure that the result does not overflow. 

The time complexity of this function is O(2^n) due to the recursive calls, and the space complexity is also O(2^n) due to the stack space required for the recursive calls. 

To improve the efficiency, a dynamic programming approach can be used to avoid redundant calculations, which can reduce the time complexity to O(n). 

Here's an example of how to use the function:

```python
print(jacobsthal_num(5))  # Output: 11
```

This will print the 5th Jacobsthal number, which is 11.

The assert statement at the beginning of the function is a way to check whether the function is working correctly. It checks if the function returns the correct result for the 5th Jacobsthal number, which is 11. If the assertion fails, it means that the function is not correctly implemented. 

In this case, the assertion is true, so the function is correct.

The modulo operation at the end of the function is necessary because the Jacobsthal numbers can become very large very quickly. By taking the modulo 1,000,000,007, we ensure that the result is within a reasonable range.
