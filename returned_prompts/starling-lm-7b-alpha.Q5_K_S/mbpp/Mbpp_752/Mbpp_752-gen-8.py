def jacobsthal_num(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        a = [0, 1, 1, 3, 5, 11, 21, 43, 85, 171, 341, 683, 1365, 2731]
        return a[n-1]+2*a[n-2]+a[n-3]
```

The code defines a function `jacobsthal_num` that calculates the nth Jacobsthal number using a predefined list `a` of the first 14 Jacobsthal numbers. The function first checks if `n` is 0 or 1 and returns the corresponding value from `a`. For any other value of `n`, it uses the formula `a[n-1]+2*a[n-2]+a[n-3]` to calculate the nth Jacobsthal number. The function then returns the calculated value.

To test the function, you can use the `assert` statement to check if the function returns the expected value for the 5th Jacobsthal number, which is 11. If the assertion passes, it means that the function is correctly calculating the Jacobsthal numbers.

To use the function, you can call it with the desired value of `n` as an argument. For example, to find the 10th Jacobsthal number, you can call `jacobsthal_num(10)`. The function will return the value of the 10th Jacobsthal number, which is 85.

In summary, the provided code defines a function to calculate the nth Jacobsthal number using a predefined list of the first 14 Jacobsthal numbers and a formula. It also includes a test to verify the correctness of the function.
