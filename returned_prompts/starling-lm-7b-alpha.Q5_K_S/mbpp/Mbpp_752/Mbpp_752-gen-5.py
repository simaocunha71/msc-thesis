This code defines a function `jacobsthal_num` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the `n`th Jacobsthal number. The Jacobsthal numbers are a sequence of numbers that can be defined recursively using the formula `J(n) = 2 * J(n-1) + 2 * J(n-2) - 1`. The base cases are `J(0) = 0` and `J(1) = J(2) = 1`. The function uses recursion to calculate the `n`th Jacobsthal number by repeatedly applying the formula until it reaches one of the base cases.

To use this function, you can call it with an integer argument representing the position of the Jacobsthal number you want to find. For example, `jacobsthal_num(5)` will return `11`, which is the 5th Jacobsthal number.

You can test the function by running the provided assertion, which checks if `jacobsthal_num(5)` is equal to `11`. If the assertion passes, it means that the function correctly calculates the 5th Jacobsthal number.

Note that the Jacobsthal numbers can grow very quickly, so be cautious when using this function with large input values.

Here are some additional examples of how you can use this function:

```python
print(jacobsthal_num(0))  # Output: 0
print(jacobsthal_num(1))  # Output: 1
print(jacobsthal_num(2))  # Output: 1
print(jacobsthal_num
