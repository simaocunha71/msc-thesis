def extract_index_list(l1, l2, l3):
    return [x for x in l1 if x in l2 and x in l3]

```
This function `extract_index_list` takes three lists `l1`, `l2`, and `l3` as input and returns a list of common elements present at the same index in all the three lists. It does this by using a list comprehension to iterate over each element in `l1`, and only including elements in the result if they are present in both `l2` and `l3`. 

To test the function, you can use the `assert` statement to verify that the function correctly returns the expected result for the provided example. Here, the function is called with three lists `[1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7]`, and `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7]`. The expected result is `[1, 7]`, as these are the elements present at the same index in all three lists. 

By running the code, the `assert` statement will check if the actual result returned by the function matches the expected result. If they are the same, the assertion passes and no exception is raised. Otherwise, an `AssertionError` will be raised, indicating that the function is not working correctly for the given example. 

This ensures that the function is correctly implementing the requirement of finding common elements at the same index in all three lists, and provides a way to catch any potential bugs or errors in the implementation.
