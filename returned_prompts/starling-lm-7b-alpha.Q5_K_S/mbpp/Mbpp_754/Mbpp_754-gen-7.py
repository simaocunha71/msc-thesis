"""
The function works by iterating over the indices in the first list. For each index, it checks if the value at that index in each of the three lists is the same. If it is, the value is appended to the result list. Finally, the function returns the result list.
"""



# Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the three lists. This is because the function iterates over the indices of one of the lists.

# Space Complexity: O(1), because the function only uses a constant amount of extra space to store the result list.


# Note: This solution assumes that the input lists are non-empty and contain only elements that can be compared for equality. If this is not the case, additional error handling may be needed.
