Explanation:
The function `is_monotonic` checks whether the given array `A` is monotonic or not. It iterates through the array and compares each element with the next element. If any element is greater than the next element, it returns `False`, indicating that the array is not monotonic. Otherwise, it returns `True`, indicating that the array is monotonic.

For the given example, `is_monotonic([6, 5, 4, 4])` returns `True` because all elements in the array are in descending order, which is the definition of a monotonic array.

Note that the function assumes that the array is non-empty and contains at least two elements. If the array can be empty or have only one element, you can add appropriate checks at the beginning of the function.

Also, this solution assumes that monotonicity is defined as either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing order. If you want to consider arrays that are non-decreasing (i.e., either strictly increasing or constant), you can modify the function to compare each element with the next element in a different way.

Lastly, this solution uses a simple approach to check monotonicity by comparing adjacent elements. However, there are more efficient algorithms available that can check monotonicity in linear time complexity.

Here's an example of how you can use the function:

```python
print(is_monotonic([6, 5, 4, 4]))  # Output: True
print(is_monotonic([5, 4, 3, 3]))  # Output: True
print(is_monotonic([5, 4, 3, 2]))  # Output: False
```

The first example returns `True` because all elements in the array are in descending order. The second example also returns `True` because the array is non-decreasing. The third example returns `False` because the array is not monotonic.

By using this function, you can easily check whether a given
