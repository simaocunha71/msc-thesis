Here are the steps to find kth element from the given two sorted arrays:

1. Initialize two pointers at the start of the arrays.
2. While both pointers are within the array bounds, compare the values at the pointers.
   If the value at the first array pointer is less than or equal to the value at the second array pointer, increment the first pointer.
   Otherwise, increment the second pointer.
3. If the first pointer reaches the end of the first array, the kth element is the value at the second array pointer.
4. If the second pointer reaches the end of the second array, the kth element is the value at the first array pointer.
5. If both pointers reach the end of their respective arrays, the kth element is the maximum value of the arrays.

Here is a Python function that implements these steps:
