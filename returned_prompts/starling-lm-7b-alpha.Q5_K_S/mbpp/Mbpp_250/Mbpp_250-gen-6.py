The assert statement verifies that the function count_X() correctly counts the occurrences of the element 4 in the tuple (10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2). By using the count() method, we can find the number of occurrences of the element 4 in the tuple and return it. If the element 4 is not present in the tuple, the function will return 0.

# In Python, the assert keyword is used to test if a condition is true or false. If the condition is true, the program continues to execute the next line of code. If the condition is false, an AssertionError is raised, indicating that the program has encountered an error. This feature helps developers detect errors during the debugging process.

# The count() method in Python is used to count the number of occurrences of a specific element in a tuple. It returns the number of times the element appears in the tuple, which is useful for analyzing the distribution of elements within the tuple.

# The count_X() function takes in a tuple and an element as parameters. It uses the count() method to count the occurrences of the element in the tuple and returns the result. If the element is not present in the tuple, the function will return 0.

# The assert statement is used to check if the function count_X() correctly counts the occurrences of the element 4 in the tuple (10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2). It compares the result of count_X() with the expected value of 0. If the two values are equal, the assert statement will not raise an AssertionError and the program will continue to execute the next line of code. Otherwise, if the values are not equal, an AssertionError will be raised, indicating that the
