    return total


# Test Case
print(cummulative_sum([(1, 3), (5, 6, 7), (2, 6)]))  # Output: 30

# Explanation:
# The function cummulative_sum() takes a tuple list as an argument. Inside the function, a variable called "total" is initialized with a value of 0. Then, a for loop is used to iterate over each tuple in the given tuple_list. For each tuple, the sum() function is used to calculate the sum of all the values in the tuple, and this sum is added to the "total" variable. Finally, the "total" variable, which now holds the cumulative sum of all the values in the tuple_list, is returned by the function. In the provided test case, the cumulative sum of the values in the tuple_list [(1, 3), (5, 6, 7), (2, 6)] is calculated and the result, 30, is printed to the console.
