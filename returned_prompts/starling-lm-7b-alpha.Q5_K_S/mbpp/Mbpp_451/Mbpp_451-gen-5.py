```
def remove_whitespaces(s: str) -> str:
    return s.replace(" ", "")
```

Explanation:

The `replace` method is a built-in method in Python that replaces occurrences of a substring with another substring. In this case, we are replacing all spaces (substrings) with an empty string (replacement).

The `remove_whitespaces` function takes a string `s` as an argument, and uses the `replace` method to remove all whitespaces from the string. The function then returns the modified string.

To test the function, we use the `assert` keyword to check if the function correctly removes whitespaces from the given string " Google    Flutter ". The expected output is "GoogleFlutter", which is the string with all whitespaces removed.

Overall, this solution effectively removes all whitespaces from a given string using the `replace` method in Python.

```python
def remove_whitespaces(s: str) -> str:
    return s.replace(" ", "")

assert remove_whitespaces(' Google    Flutter ') == 'GoogleFlutter'
```

In this code, the `remove_whitespaces` function is defined to take a string `s` as an argument. The function uses the `replace` method to remove all whitespaces from the string by replacing each space with an empty string. The modified string is then returned by the function.

The `assert` statement is used to check if the function correctly removes whitespaces from the given string " Google    Flutter ". The expected output is "GoogleFlutter", which is the string with all whitespaces removed.

This solution effectively removes all whitespaces from a given string using the `replace` method in Python.

```python

    return s.replace(" ", "")
```

Here is a detailed explanation of the code:

- The `remove_whitespaces` function is defined to take a string `s` as an argument.
- Inside the function, the `replace` method is used to remove all whitespaces from the string. The `replace` method replaces all occurrences of a substring (in this case, a space) with another sub
