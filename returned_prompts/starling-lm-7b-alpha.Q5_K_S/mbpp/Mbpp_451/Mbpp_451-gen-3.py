def remove_whitespaces(s):
    return s.replace(' ', '')

# Assertion Test
assert remove_whitespaces(' Google    Flutter ') == 'GoogleFlutter'





















"""
In this code, we define a function called "remove_whitespaces" that takes a string as an input. The function uses the built-in "replace" method of strings in Python to remove all occurrences of a whitespace character from the string. The "replace" method replaces all instances of the specified character (in this case, a whitespace) with an empty string, effectively removing the whitespaces from the original string.

To test the function, we use the "assert" keyword to check if the function's output matches the expected result. In this case, we expect the function to remove all whitespaces from the string " Google    Flutter " and return the string "GoogleFlutter". The assertion passes if the actual output of the function matches the expected result, and fails otherwise.
