```
def remove_whitespaces(input_str):
    return input_str.replace(" ", "")
```

Explanation:
To remove all whitespaces from a string, you can use the built-in `replace()` function in Python, which replaces a specified portion of a string with another string. In this case, we specify a single whitespace character as the portion to be replaced, and an empty string as the replacement. By replacing all whitespaces with an empty string, we effectively remove them from the original string.

In the provided code, the `remove_whitespaces()` function takes an input string `input_str` as a parameter. It then uses the `replace()` function to remove all whitespaces from the input string and returns the modified string as the result.

To verify the correctness of the function, an assertion is made using the `assert` keyword. The `assert` keyword is used to check if a condition is true. In this case, the condition is that the output of the `remove_whitespaces()` function with the input `' Google    Flutter '` should be equal to the expected output `'GoogleFlutter'`. If the condition is true, the program continues execution; otherwise, an error is raised.

By running the provided code, the assertion will pass and the program will successfully remove all whitespaces from the given string, as expected.

Note: It's important to ensure that the input string is of type `str` for this solution to work correctly.

Additionally, please note that the `replace()` function is case-sensitive, so it will only remove whitespaces and not other characters. If you want to remove all non-alphanumeric characters from the string, including whitespaces, you can modify the function as follows:

```python
def remove_non_alphanumeric(input_str):
    return ''.join(c for c in input_str if c.isalnum())
```

In this modified function, the `isalnum()` method is used to check if a character is alphanumeric (i.e., a letter or a digit). The `join()` method is then used to concatenate all the alphanumeric characters in the input string, effectively removing all non-alphanumeric characters, including whitespaces.
