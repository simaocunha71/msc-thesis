```
def remove_whitespaces(string):
    string = string.replace(' ', '')
    return string
```

Explanation:

The function `remove_whitespaces` takes a string as an argument and uses the `replace` method to replace all occurrences of a whitespace character with an empty string. The result is the original string without any whitespaces.

The `replace` method takes two arguments: the character or substring to be replaced, and the character or substring to replace it with. In this case, we are replacing every whitespace character with an empty string, effectively removing all whitespaces from the original string.

The modified string is then returned as the result of the function.

The provided `assert` statement tests the function by passing the string `' Google    Flutter '` to the `remove_whitespaces` function and verifying that the output is `'GoogleFlutter'`.

This solution demonstrates how to remove all whitespaces from a given string using the `replace` method in Python.

You can find more about the `replace` method in the Python documentation: [Python Replace Method](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#string.replace)
