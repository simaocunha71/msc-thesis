"""
In this code, we have a function called remove_whitespaces that takes a string as an argument. Inside the function, we use the replace method to replace all whitespaces in the string with an empty string. Finally, we return the modified string without any whitespaces.

To test the function, we use the print statement to display the result of the function when called with the input ' Google    Flutter '. The expected output is 'GoogleFlutter' as all whitespaces have been removed from the original string.
