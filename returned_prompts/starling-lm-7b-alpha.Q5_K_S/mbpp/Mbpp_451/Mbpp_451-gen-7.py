```python
def remove_whitespaces(string):
    return "".join(string.split())
```

Explanation:
In this code, the function `remove_whitespaces` takes a string as input. It uses the `split()` method to split the string at each whitespace character, creating a list of substrings. Then, the `join()` method is used to concatenate all the substrings together without any whitespaces, effectively removing them from the original string. The resulting string is returned as the output of the function.

The `assert` statement is used to check if the function is working correctly. In this case, it checks if the output of the function `remove_whitespaces` when called with the input string `' Google    Flutter '` is equal to the expected output `'GoogleFlutter'`. If the assertion is true, the program continues to execute normally; otherwise, an error is raised, indicating that there is a bug in the code.

To use this function, simply call it with the desired string as the argument. The function will return the modified string with all whitespaces removed.

Example usage:
```python
print(remove_whitespaces(" Google    Flutter "))  # Output: "GoogleFlutter"
```

This code can be useful in situations where you need to remove whitespaces from a string, such as in data cleaning or text processing tasks.

Note: The `split()` method in Python uses whitespace characters (including tabs, newlines, and spaces) by default. If you want to remove specific whitespaces, you can pass a regular expression pattern to the `split()` method, for example: `string.split('\s+')`.
