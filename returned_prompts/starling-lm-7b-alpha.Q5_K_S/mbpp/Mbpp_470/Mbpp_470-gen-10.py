# Solution:
# Here is a detailed step-by-step explanation of the solution:

# Step 1: Define the function add_pairwise that takes a tuple as input.

# Step 2: Initialize an empty list called result to store the pairwise sums.

# Step 3: Use a for loop to iterate through the tuple, excluding the last element. For each iteration, calculate the pairwise sum of the current element and the next element, and append it to the result list.

# Step 4: After the loop ends, append the pairwise sum of the last element and the first element to the result list.

# Step 5: Convert the result list to a tuple and return it as the output of the function.

# The solution code provided above follows these steps to implement the add_pairwise function. The function takes a tuple as input, iterates through the tuple to calculate the pairwise sums, converts the result list to a tuple, and returns it as the output. The test case at the end of the code demonstrates the usage of the function and verifies the expected output.

# The add_pairwise function can be used to find the pairwise addition of the neighboring elements of any tuple, not just the specific tuple used in the test case.
