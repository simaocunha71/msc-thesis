"""
In the above solution, we are using tuple comprehension to perform element wise modulo operation on the tuples. Here is the step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. The function tuple_modulo takes two tuples t1 and t2 as arguments.
2. We use the built-in zip() function to iterate over both tuples simultaneously. The zip() function takes multiple iterables as arguments and returns an iterator of tuples, where the i-th tuple contains the i-th element from each of the argument sequences.
3. Inside the tuple comprehension, we use the modulo operator % to perform element wise modulo operation on the corresponding elements of the tuples.
4. The tuple comprehension returns a new tuple containing the result of the modulo operation for each pair of elements.
5. The function returns the resulting tuple.
