Given an array of integers, find the maximum sum of a subarray with length k.

For example, given the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and k = 3, the maximum sum would be 9 (i.e. 5 + 4 + 3).

Note:

To solve this problem, you might think of using the sliding window technique. For every window of length k, you could find the maximum subarray sum. However, you don't need to slide the window at all. Instead, you only need to find the subarrays with the same starting index and find the maximum subarray sum of these subarrays.

Here are some tips to solve the problem:

1. To find the maximum subarray sum of all subarrays with the same starting index, you can use Kadane's algorithm. The time complexity of Kadane's algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the array.

2. To find the maximum subarray sum of all subarrays with the same length k, you can use Kad
