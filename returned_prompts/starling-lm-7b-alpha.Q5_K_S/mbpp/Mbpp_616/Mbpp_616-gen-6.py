from itertools import zip_longest

def tuple_modulo(t1, t2):
    return tuple(reduce(lambda acc, pair: acc + [(pair[0] % pair[1])], zip_longest(t1, t2)))


# Alternatively, if you are using Python 3.8 or newer, you can use the following, more concise solution:

def tuple_modulo(t1, t2):
    return tuple(x % y for x, y in zip_longest(t1, t2))

assert tuple_modulo((10, 4, 5, 6), (5, 6, 7, 5)) == (0, 4, 5, 1)


# However, it is important to note that this function is not very efficient if the tuples are large, as the zip_longest function iterates over all elements in both tuples, regardless of whether or not they are the same length. In such cases, it is recommended to use the first solution.
