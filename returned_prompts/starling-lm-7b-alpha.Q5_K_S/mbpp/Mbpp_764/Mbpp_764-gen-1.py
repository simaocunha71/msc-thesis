def number_ctr(s):
    return sum(c.isdigit() for c in s)
```

Explanation:

To count number of digits in a given string, we can use the built-in method `isdigit()` on each character in the string and then sum the True values.

The `isdigit()` method returns True if all the characters in the string are digits, otherwise False.

To count the number of digits in the string, we can use the `sum()` function along with a generator expression. The generator expression `(c.isdigit() for c in s)` will return a sequence of True and False values. The `sum()` function will add up all the True values, effectively counting the number of digits in the string.

The provided test case `assert number_ctr('program2bedone') == 1` checks if the function correctly counts the number of digits in the string 'program2bedone'. In this case, there is only one digit (the 2), so the expected output is 1.

Overall, the `number_ctr()` function provides an efficient and concise way to count the number of digits in a given string.

Here is the Python code for the `number_ctr()` function:

```python
def number_ctr(s):
    return sum(c.isdigit() for c in s)
```

You can use this function to count the number of digits in any string by passing the string as an argument to the function. For example, if you want to count the number of digits in the string "abc123def", you can call the function like this: `number_ctr("abc123def")`. The function will return the count of digits, which in this case would be 3.
```

As an additional note, if you are only interested in counting the digits and not other characters, you can modify the function to directly return the count of True values without using `sum()`:

```python
def number_ctr(s):
    return sum(c.isdigit() for c in s)
```

This modified function will still count the number of digits in the string, but it will
