def next_power_of_2(n):

    while n > 0:
        p += 1
        n >>= 1
    return 1 << p
```

The function `next_power_of_2` takes an input `n` and uses a while loop to find the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to `n`. It initializes a variable `p` to 0 and enters the while loop. In each iteration of the loop, it increments `p` by 1 and shifts `n` one place to the right (which is equivalent to performing a bitwise right shift by 1). This process continues until `n` becomes 0. Finally, it returns the result of left shifting 1 by `p` (i.e., `1 << p`), which is the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to the original value of `n`.

To verify the correctness of the function, an assertion is used to check if the function correctly returns 1 when `n` is 0. If the assertion fails, an error will be raised indicating that the function is not working as expected.

This solution uses a bitwise approach to efficiently find the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to `n`.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```python
print(next_power_of_2(0))  # Output: 1
print(next_power_of_2(10))  # Output: 16
print(next_power_of_2(12))  # Output: 16
print(next_power_of_2(24))  # Output: 32
```

By calling the `next_power_of_2` function with different inputs, you can verify that it correctly returns the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to the input value.
