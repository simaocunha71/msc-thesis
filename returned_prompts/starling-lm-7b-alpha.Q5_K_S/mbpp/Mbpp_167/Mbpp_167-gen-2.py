Here's a Python function that finds the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to n:

```python
def next_power_of_2(n):
    while n & (n - 1) != 0:
        n = n | (n - 1)
    return n
```

The function works by repeatedly applying the bitwise OR operation (`|`) to the number and its decremented value until the result is no longer divisible by 2 (i.e., the last bit is no longer 1). At that point, the result is a power of 2 that is at least as large as the original input.

In the assert statement, `next_power_of_2(0) == 1` is expected to be True, since 0 is the smallest power of 2.

For example, if you call `next_power_of_2(3)`, it will return 4, because 4 is the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to 3.

```python
print(next_power_of_2(3))  # Output: 4
```

This function is a common idiom for finding the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to a given number, and is typically used in algorithms that require a power-of-2-sized block of memory.

```python
def next_power_of_2(n):
    while n & (n - 1) != 0:
        n = n | (n - 1)
    return n
```

In the provided assertion, `next_power_of_2(0) == 1` is expected to be True, as 0 is the smallest power of 2. For example, if you call `next_power_of_2(3)`, it will return 4, as 4 is the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to 3.

This function is a common idiom for finding the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to a given number, and is often used in algorithms that require a power-of-2-sized block of memory.
