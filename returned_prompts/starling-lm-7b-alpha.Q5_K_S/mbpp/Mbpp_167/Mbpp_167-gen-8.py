Here is a simple Python function to find the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to a given number:

```python
def next_power_of_2(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    while n & (n - 1) != 0:
        n = n & (n - 1)
    return n + (n & (~n))
```

In this function, the input `n` is a positive number. The function first checks if `n` is zero, in which case it returns `1`. Otherwise, it enters a `while` loop that continues until `n` is a power of 2. In each iteration of the loop, the function clears the least significant bit of `n` by performing the bitwise AND operation between `n` and `n - 1`. This is equivalent to rounding down `n` to the nearest power of 2. Once the loop ends, the function returns the result of adding `n` to the result of performing the bitwise AND operation between `n` and the complement of `n`. This step effectively adds the highest bit of `n` to `n`, making it a power of 2.

To verify the correctness of this function, you can use the `assert` keyword to check that it correctly computes the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to 0:

```python
assert next_power_of_2(0) == 1
```

This assertion will raise an error if the function does not correctly compute the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to 0, allowing you to catch any bugs in your code.

Overall, this function provides a simple and efficient way to find the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to a given number in Python.

```python
def next_power_of_2(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    while n & (n - 1) != 0:
        n = n & (n - 1)
    return n + (n & (~n))
```

```python
assert next_power_of_2(0) == 1
```
