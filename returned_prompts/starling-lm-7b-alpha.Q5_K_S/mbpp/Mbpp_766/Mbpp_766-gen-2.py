Here's a Python solution to your problem:

```python
def pair_wise(lst):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(lst)-1):
        result.append((lst[i], lst[i+1]))
    return result
```

This function iterates through the list and appends each pair of consecutive items to a result list.
The range function is used to limit the iteration to the length of the list minus 1, because you can't access the index of the last element in the list using the index of the previous element.

It's important to note that if the input list contains less than 2 items, the function will raise an IndexError. This should be handled with a proper error checking mechanism if your use case includes such scenarios.

Here's an example of how to use this function:

```python
print(pair_wise([1,1,2,3,3,4,4,5]))  # Output: [(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5)]
```

This will print the list of all pairs of consecutive items in the input list.
