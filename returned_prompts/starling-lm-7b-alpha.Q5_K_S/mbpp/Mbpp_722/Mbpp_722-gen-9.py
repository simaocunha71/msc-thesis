"""
Here is a solution to the problem. The function takes a dictionary 'data' that contains a student's name as a key and a tuple of the student's height and weight as a value. It also takes two additional parameters: 'min_height' and 'min_weight', which are the minimum height and weight requirements, respectively.

The function initializes an empty dictionary 'filtered_data' to store the filtered results. It then iterates through each key-value pair in the 'data' dictionary using the 'items()' method. For each pair, it checks if the student's height (accessed via indexing the tuple) is greater than the 'min_height' parameter and if the student's weight (accessed via indexing the tuple) is greater than the 'min_weight' parameter. If both conditions are true, the student's name and tuple of height and weight are added to the 'filtered_data' dictionary.

Finally, the function returns the 'filtered_data' dictionary, which contains only the student(s) who meet the minimum height and weight requirements.

When the function is tested with the provided input, it correctly filters the students and returns the expected output: {'Cierra Vega': (6.2, 70)}.

"""
This function works by iterating over the items in the dictionary and checking if the height and weight are above the minimum values. If they are, the student's name and height/weight tuple are added to a new dictionary.
