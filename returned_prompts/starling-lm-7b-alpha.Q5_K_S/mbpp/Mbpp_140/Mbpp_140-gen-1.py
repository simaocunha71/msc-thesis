```
def extract_singly(list_of_lists):
    return set([item for sublist in list_of_lists for item in sublist])
```
    
# Expected Output:
set([3, 4, 5, 7, 1])




This code defines a function called `extract_singly` which takes in a parameter `list_of_lists`. It then uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in `list_of_lists` and each item in the sublist, appending them to a new list. Finally, the function returns a set of the items in the new list. 

The provided assertion checks if the set of the items in the list returned by `extract_singly` is equal to the expected set `[3, 4, 5, 7, 1]`. 

The expected output is a set containing the numbers `[3, 4, 5, 7, 1]`.




This code can be used to flatten a list of lists into a single set of numbers. It takes a list of lists as input and returns a set of the individual numbers from each sublist. The set is used to ensure that duplicate numbers are not included in the result. 

To use this code, you can call the `extract_singly` function and pass in your list of lists as an argument. The function will return a set of the flattened list of lists. 

For example, if you have a list of lists `[(3, 4, 5), (4, 5, 7), (1, 4)]`, you can call the function like this: `extract_singly([(3, 4, 5), (4, 5, 7), (1, 4)])`. The function will then return a set `[3, 4, 5, 7, 1]`. 

This can be useful in situations where you have nested lists of numbers and you want to extract all the numbers into a single set, without any duplicates.

Here is a detailed explanation of the solution:

The solution begins by defining a function called `extract_singly` that takes a single parameter, `list_of_lists
