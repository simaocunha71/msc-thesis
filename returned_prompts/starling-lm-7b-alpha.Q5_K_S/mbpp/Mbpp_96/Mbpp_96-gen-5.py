# This code is incorrect. Here is the correct implementation:

def divisor(num):
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, num + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            count += 1
    return count

print(divisor(15))  # This will return 4, as expected.

# Here's an explanation of the code:

# The function `divisor` takes an integer `num` as input.
# It initializes a variable `count` to 0 to keep track of the number of divisors.
# It then loops through all numbers from 1 to `num` (inclusive) using a `for` loop.
# Inside the loop, it checks if `num` is divisible by the current number `i` using the modulus operator (`%`).
# If `num` is divisible by `i`, it increments the `count` variable by 1.
# After the loop finishes, the function returns the final value of `count`, which represents the number of divisors of the original input.

# The `print(divisor(15))` statement at the end of the code calls the `divisor` function with the input `15` and prints the result, which should be `4` in this case.

# This implementation correctly counts the number of divisors of a given integer, and the assertion `assert divisor(15) == 4` is satisfied.
