"""
In this problem, you are asked to write a function that calculates the perimeter of a square. The perimeter of a square is equal to four times its side length. The function should take the side length of the square as an input and return the perimeter.

The function is defined as follows:

def square_perimeter(side):
    return 4 * side

To test the function, the code includes an assertion that checks if the result of the function for a given side length (in this case, 10) is equal to the expected perimeter (40). If the assertion is True, it means that the function is working correctly.

The print statement is used to display the result of the assertion. If the assertion is True, it will print nothing. Otherwise, it will raise an AssertionError with an error message.

By running this code, you can verify that the function correctly calculates the perimeter of a square given its side length as input.
"""

```python
def square_perimeter(side):
    return 4 * side
```

To use the function, you can simply call it with the desired side length as an argument. For example, `square_perimeter(10)` will return 40, which is the perimeter of a square with a side length of 10.

```python
print(square_perimeter(10))  # Output: 40
```

You can test the function with different side lengths to confirm that it works correctly. For example, `square_perimeter(5)` will return 20, and `square_perimeter(8)` will return 32.

```python
print(square_perimeter(5))  # Output: 20
print(square_perimeter(8))  # Output: 32
```

The function is simple and straightforward, but it effectively solves the problem of calculating the perimeter of a square given its side length.
```python
