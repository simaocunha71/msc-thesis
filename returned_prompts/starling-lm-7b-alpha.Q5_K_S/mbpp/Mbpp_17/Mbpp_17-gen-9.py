```
def square_perimeter(side_length):
    return 4 * side_length
```

Explanation:
To find the perimeter of a square, you need to multiply the length of one side by 4. In the function `square_perimeter`, the parameter `side_length` is multiplied by 4 and returned as the result. When you pass a side length of 10 to the function, it will return 40, as expected by the assert statement.

Here's an example of how you can use the function:

```python
print(square_perimeter(10))  # Output: 40
```

By calling the `square_perimeter` function with the side length of 10, you will get the perimeter of the square, which is 40.

This function follows the problem statement and provides a solution to calculate the perimeter of a square given its side length.

Note that the function name `square_perimeter` is descriptive and clearly indicates its purpose, making it easy to understand its functionality.

Make sure to test the function with different side lengths to verify its accuracy and correctness.

```python
print(square_perimeter(5))  # Output: 20
print(square_perimeter(8))  # Output: 32
```

These examples demonstrate how the function can be used to find the perimeter of squares with different side lengths.

Overall, this solution is concise, efficient, and accurately solves the problem of calculating the perimeter of a square based on its side length.

```python
def square_perimeter(side_length):
    return 4 * side_length
```

This Python function `square_perimeter` takes a single parameter `side_length` and returns the perimeter of a square. It does this by multiplying the `side_length` by 4, as the perimeter of a square is equal to four times its side length.

To use this function, you can simply call it with the desired `side_length` as an argument. For example, if you want to find the perimeter of a square with a side length of 10, you can call the function like this:
