```
def square_perimeter(length):
    return 4 * length
```

Explanation:

To solve this problem, we can define a function called `square_perimeter` that takes the `length` of a side of the square as its input. The function should return the perimeter of the square, which can be calculated by multiplying the length of one side by 4 (since a square has four equal sides).

In the provided solution, the `square_perimeter` function multiplies the length of the side by 4 and returns the result. This means that if we pass a value of 10 to the function, it will return 40, which is the correct perimeter of a square with a side length of 10 units.

To verify the correctness of the solution, an assertion is included at the end of the code. The assertion checks if the result of calling the `square_perimeter` function with an input of 10 is equal to 40. If the assertion is true, it means that the solution correctly calculates the perimeter of a square with a given side length.

Overall, this solution provides a straightforward and accurate way to calculate the perimeter of a square based on its side length.

```python
def square_perimeter(length):
    return 4 * length
```

To use this solution, you can simply call the `square_perimeter` function with the desired side length as the argument. The function will return the perimeter of the square.

Here are some example usages of the `square_perimeter` function:

```python
print(square_perimeter(5))  # Output: 20
print(square_perimeter(10))  # Output: 40
print(square_perimeter(8))  # Output: 32
```

By providing different side lengths as arguments to the `square_perimeter` function, you can calculate the perimeter of squares with different side lengths accurately.

```python
def square_perimeter(length):
    return 4 * length
```

The `square_perimeter` function is a Python function that calculates and returns the perimeter of a square based on the length of one of its sides. It
