```
def square_perimeter(side):
    return 4 * side
```

Explanation:

The perimeter of a square is given by the formula P = 4 * side, where P is the perimeter and side is the length of one side of the square. The function `square_perimeter` takes the side length as input and returns the perimeter of the square by applying the formula. In the given example, if the side length is 10, the function will return 4 * 10 = 40, which is the perimeter of the square.

To test the function, an `assert` statement is used to check if the function returns the expected result. In this case, the `assert` statement checks if `square_perimeter(10)` is equal to 40. If the condition is true, the program will continue execution; otherwise, an error will be raised. This ensures that the function is working correctly and produces the expected result.

Overall, the function `square_perimeter` provides a way to calculate the perimeter of a square given its side length as input, and the `assert` statement is used to verify the correctness of the function's implementation.

```python
def square_perimeter(side):
    return 4 * side
```

This Python function calculates the perimeter of a square given its side length. The function takes the side length as input and multiplies it by 4 to obtain the perimeter. The result is then returned by the function. For example, if the side length is 10, the function will return 40, which is the perimeter of the square.

To test the function, an `assert` statement is used to check if the function returns the expected result. In this case, the `assert` statement checks if `square_perimeter(10)` is equal to 40. If the condition is true, the program will continue execution; otherwise, an error will be raised. This ensures that the function is working correctly and produces the expected result.

In summary, the function `square_perimeter` provides a straightforward way to calculate the perimeter of a square given its side length, and the `assert` statement is used to verify the correctness of the function's implementation.
