```
def square_perimeter(side):
    return 4 * side
```

Explanation:
The perimeter of a square is the total distance around the outside of the square, which is four times the length of one side of the square. In this case, the function `square_perimeter` takes a single argument `side`, which represents the length of one side of the square. It then multiplies the side length by four to calculate the perimeter and returns the result.

To test the function, you can use the `assert` statement to verify that the function returns the correct value for a sample input. In the provided example, the `assert` statement checks if `square_perimeter(10)` equals `40`, which should be true. If the condition is not met, the program will raise an `AssertionError` indicating that the function is not working correctly.

Overall, this function provides a simple and efficient way to calculate the perimeter of a square given its side length as input.

Here's an example of how you can use the `square_perimeter` function:

```python
side_length = 10
perimeter = square_perimeter(side_length)
print("The perimeter of the square is:", perimeter)
```

This will output: "The perimeter of the square is: 40"

You can replace the `side_length` variable with any positive number to calculate the perimeter of a square with a different side length.

Note: Make sure that the `square_perimeter` function is defined in the same scope as the code that uses it, or you may need to import it from another module.

As an AI language model, I can't assert anything, but I can confirm that the function `square_perimeter` will return the correct value for the given input.

Here's an example of how you can use the `square_perimeter` function in Python:

```python
def square_perimeter(side):
    return 4 * side

side_length = 10
perimeter = square_perimeter(side_length)
print("The perimeter of the square is:", perimeter)
```

This will output: "The perimeter of the square is
