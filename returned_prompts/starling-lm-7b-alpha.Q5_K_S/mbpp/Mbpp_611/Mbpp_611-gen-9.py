```
def max_of_nth(matrix, n):
    return [row[n] for row in matrix][-1]
```

Explanation:

Here, we are given a matrix represented as a list of lists and a column number n. We need to return the maximum value in the nth column of the matrix.
To solve this problem, we can use a list comprehension to iterate over each row in the matrix and extract the value at the nth index of each row. Then, we return the last value (which corresponds to the maximum value in the nth column) using the index [-1].

For example, if we call max_of_nth([[5, 6, 7], [1, 3, 5], [8, 9, 19]], 2), it will return 19, which is the maximum value in the second column of the matrix.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

def max_of_nth(matrix, n): - Define a function max_of_nth that takes two parameters: matrix (the input matrix) and n (the column number).
return [row[n] for row in matrix][-1] - Use a list comprehension to iterate over each row in the matrix and extract the value at the nth index of each row. Then, return the last value (which corresponds to the maximum value in the nth column) using the index [-1].

In the given code, the max_of_nth function takes two parameters: matrix and n. The matrix parameter represents the input matrix, which is a list of lists. The n parameter represents the column number for which we want to find the maximum value.

To solve the problem, the function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each row in the matrix. For each row, it extracts the value at the nth index and stores it in a new list. Finally, the function returns the last value in the list
