print(count_element_in_list([[1, 3], [5, 7], [1, 11], [1, 15, 7]],1))
# Expected Output:
# 3
"""

# This will give the correct output. The count_element_in_list function iterates over each sublist in the input list and checks if the given element is present in the sublist. If the element is present, it increments the count by 1. After iterating through all sublists, it returns the final count.

The test case provided in the question uses the count_element_in_list function to count the number of sublists containing the element 1 in the input list [[1, 3], [5, 7], [1, 11], [1, 15, 7]]. The expected output is 3, which is the correct count of sublists containing the element 1.

The error "TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable" occurs because the code is trying to iterate over an integer object, which is not iterable. This error can be fixed by modifying the count_element_in_list function as shown above, which correctly iterates over sublists and counts the occurrences of the given element.

The count_element_in_list function correctly solves the problem of counting the number of sublists containing a particular element in
