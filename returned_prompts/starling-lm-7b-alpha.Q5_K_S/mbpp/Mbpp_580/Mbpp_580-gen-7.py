# As a beginner in Python, I don't understand the above code and don't understand how it works. It would be great if you could explain the code to me in detail.
# Here's an example:
# Input: (4, 5, (7, 6, (2, 4)), 6, 8)
# Expected Output: (4, (6, (2, 4)), 6, 8)

# The code is a function called "extract_even" that takes a mixed tuple as input. It uses recursion to iterate through the tuple and remove any elements that are not divisible by 2 (i.e., uneven numbers). Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

# 1. The function checks if the current element is a tuple using the "isinstance" function. If it is, the function calls itself recursively with the current tuple as the input. This allows the function to handle nested tuples.

# 2. If the current element is not a tuple, the function checks if it is an uneven number by using the modulo operator (%). If the element is uneven, it is deleted from the tuple using the "del" statement. The index of the element is obtained using the "index" method of the tuple, and the element at that index is deleted.

# 3. The function continues to iterate through the tuple, removing uneven elements until it reaches the end of the tuple. The modified tuple is then returned.

# In the given example, the function is called with the input (4, 5, (7, 6, (2, 4)), 6, 8). The function removes the uneven elements (5, 7) from the tuple and returns the modified tuple (4, (6, (2,
