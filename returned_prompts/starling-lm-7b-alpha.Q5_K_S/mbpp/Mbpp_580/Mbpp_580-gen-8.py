"""
The function extract_even() takes a nested tuple as an argument and returns a new tuple with only the even elements.
It uses recursion to traverse through the tuple and filter out the even elements.
Here's the code:

def extract_even(t):
    result = tuple()
    for elem in t:
        if isinstance(elem, tuple):
            result += (elem for elem in extract_even(elem) if elem % 2 == 0)
        elif elem % 2 == 0:
            result += elem,
    return result

The function iterates through each element in the input tuple. If an element is a tuple, the function recursively calls itself to extract even elements from the nested tuple. If an element is not a tuple and is even, it is added to the result tuple.

To test the function, you can use the assert statement provided in the question:

assert extract_even((4, 5, (7, 6, (2, 4)), 6, 8)) == (4, (6, (2, 4)), 6, 8)

This assertion checks if the function correctly extracts even elements from the given nested tuple and returns the expected result.

In the above code, we define the function extract_even() that takes a nested tuple as an argument and returns a new tuple with only the even elements.
We use recursion to traverse through the tuple and filter out the even elements.
For each element in the input tuple, if the element is a tuple, we recursively call the extract_even() function
