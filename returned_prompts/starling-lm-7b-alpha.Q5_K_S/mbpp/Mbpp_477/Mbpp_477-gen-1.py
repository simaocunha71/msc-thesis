```
def is_lower(string):
    return string.lower()
```

Explanation:
The `lower()` method is a string method in Python that returns a copy of the original string in all lowercase letters. By using `lower()` method, we can convert the given string to lowercase. The `is_lower` function takes a string as an argument and returns the lowercase version of the string using `lower()` method. The `assert` statement is used to check if the `is_lower` function correctly converts the string to lowercase.

Here's an example usage of the `is_lower` function:
```python
assert is_lower("InValid") == "invalid"  # This will pass because "InValid" becomes "invalid" when converted to lowercase
```

The `assert` statement checks if the `is_lower` function returns the expected result for the given input. In this case, the expected result is "invalid" for the input "InValid". The `==` operator is used to compare the actual result of the function with the expected result. If the actual result matches the expected result, the assertion passes and the program continues execution. Otherwise, an AssertionError is raised, indicating that the function is not working correctly.

Overall, the `is_lower` function along with the `assert` statement can be used to ensure that the given string is correctly converted to lowercase.
