# The function first sorts the tuples based on the first element in the tuple. Then, it iterates through the sorted tuples and updates the minimum product if a smaller product is found. The time complexity is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, and the space complexity is O(1) as the function only uses a fixed amount of space to store the minimum product and the sorted tuples.

# The function uses the sorted() function to sort the tuples based on the first element in the tuple. The key argument to the sorted() function is a lambda function that takes a tuple as input and returns the first element of the tuple. This ensures that the tuples are sorted based on the first element in the tuple.
