Explanation:
The function `sort_counter` takes a dictionary `d` as input. It uses the `sorted` function to sort the dictionary by value. The `sorted` function returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a key-value pair from the dictionary. The `key` parameter is a lambda function that specifies the sorting criterion, in this case, the value of each key-value pair. The function `sort_counter` then returns the sorted list of tuples, effectively sorting the dictionary by value.

To test the function, you can use the `assert` statement to check if the result of `sort_counter` on the given dictionary matches the expected output.

Here's an example of how you can use the `sort_counter` function:
```python
d = {'Math':81, 'Physics':83, 'Chemistry':87}
sorted_d = sort_counter(d)
print(sorted_d)  # Output: [('Chemistry', 87), ('Physics', 83), ('Math', 81)]
```

In this example, the `d` dictionary contains key-value pairs representing marks in different subjects. The `sort_counter` function sorts the dictionary by value, resulting in a list of tuples where each tuple contains a subject and its corresponding mark. The output shows that the dictionary has been sorted in ascending order of marks, with the highest mark appearing first.

This function is useful when you need to sort a dictionary based on its values, which can be helpful for various data manipulation tasks.

Note: The `sorted` function returns a new sorted list of tuples, leaving the original dictionary unchanged.

To sort a dictionary in-place (i.e., modifying the original dictionary), you can use the `sorteddict` module, which provides the `sort_dict` function. Here's an example of how you can use it:
```python
from sorteddict import SortedDict

d = SortedDict(d)
print(d)  # Output: {'Chemistry': 87, 'Phys
