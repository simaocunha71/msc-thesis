```
def sort_counter(d):
    return sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
```

Explanation:
The `sort_counter` function is defined to take a dictionary `d` as input. It uses the built-in `sorted` function to sort the dictionary's items by value. The `key` parameter of the `sorted` function is set to a lambda function that returns the value of each item. This ensures that the items are sorted based on their values. The function then returns the sorted items as a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a key-value pair from the dictionary.

To test the function, you can use the `assert` statement to check if the function correctly sorts the dictionary. In this case, the expected output for the `sort_counter` function when given the dictionary `{'Math':81, 'Physics':83, 'Chemistry':87}` is `[('Chemistry', 87), ('Physics', 83), ('Math', 81)]`. The `assert` statement confirms that the actual output of the function matches the expected output.

Overall, this solution provides a simple and efficient way to sort a dictionary by value using Python's built-in functions.

def sort_counter(d):
    return sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])

This code defines a function called `sort_counter` that takes a dictionary `d` as input. The `sorted` function is used to sort the items of the dictionary based on their values. The `key` parameter of the `sorted` function is set to a lambda function that returns the value of each item. This ensures that the items are sorted based on their values.
