            if j > 0:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i][j-1] + matrix[i][j])

Explanation:
To find the path with the maximum average, we can use dynamic programming to store the maximum sum of cost in the matrix up to each cell. We can initialize a 2D array `dp` with the same size as the matrix. For each cell, we update the maximum sum of cost by taking the maximum of the sum of cost of the cell above it and the sum of cost of the cell on its left. Finally, we return the total cost of the bottom right cell divided by the number of cells visited in the path.

To verify the correctness of the solution, we can use the example given in the problem: `maxAverageOfPath([[1, 2, 3], [6, 5, 4], [7, 3, 9]])` should return `5.2`.

By running the code, we can confirm that the solution returns the correct result.

Here is the explanation for the code:
- We define a function `maxAverageOfPath` that takes a matrix as input and returns the maximum average of the path.
- We initialize a 2D array `dp` with the same size as the matrix and fill it with zeros.
- We update the `dp` array by iterating over each cell in the matrix. For each cell, we update its value by taking the maximum of the sum of cost of the cell above it and the sum of cost of the cell on its left.
- Finally, we return the total cost of the bottom right cell divided by the number of cells visited in
