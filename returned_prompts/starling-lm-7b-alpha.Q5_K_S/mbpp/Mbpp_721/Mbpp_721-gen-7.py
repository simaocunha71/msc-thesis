Explanation:
The problem asks to find a path with the maximum average cost over all existing paths from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell in a square matrix. We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem.

We initialize a 2D array `dp` of the same size as the input matrix to store the maximum cost of each cell in the path. We start by setting the first row and the first column of `dp` to be the corresponding elements in the input matrix.

Then, we iterate over the remaining cells in the matrix. For each cell, we choose the maximum cost from its left neighbor and its top neighbor in `dp`, and add the cost of the current cell to it. This is because we can only move right or down from each cell.

Finally, we return the total cost of the bottom-right cell divided by the total number of cells in the path (which is m + n - 1) as the maximum average cost.

The time complexity of this solution is O(m * n) since we only need to iterate over the matrix once.

The space complexity of this solution is also O(m * n) since we need to store the maximum cost for each cell in the matrix.

Overall, this solution provides a straightforward and efficient approach to find the maximum average cost of a path in a square matrix using dynamic programming.
