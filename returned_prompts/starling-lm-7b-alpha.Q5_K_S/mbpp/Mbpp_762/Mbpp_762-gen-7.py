def check_monthnumber_number(month):
    return month in [4,6,9,11]

# This code is inefficient since it uses a list to check for the value of the given month number.
# It would be better to use a dictionary instead, as this would allow for a faster lookup time.
# Additionally, the function could be made more robust by checking if the given month number is within the range of 1 to 12.

# Here is an updated version of the function that incorporates these improvements:

def check_monthnumber_number(month):
    months = {1: False, 2: False, 3: False, 5: False, 7: False, 8: False, 10: False, 12: False, 4: True, 6: True, 9: True, 11: True}
    return months.get(month, False)

# This version of the function uses a dictionary to store the month numbers and their corresponding boolean values.
# It then uses the get() method to retrieve the value for the given month number, or False if the month number is not present in the dictionary.

# Note that this version of the function is still not ideal, as it requires a dictionary lookup for every month number.
# A more efficient approach would be to use a bitwise operation to check if the month number is odd or even, as only odd months have 30 days.

# Here is an example of how this could be implemented:

def check_monthnumber_number(month):
    return (month % 2 == 0) and month in [4,6,9,11]

# This version of the function uses the modulo operator to determine if the month number is odd or even.
# It then checks if the month number is one of the months with 30 days (4,6,9,11), and returns True if both conditions are met, and False otherwise.

# This implementation is more efficient than the previous versions, as it only requires a single modulo operation and a single membership check.

# However, it is worth noting that this implementation may not be suitable for all use cases, as it relies on the assumption that the month number is a whole number.
