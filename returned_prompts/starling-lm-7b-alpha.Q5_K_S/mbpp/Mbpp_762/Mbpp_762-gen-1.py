```
def check_monthnumber_number(month):
    months = [4, 6, 9, 11]
    return True if month in months else False
```

This function will return True if the given month is in the list of months that have 30 days (4, 6, 9, 11), and False otherwise.

Explanation:
The function `check_monthnumber_number` takes a month number as input and checks if it is present in the list `months`. If the month number is in the list, it means the month has 30 days, so the function returns True. If the month number is not in the list, it means the month does not have 30 days, so the function returns False.

The list `months` contains the month numbers that have 30 days (4, 6, 9, 11). By checking if the input month number is in this list, we can determine if the month has 30 days or not.

The assert statement `assert check_monthnumber_number(6)==True` is used to test the function. It checks if the function correctly identifies that the month number 6 (June) is in the list of months with 30 days and returns True, as expected.

To use this function, you can simply call it with a month number as an argument, like `check_monthnumber_number(7)`. It will return True if the month has 30 days, and False otherwise.

Note: The function assumes that the month numbers are given from 1 to 12, following the standard numbering of months in the Gregorian calendar.

Here are some additional examples of how to use the `check_monthnumber_number` function:

```python
print(check_monthnumber_number(4))  # Output: True
print(check_monthnumber_number(7))  # Output: False
print(check_monthnumber_number(12))  # Output: False
```

These examples demonstrate that the function correctly identifies the months with 30 days and returns the appropriate results.

This implementation of the `check_monthnumber_number` function provides a simple and efficient way to determine if a given month has 30
