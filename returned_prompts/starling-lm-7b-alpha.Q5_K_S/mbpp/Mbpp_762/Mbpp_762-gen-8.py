"""
This code defines a function called check_monthnumber_number. It takes a month number as input and checks if the month number is in the list of months that contain 30 days. If the month number is in the list, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

The list of months that contain 30 days is defined as months = [1,3,5,7,8,10,12]. These are the months that have 30 days.

The function check_monthnumber_number(month_number) checks if the given month_number is in the months list. If it is, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

The driver program at the end of the code tests the function by calling it with different month numbers and printing the results.
