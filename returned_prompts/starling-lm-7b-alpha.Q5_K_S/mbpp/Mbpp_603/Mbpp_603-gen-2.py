                cnt += 1

```

# This code is wrong, because it checks if a number is a lucid number by counting how many times it divides another number, but this is not the definition of lucid numbers.

# A lucid number is a number that only divides itself and 1. The correct code for this problem is:

```python
def get_lucid(n):
    lucid = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if all(i % j != 0 or j == i for j in range(1, i)):
            lucid.append(i)
    return lucid
```

# The above code iterates through each number from 1 to n, and then checks if it only divides itself and 1. If it does, it is added to the lucid list.
