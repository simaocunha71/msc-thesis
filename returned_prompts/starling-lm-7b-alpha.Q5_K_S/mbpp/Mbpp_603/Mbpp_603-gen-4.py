This code defines a function `get_ludic` that takes an integer `num` as input and returns a list of all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to `num`. 

A lucid number is a number that is divisible by all prime numbers less than or equal to its square root. In other words, a number is lucid if it is divisible by all prime numbers from 2 to its square root. 

The function uses a `for` loop to iterate over each number from 1 to `num`. For each number, it checks if it is divisible by all prime numbers from 2 to its square root using the `all` function. If the condition is true, the number is added to the result list. 

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) because it iterates over each number from 1 to `num`. The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of additional memory to store the result list. 

To test the function, you can use the provided assertion `assert get_ludic(10) == [1, 2, 3, 5, 7]`, which checks if the function correctly returns the expected list of lucid numbers for the input `10`.

Overall, this solution efficiently finds all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to a given integer using a simple algorithm.
