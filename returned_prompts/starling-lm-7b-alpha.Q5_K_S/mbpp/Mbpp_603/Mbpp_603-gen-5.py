This function uses a loop to iterate through all numbers from 1 to the given limit. It checks if the number is equal to 1, in which case it is a lucid number and is added to the `lucid_nums` list. Otherwise, it finds the smallest factor of the number and checks if it is equal to the number itself. If it is, the number is added to the `lucid_nums` list. Finally, the function returns the `lucid_nums` list.

The assertion `assert get_lucid(10) == [1, 2, 3, 5, 7]` checks if the function correctly returns the list of lucid numbers smaller than or equal to 10, which should be `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7]`.

You can test the function by calling it with different limit values and checking if it returns the expected list of lucid numbers.

For example, calling `get_lucid(15)` should return `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13]`, as these are all the lucid numbers smaller than or equal to 15.

To visualize the logic of the function, you can print the `factor` variable inside the loop to see how it finds the smallest factor of each number.

Here's an example of how you can print the `factor` variable
