def get_lucid(n):
    return [i for i in range(1, n + 1) if not any(i % j == 0 for j in range(2, int(i ** 0.5) + 1))]
```

Explanation:
The function `get_lucid` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to `n`. A lucid number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself. To find all lucid numbers, the function uses a list comprehension to iterate through all numbers from 1 to `n`. For each number, it checks if there are any divisors (other than 1 and itself) that evenly divide it. If there are no such divisors, the number is added to the result list. The function uses the `any` function and a generator expression to check if there are any divisors. The range `range(2, int(i ** 0.5) + 1)` is used to only check divisors up to the square root of `i`, as divisors larger than the square root are guaranteed to not exist.

The given assertion `assert get_lucid(10) == [1, 2, 3, 5, 7]` checks if the function correctly returns the list `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7]` when `n` is 10. This is expected since the lucid numbers smaller than or equal to 10 are indeed 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7.

Note: The function assumes that the input `n` is a positive integer.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of how the function works:

1. The function `get_lucid` takes an integer `n` as input.
2. It initializes an empty list to store the lucid numbers.
3. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through all numbers from 1 to `n`.
4. For each number, it checks if there are any divisors (other than 1 and itself) that evenly divide it.
5. If there are no such divisors, the number is added to the result list.
