def get_lucid(num):
    res = []
    for i in range(1, num+1):

This function works by iterating over all numbers from 1 to the given number, and checks if a number can be divided evenly by all numbers from 1 to itself (inclusive). If it can, the number is added to the result list. Finally, the result list is returned.

The function uses a generator expression to create a list of all numbers from 1 to the given number, and the `all()` function to check if a number is divisible by all numbers in the range. If the condition is true, the number is added to the result list.

The time complexity of the function is O(n^2) because it checks divisibility for each number in the range, and the space complexity is O(n) because it stores all the lucid numbers in a list.

The function can be tested using the provided assertion, which checks if the function correctly returns the lucid numbers smaller than or equal to 10.

This implementation is a straightforward approach to solve the problem, but there might be more efficient ways to find all lucid numbers.
