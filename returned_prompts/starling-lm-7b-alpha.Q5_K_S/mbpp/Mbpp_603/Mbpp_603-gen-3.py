```
def get_lucid(n):
    result = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        tmp = i
        while tmp <= n:
            result.append(tmp)
            tmp *= 2
    return result
```

In the above code, we iterate through each number in the range from 1 to n (inclusive). For each number, we use a while loop to calculate the next lucid number by doubling the current number. We keep appending the lucid number to the result list until the lucid number becomes larger than n. Finally, we return the result list.

For example, if we call `get_lucid(10)`, the function will return `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7]` because these are all the lucid numbers smaller than or equal to 10.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) because we are iterating through each number in the range from 1 to n and performing a multiplication operation in each iteration.

The space complexity is O(n) because we are storing all the lucid numbers in a list.

Overall, this solution efficiently finds all the lucid numbers smaller than or equal to the given integer.

```python
def get_lucid(n):
    result = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        tmp = i
        while tmp <= n:
            result.append(tmp)
            tmp *= 2
    return result
```

This function uses a loop to iterate through each number from 1 to n (inclusive). For each number, it calculates the next lucid number by doubling the current number and appends it to the result list. This process continues until the lucid number becomes larger than n. Finally, the function returns the result list containing all the lucid numbers smaller than or equal to n.

For example, if we call `get_lucid(10)`, the function will return `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7]` because these are the lucid numbers smaller than or equal to 10.
