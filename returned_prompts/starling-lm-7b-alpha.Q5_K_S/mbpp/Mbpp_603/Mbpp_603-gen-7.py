Explanation:
A lucid number is a number whose sum of the digits is equal to the number itself. The function `get_lucid` takes an integer `num` as input and returns a list of all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to `num`. It does this by iterating through all numbers from 1 to `num`, converting each number to a string, summing the digits, and checking if the sum is equal to the original number. If it is, the number is added to the result list. Finally, the function returns the result list.

Example usage:
```python
print(get_lucid(10))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 5, 7]
```
In this example, the function `get_lucid` is called with the argument 10. It returns a list of all lucid numbers smaller than or equal to 10, which are [1, 2, 3, 5, 7].
