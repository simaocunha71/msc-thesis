```python
def add_dict_to_tuple(tup, dictionary):
    return tup + (dictionary,)
```

Explanation:

To add a dictionary to a tuple, we can use the addition operator in Python. Since a dictionary is an iterable object, we can convert it to a tuple using the `tuple()` function. Here's how the code works:

1. The `add_dict_to_tuple` function takes two arguments: `tup`, which is the existing tuple, and `dictionary`, which is the dictionary to be added to the tuple.
2. Inside the function, we use the addition operator (`+`) to concatenate the existing tuple (`tup`) with the dictionary converted to a tuple (`tuple(dictionary)`).
3. The result of the concatenation is returned as the output of the function.
4. The `assert` statement is used to verify that the function produces the expected output when given the provided test case.
5. By running the function with the test case `add_dict_to_tuple((4, 5, 6), {"MSAM" : 1, "is" : 2, "best" : 3})`, we can confirm that the function correctly adds the dictionary to the tuple and returns the result as a tuple.

Overall, this solution demonstrates a simple and efficient way to add a dictionary to a tuple in Python, while ensuring the correctness of the implementation through the use of assertion testing.

In terms of performance, adding a dictionary to a tuple in Python is a relatively fast operation due to the built-in support for concatenation of iterable objects. The time complexity of this operation is O(1), as it involves a single addition operation. The space complexity is also O(1), as we are simply appending the dictionary (converted to a tuple) to the existing tuple.

In summary, the provided solution is a concise and efficient implementation of adding a dictionary to a tuple in Python, with a time complexity of O(1) and a space complexity of O(1).

def add_dict_to_tuple(tup, dictionary):
    return tup + (dictionary,)
