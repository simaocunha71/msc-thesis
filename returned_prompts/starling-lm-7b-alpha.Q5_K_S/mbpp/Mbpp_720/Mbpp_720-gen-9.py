def add_dict_to_tuple(tup, dict_):
    return tup + (dict_,)

# Test
print(add_dict_to_tuple((4, 5, 6), {"MSAM" : 1, "is" : 2, "best" : 3} ))
# Output: (4, 5, 6, {'MSAM': 1, 'is': 2, 'best': 3})

# Explanation
The function `add_dict_to_tuple` takes two arguments: `tup` and `dict_`. It uses the `+` operator to concatenate the tuple `tup` with a new tuple that contains only the dictionary `dict_`. The result is a new tuple that includes the elements of both the original tuple and the dictionary.

In the provided example, the function is called with the tuple `(4, 5, 6)` and the dictionary `{"MSAM" : 1, "is" : 2, "best" : 3}`. The function concatenates these two values into a new tuple `(4, 5, 6, {'MSAM': 1, 'is': 2, 'best': 3})`, which is then printed as the output.

The assertion in the question confirms that the output of the function matches the expected result.

Note that the `+` operator is used here to concatenate the tuple and the dictionary into a new tuple. This is a common and idiomatic way to concatenate tuples in Python.

It's important to note that in Python, tuples are immutable, meaning you cannot modify their contents once they are created. This is why the function concatenates the tuple with a new tuple, rather than modifying the original tuple directly.

This solution works regardless of the size of the tuple or dictionary, and can handle any combination of integers, floats, strings, lists, and dictionaries.

Overall, this function provides a straightforward and efficient way to add a dictionary to a tuple in Python.
