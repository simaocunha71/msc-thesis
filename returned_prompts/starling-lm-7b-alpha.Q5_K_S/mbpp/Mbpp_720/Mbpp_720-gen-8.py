Here is a function that does what you need:

def add_dict_to_tuple(tup, dict_):
    return tuple(tup) + (dict_,)
"""

# Here's a brief explanation of what's going on in the code:
# We start by defining a function called add_dict_to_tuple that takes in two parameters: tup (the tuple) and dict_ (the dictionary).
# Inside the function, we use the '+' operator to concatenate the original tuple (tup) with the dictionary (dict_). This operation is only possible if the tuple is converted to a list, which is why we use the 'tuple()' function to convert the tuple back into a list.
# The resulting concatenated list is then converted back into a tuple using the 'tuple()' function and returned as the result of the function.

# This approach allows us to add the dictionary to the tuple while still maintaining the original tuple's structure, and the assertion provided in the question confirms that the function works correctly.

# When you run this function with the provided input (add_dict_to_tuple((4, 5, 6), {"MSAM" : 1, "is" : 2, "best" : 3})), the output will be (4, 5, 6, {'MSAM': 1, 'is': 2, 'best': 3}), which matches the expected result.

# It's worth noting that in Python, tuples and dictionaries are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed after they are created. This is why we need to convert the tuple to a list in order to concatenate it with the dictionary, and then convert it back to a tuple.

# Additionally, it's important to note that the order of the elements in the resulting tuple is preserved, meaning that the original tuple elements come first, followed by the dictionary elements.

# I hope this explanation helps you understand how the code works and why it produces the desired output. Let me know if you have any more questions!
