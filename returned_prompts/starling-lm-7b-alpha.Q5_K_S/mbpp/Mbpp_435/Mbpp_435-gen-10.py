"""
To solve this problem we can define a function that takes a number as an argument and returns its last digit. We can do this by using the modulus operator to get the remainder of the number divided by 10, which gives us the last digit. For example, if we call the function with the number 123, it will return 3, because 123 divided by 10 gives a remainder of 3.

To test the function, we can define a test case that calls the function with the number 123 and checks if the result is equal to 3. The assert statement will raise an error if the result is not equal to 3, indicating that the function is not working correctly. However, if the result is equal to 3, the assert statement will pass and the test case will be successful.

Finally, we can call the test_last_Digit function to run the test case and verify that the function is working correctly. If the test case is successful, no error message will be displayed.
