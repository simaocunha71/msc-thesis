Here is one way you can define the function:

```python
def last_Digit(num):
    return num % 10
```

To use it, you can call it with a number like so:

```python
print(last_Digit(123))  # Outputs: 3
```

This will return the last digit of the number, as the modulo operator `%` returns the remainder of dividing two numbers.
In this case, dividing by 10 will return the units digit of the original number.

Here's a demonstration of the function's behavior:

```python
print(last_Digit(123))  # Outputs: 3
print(last_Digit(12345))  # Outputs: 5
print(last_Digit(123456))  # Outputs: 6
```

As you can see, it correctly extracts the last digit from each of the test cases.

```python
def last_Digit(num):
    return num % 10
```

Here's a demonstration of the function's behavior:

```python
print(last_Digit(123))  # Outputs: 3
print(last_Digit(12345))  # Outputs: 5
print(last_Digit(123456))  # Outputs: 6
```

As you can see, it correctly extracts the last digit from each of the test cases.
