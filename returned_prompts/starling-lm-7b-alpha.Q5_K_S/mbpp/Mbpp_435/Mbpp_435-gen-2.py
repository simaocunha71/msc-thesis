"""
Explanation:
The function takes a number as input and returns the remainder of the division of the number by 10. The last digit of a number is the remainder of the division of the number by 10.
"""

"""
Time complexity: O(1), since the remainder operation is constant time.
"""

"""
Space complexity: O(1), since we are only using a single variable to store the remainder.
