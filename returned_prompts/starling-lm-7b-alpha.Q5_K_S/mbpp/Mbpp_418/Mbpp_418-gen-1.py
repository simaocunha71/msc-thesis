The time complexity of the above function is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. This is because we traverse the list once.
The space complexity is O(1), as we use a fixed amount of extra memory to store the maximum length and the maximum element.

"""
Alternatively, we can use Python's built-in functions to achieve the same result:
"""

def Find_Max(list):
    max_ele = max(list, key=len)
    return max_ele

# Test
assert(Find_Max([['A'],['A','B'],['A','B','C']]) == ['A','B','C'])

"""
The time complexity of this function is also O(n), but the space complexity is O(1).
"""

"""
It's important to note that Python's built-in functions are usually implemented in C, and can be faster than writing our own Python functions.
"""

"""
In this problem, we are finding the maximum length of a string in a list of strings. The key function in the max function is used to specify a custom comparator for determining the maximum element. Here, we use the built-in len function as the comparator to find the string with the maximum length.
"""

"""
We can also use list comprehension to write the function:
"""

def Find_Max(list):
    return max([i for i in list], key=len)

# Test
assert(Find_Max([['A'],['A','B'],['A','B','C']]) == ['A','B','C'])

"""
This approach has the same time and space complexity as the previous methods, but it is more Pythonic and concise.
