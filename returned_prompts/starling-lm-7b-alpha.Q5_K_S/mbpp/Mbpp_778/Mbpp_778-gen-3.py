Here's one way to do it:

def pack_consecutive_duplicates(lst):
    res = []
    cur = []
    for e in lst:
        if not cur or cur[-1] != e:
            cur = [e]
        else:
            cur.append(e)
        if len(cur) == 2:
            res.append(cur)
            cur = []
    if cur:
        res.append(cur)
    return res

And here's a slightly more efficient version that does not create an intermediate list:

def pack_consecutive_duplicates_v2(lst):
    res = []
    for e in lst:
        if not res or res[-1][-1] != e:
            res.append([e])
        else:
            res[-1].append(e)
            if len(res[-1]) == 2:
                res.pop()
    return res

Both functions are O(n)

The first function creates a new list for each sublist. The second function does not create a new list until the sublist has at least two elements, which reduces the number of allocations by about half.

The second function uses the fact that we only need to append to the end of the sublist, and never insert in the middle. So we can reuse the existing sublist when appending, and only create a new sublist when we need to start a new one.

In the second function, `res` is a list of lists. When the last element of a sublist is the same as the current element, we append the current element to the end of the last sublist. If the length of the last sublist becomes 2, then the last sublist is no longer consecutive, so we remove it from `res` and create a new sublist to start a new consecutive sequence.

This solution is inspired by the "Yet Another Simple O(n) Pack Consecutive Duplicates Solution" by user "dawud" in the Python Cookbook.
