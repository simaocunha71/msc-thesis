"""
This function takes in a list of integers and an integer as input. It then iterates over the list and checks if any of the numbers are greater than the input integer. If it finds such a number, it immediately returns False. If it goes through the entire list without finding a number greater than the input integer, it returns True. The function's purpose is to determine if the input integer is greater than all of the numbers in the list.
"""

"""
To use this function, you can define it in your Python script or program. Here's an example of how to use it:

```python
def check_greater(arr: List[int], num: int) -> bool:
    for x in arr:
        if x > num:
            return False
    return True
```

You can then call the function with a list of integers and an integer as arguments. For example, to check if the number 4 is greater than all of the numbers in the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], you can use the following code:

```python
assert check_greater([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 4) == False
```

This will assert that the function returns False as expected. If the function were to return True instead, the assertion would fail and an error message would be raised.

The purpose of this function is to check if a given number is greater than all of the elements in a given array of integers. It does this by iterating over the array and comparing each element to
