Here is a simple solution to the problem. It's based on the fact that in a sorted array, if an element appears an odd number of times, then it must be the only element that does not appear twice (or more) somewhere else.

```python
def search(nums):
    '''
    :type nums: List[int]
    :rtype: int
    '''
    if len(nums) == 0:
        return -1
    if len(nums) == 1:
        return nums[0]
    if len(nums) == 2:
        if nums[0] == nums[1]:
            return -1
        else:
            return nums[0]

    left = 0
    right = len(nums) - 1
    while left < right:
        if nums[left] == nums[right]:
            left += 1
        else:
            return nums[left]
        right -= 1
```

This function first checks if the length of the array is 0 or 1, in which case the result is obvious. If the length is 2, it checks if the two elements are equal. If they are, then there is no such element, otherwise it returns the first element.

For larger arrays, it uses two pointers, one starting from the left and one starting from the right. It continues until the two pointers meet. If the elements at the left and right pointers are equal, it increments the left pointer. Otherwise, it returns the element at the left pointer, because it is the only element that appears only once.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), and the space complexity is O(1).

    :type nums: List[int]
    :rtype: int
    '''
    if len(nums) == 0:
        return -1
    if len(nums) == 1:
        return nums[0]
    if len(nums) == 2:
        if nums[0] == nums[1]:
            return -1
        else:
            return nums[0
