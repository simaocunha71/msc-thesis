Here's a Python function that finds the element that appears only once in a sorted array:

```python
def search(arr):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1

    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2

        if arr[mid] == arr[mid+1]:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid

    return arr[left]
```

This function uses a binary search algorithm to find the middle element of the array. It then compares the middle element with its adjacent element. If they are equal, it moves the left pointer to the right of the middle element. If they are not equal, it moves the right pointer to the left of the middle element. This process continues until the left pointer is equal to the right pointer, indicating that the element at that position is the only element that appears once in the array.

The function returns the element at the left pointer position, which is the only element that appears once in the array.

To test the function, you can use the `assert` statement and provide a sample array. For example, `assert search([1,1,2,2,3]) == 3` asserts that the function correctly returns the element 3 when given the array [1,1,2,2,3].

You can run this code in a Python environment to verify its correctness.

```python
def search(arr):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1

    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2

        if arr[mid] == arr[mid+1]:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid

    return arr[left]

assert search([1,1,2,2,3]) == 3
```

When you run this code, the `assert` statement will pass and no error will be raised, indicating that the function correctly finds the element that appears only once in the array.

```python
True
```

```python
def search(arr):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1

    while left < right:
        mid
