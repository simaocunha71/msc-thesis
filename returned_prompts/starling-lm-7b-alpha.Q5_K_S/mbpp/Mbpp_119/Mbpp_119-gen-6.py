def search(arr):
    '''
    Function to find the element that appears only once in a sorted array
    '''
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n-1):
        if arr[i] != arr[i+1]:

    return arr[-1]
```

Explanation:

In a sorted array, an element that appears only once will be the first element if it is less than the previous elements and the last element if it is greater than the next elements. Therefore, we can find the element by scanning the array from left to right, or from right to left.

In this function, we scan the array from left to right, and return the first element that is not equal to the next element. If all the elements are the same, we return the last element.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), which is optimal.

Note: This function assumes that the array is non-empty and all the elements are unique.

Here is an example usage of the function:

```python
assert search([1,1,2,2,3]) == 3
```

In this example, the array is [1, 1, 2, 2, 3], and the element 3 appears only once, so the function returns 3.

The assert statement is used to check if the function returns the expected result. If the function does not return the expected result, the assert statement will raise an AssertionError.

In this case, the assert statement checks if the function returns 3 when the array is [1, 1, 2, 2, 3]. If the function does not return 3, the assert statement will raise an AssertionError, indicating that the function is incorrect.

This helps ensure that the function is correct and works as expected.
