def ascii_value(character):
    return ord(character)


# Driver code
print(ascii_value('A'))


"""
Time Complexity: O(1)
Space Complexity: O(1)
"""

# In the above code, we define a function `ascii_value` that takes a character as an input and uses the `ord()` function to convert the character into its ASCII value. The `ord()` function returns an integer representing the Unicode character. We then print the result of calling the `ascii_value` function with the character 'A'.
#
# The time complexity of the code is O(1) because the `ord()` function has a constant time complexity, regardless of the input size. The space complexity is also O(1) because the function only uses a fixed amount of space to store the input character.
