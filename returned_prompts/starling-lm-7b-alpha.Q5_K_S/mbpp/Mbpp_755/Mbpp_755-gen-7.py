```
def second_smallest(numbers):
    numbers.sort()
    return numbers[1]
```

Explanation:
To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Sort the list of numbers in ascending order using the `sort()` method. This will rearrange the list so that the smallest number is at the beginning and the largest number is at the end.
2. Return the second element in the sorted list using `numbers[1]`. Since Python uses zero-based indexing, the second element is at index 1.

The `assert` statement at the end of the code is a way to check if the function is working correctly. In this case, it checks if the `second_smallest()` function correctly returns -2 when given the list `[1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2]`. If the assertion fails, an error will be raised.

By following these steps and using the provided code, you can find the second smallest number in a list.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

- The `def` keyword is used to define a function called `second_smallest` that takes a parameter called `numbers`.
- Inside the function, the `numbers.sort()` method is used to sort the list in ascending order.
- The `return` statement is used to return the second element in the sorted list, which is accessed using `numbers[1]`.

Overall, this code provides a simple and efficient solution to find the second smallest number in a list.

Note: It's important to ensure that the input list `numbers` is not empty before using this function, as an empty list would raise an `IndexError` when trying to access `numbers[1]`.

In the provided example, the `assert` statement is used to verify that the function correctly returns -2 when given the list `[1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2]`. If the assertion fails, it means that the function is not working correctly and an error will be raised.

By following these steps and using the provided code, you can find the second smallest number in a list.
