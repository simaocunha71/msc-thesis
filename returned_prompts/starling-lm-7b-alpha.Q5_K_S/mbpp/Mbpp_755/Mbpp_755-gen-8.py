```
def second_smallest(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return lst[1]
```

Explanation:
In the given function, we first sort the list in ascending order. Then we return the second element of the sorted list, which is the second smallest number in the original list. The time complexity of sorting is O(n log n).

Note that if the list has the same second smallest number, the function will return the first occurrence of it.

To verify the function, we can use the `assert` statement to check if the function correctly returns the second smallest number in the given list.

For example, when we call `second_smallest([1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2])`, the function will return `-2`, which is the second smallest number in the list.

This function can be used to find the second smallest number in any given list.

It's important to note that if the list is empty or contains only one element, the function will return `None` or the only element, respectively, as there is no second smallest number in such cases.

It's also worth mentioning that if you need to find the second smallest number in a large list, using a sorting algorithm may not be the most efficient approach. In such cases, you can consider using other algorithms like selection sort or quick select, which have a better time complexity of O(n).

Lastly, it's important to ensure that the input list only contains numeric values, as the function assumes that the list consists of numbers. If the list contains non-numeric values, the function may not work correctly.

In summary, the provided function correctly finds and returns the second smallest number in a given list of numbers. However, it's important to consider the efficiency of the algorithm and ensure the validity of the input list to avoid any unexpected behavior.

Overall, the function is a simple and straightforward solution to the problem of finding the second smallest number in a list.
