```
def merge(list_of_lists):
    return [x[0] for x in list_of_lists], [x[1] for x in list_of_lists]
```

Explanation:
The merge function takes a list of lists as input. It uses list comprehension to create two new lists. The first list comprehension `[x[0] for x in list_of_lists]` creates a new list that contains the first element of each sublist in the original list. The second list comprehension `[x[1] for x in list_of_lists]` creates a new list that contains the second element of each sublist in the original list. The function then returns these two lists as a tuple.

In the example assertion, the function is called with the list `[['x', 'y'], ['a', 'b'], ['m', 'n']]`. The expected result is `[['x', 'a', 'm'], ['y', 'b', 'n']]`. This means that the first element of each sublist in the original list is `['x', 'a', 'm']` and the second element of each sublist is `['y', 'b', 'n']`. The function correctly returns these two lists as a tuple, so the assertion passes.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the total number of elements in the original list. This is because each element in the original list is processed exactly once. The space complexity is also O(n), as the function creates two new lists to store the results.

This function can be useful when you need to merge two elements from each sublist in a list of lists into two separate lists. It provides a concise and efficient way to achieve this using list comprehension.

Overall, this function is a good example of how to use list comprehension to solve a problem in Python. It demonstrates a clear and simple solution to the problem, and the resulting code is both readable and efficient.

The function can be used in a variety of situations where you need to merge two elements from each sublist in a list of lists into two separate lists. It can be particularly useful when working with data that is organized in this way, such as in a spreadsheet or database.
