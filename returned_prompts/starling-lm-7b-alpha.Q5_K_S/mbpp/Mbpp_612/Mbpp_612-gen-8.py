```
def merge(l):
    first_list = []
    second_list = []
    for i in l:
        first_list.append(i[0])
        second_list.append(i[1])
    return [first_list, second_list]
```

Explanation:
The function `merge` takes a list of lists as its argument. It initializes two empty lists, `first_list` and `second_list`. Then it iterates through the input list and appends the first element of each sublist to `first_list` and the second element of each sublist to `second_list`. Finally, it returns a list containing `first_list` and `second_list`.

The assert statement is used to verify the correctness of the function. It checks if the output of `merge` with the input `[['x', 'y'], ['a', 'b'], ['m', 'n']]` is equal to the expected output `[['x', 'a', 'm'], ['y', 'b', 'n']]`.

This solution correctly solves the problem and passes the provided test case.

Here's an example usage of the `merge` function:
```python
print(merge([['x', 'y'], ['a', 'b'], ['m', 'n']]))  # Output: [['x', 'a', 'm'], ['y', 'b', 'n']]
```

In this example, the `merge` function is called with the input `[['x', 'y'], ['a', 'b'], ['m', 'n']]`. The function returns `[['x', 'a', 'm'], ['y', 'b', 'n']]`, which is then printed to the console.

Overall, this solution provides a simple and effective way to merge two elements from multiple sublists into a single list of two lists.

It's worth noting that this solution assumes that each sublist in the input list has exactly two elements. If the input list contains sublists with a different number of elements, the `merge` function may not produce the expected output.
