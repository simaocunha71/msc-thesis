"""
A.
We can define a function called text_lowercase_underscore that takes a string as input and returns True if the string contains sequences of lowercase letters joined with an underscore, and False otherwise. To determine if a string contains lowercase letters, we can use the in operator to check if each lowercase letter is in the string. To check if a string contains an underscore, we can use the find method, which returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified character in the string, and -1 if the character is not found. If the find method returns -1, we know that the string does not contain the specified character, so we can use the any function to check if any of the lowercase letters in the string are joined with an underscore. If the any function returns True, we can return True, otherwise, we can return False.
"""

"""
To test the function, we can use the print function to print the results of calling the function with different strings. We can use the assert keyword to check if the function returns the expected result for each test case. By running the code, we can see that the function correctly identifies whether the input strings contain sequences of lowercase letters joined with an underscore.

# Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string. The function iterates through each character in the string to check if it is a lowercase letter or an underscore.
# Space complexity: O(1), constant space. The function does not use any additional data structures that scale with the size of the input string.
# This solution has a linear time complexity and constant space
