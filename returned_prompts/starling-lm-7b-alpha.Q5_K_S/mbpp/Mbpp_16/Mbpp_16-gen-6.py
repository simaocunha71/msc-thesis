```python
def text_lowercase_underscore(s):
    # Split the string into words
    words = s.split('_')
    # Check if all words are lowercase
    return all(word.lower() == word for word in words)
```

Here's an example of how to use this function:

```python
print(text_lowercase_underscore("aab_cbbbc"))  # prints True
print(text_lowercase_underscore("ABC_def"))    # prints False
```

The function works by first splitting the string into a list of words at every underscore. Then, it checks if all of these words are lowercase by comparing them to their lowercase version. If they are all lowercase, the function returns True, otherwise it returns False.

This function is a good example of how to use the built-in `any()` and `all()` functions. The `any()` function returns True if any element in an iterable is True, and the `all()` function returns True if all elements in an iterable are True. In this case, we use `all()` to check if all words in the list are lowercase.
