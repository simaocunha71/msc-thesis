```
def is_Even(num):
    if num % 2 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

Explanation:

The given function checks whether the given number is even or not. If the number is divisible by 2, then it is an even number, and the function returns True. Otherwise, the function returns False, indicating that the number is not even.

The assert statement in the code is used to check the correctness of the function. It checks whether the function returns False for the input 1, which is an odd number. Since 1 is not divisible by 2, the function should indeed return False for this input, and the assert statement should not raise an exception.

Overall, the provided code defines a function to determine if a number is even or not and includes an assert statement to verify the correctness of the function.

```python
def is_Even(num):
    if num % 2 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False

assert is_Even(1) == False
```

This code will pass the assertion, as the function correctly identifies the number 1 as an odd number and returns False.

```python
def is_Even(num):
    if num % 2 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False

assert is_Even(2) == True
```

This code will also pass the assertion, as the function correctly identifies the number 2 as an even number and returns True.

In conclusion, the provided code defines a function to check if a number is even or not and includes assert statements to verify the correctness of the function for different inputs.
