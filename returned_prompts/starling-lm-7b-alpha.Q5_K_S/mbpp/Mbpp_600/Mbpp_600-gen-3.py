```
def is_Even(num):
    if num % 2 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

Explanation:
This function checks if a number is even or not. If the number is divisible by 2 with no remainder, it is even.

The function `is_Even` takes a parameter `num` which is the number to be checked. Inside the function, an `if` statement is used to check if `num` modulo 2 equals 0. If it does, the function returns `True`, indicating that the number is even. If the modulo operation does not result in 0, the function returns `False`, indicating that the number is not even.

In the provided code, the `assert` statement is used to test the function with the input `1`. Since 1 is not divisible by 2 with no remainder, the assertion is expected to fail and return `False`.

Overall, the function `is_Even` correctly checks whether a given number is even or not, and the assertion demonstrates its expected behavior.

```python
def is_Even(num):
    if num % 2 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```
