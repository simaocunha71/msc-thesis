```
def is_Even(x):
    return x % 2 == 0
```

Explanation:

This function, is_Even, takes a single argument, x, and returns True if the argument is even, and False if the argument is odd.
The function works by using the modulus operator (%), which returns the remainder of the division of x by 2.
If the remainder is 0, then x is even, and the function returns True. Otherwise, the function returns False.
The assert statement at the end of the code is a way to test the function. It checks whether the function correctly identifies the number 1 as not being even, and will raise an error if the function's return value is not False.

Here's a breakdown of the function:

- The function is_Even takes a single argument, x, which is the number we want to check.
- Inside the function, the modulus operator (%), which returns the remainder of the division of x by 2, is used to check if x is divisible by 2.
- If the remainder is 0 (i.e., x is even), the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
- The assert statement at the end of the code is used to test the function. It checks whether the function correctly identifies the number 1 as not being even, and will raise an error if the function's return value is not False.

In summary, the provided function correctly checks whether a given number is even or not, and the assert statement confirms that the function works correctly for the number 1.

Here are some additional notes:

- The modulus operator (%), also known as the remainder operator, returns the remainder of the division of the number on the left by the number on the right. For example, 8 % 2 is 0 because 8 divided by 2 is 4 with no remainder.
- The remainder operator is commonly used in programming to check if a number is even or odd. If a number is divisible by 2, then the remainder of the division by 2 is 0. Therefore, if the remainder is 0, the number is even, and if the remainder is not 0, the number is odd.
- The assert statement is a debugging tool in Python that allows us to test a condition and
