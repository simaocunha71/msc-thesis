"""
This function will return the smallest number in the list by using the built-in min() function in Python. The min() function returns the smallest item in an iterable or the smallest of two or more arguments. In this case, the function will compare all of the numbers in the given list and return the smallest one. The assert statement is used to verify that the function is correctly identifying the smallest number in the list.
