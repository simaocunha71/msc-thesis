Certainly! Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the `multiple_to_single` function works:

1. `map(str, l)` is a built-in Python function that applies the `str` function to each element in the input list `l`. In other words, it converts each integer in `l` to a string. For example, if `l = [11, 33, 50]`, then `map(str, l)` returns `["11", "33", "50"]`.

2. `"".join(...)` is another built-in Python function that concatenates all the elements in a list into a single string. The separator between the elements is an empty string by default, but it can be customized if needed. In this case, since the separator is an empty string, the function concatenates the elements without any separator. For example, if the input to `join` is `["11", "33", "50"]`, then the output is `"113350"`.

3. Finally, `int(...)` is a built-in Python function that converts a string to an integer. In this case, the input is the concatenated string from step 2 (`"113350"`), so the output is the single integer `113350`.

By combining these three built-in functions, the `multiple_to_single` function is able to join a list of multiple integers into a single integer.

Here's an example to illustrate the step-by-step explanation with a different input list:

```python
l = [22, 44, 66]

# Step 1: Convert each integer to a string
strings = map(str, l)
print(strings)  # Output: ["2
