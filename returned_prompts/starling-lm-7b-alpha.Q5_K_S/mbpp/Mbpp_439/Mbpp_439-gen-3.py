```
def multiple_to_single(nums):
    nums_str = "".join(map(str, nums))
    return int(nums_str)
```

multiple_to_single([11, 33, 50])==113350

Explanation:
In this problem, we need to join a list of multiple integers into a single integer. We can achieve this by converting each integer in the list to a string and then concatenating them together. Finally, we convert the concatenated string back to an integer. Here's an example implementation:

```python
def multiple_to_single(nums):
    nums_str = "".join(map(str, nums))
    return int(nums_str)
```

To test the function, we can use the provided assert statement:

```python
assert multiple_to_single([11, 33, 50])==113350
```

This assert statement checks if the function correctly joins the list of integers [11, 33, 50] into a single integer 113350. If the function is implemented correctly, the assert statement will pass and the program will continue running without any errors.

Overall, this solution effectively joins a list of multiple integers into a single integer by converting them to a string and then back to an integer.
