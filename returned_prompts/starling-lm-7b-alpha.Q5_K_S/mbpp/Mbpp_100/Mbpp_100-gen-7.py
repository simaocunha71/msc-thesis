        num_str = str(num)
        return num_str == num_str[::-1]

This function first defines a helper function `is_palindrome(num)` to check if a number is a palindrome by converting the number to a string and comparing it with its reverse. The main function `next_smallest_palindrome(n)` continuously increments the input integer `n` until a palindrome is found, and then returns that palindrome.

To test this function, you can use the following code:
```python
def test_next_smallest_palindrome():
    assert next_smallest_palindrome(99) == 101
    print("All tests passed.")

test_next_smallest_palindrome()
```
This test case will pass if the function correctly identifies the next smallest palindrome as 101 when given the input 99.

In general, this function can be used to find the next smallest palindrome of any specified integer. However, please note that the function may not be efficient for very large inputs, as it may require significant time to find the next smallest palindrome.

As an additional note, it is worth mentioning that there are alternative approaches to finding the next smallest palindrome, such as using a set to store all the palindromes less than the input number and incrementing the input until a number not in the set is found. This approach may be more efficient for large inputs.

For example, here is an alternative implementation using sets:
```python
def next_smallest_palindrome(n):
    def is_palindrome(num):
        num_str = str(num)
        return num_str == num_str[::-1]

    palindromes = set(i for i in range(1, n) if is_palindrome(i))

    while True:
        if n + 1 in palind
