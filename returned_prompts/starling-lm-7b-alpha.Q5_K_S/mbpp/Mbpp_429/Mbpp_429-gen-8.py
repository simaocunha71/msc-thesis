"""
To solve this problem, we can create a function called and_tuples that takes two tuples as input. Inside the function, we can initialize an empty list called result. Then, we can iterate through each element in the first tuple using the enumerate function and the range function to get the index of each element. Inside the loop, we can check if the current element and the corresponding element in the second tuple are both True (non-zero). If they are, we can append the index to the result list. Finally, we can return the result list.

# Explanation:
# The and_tuples function takes two tuples, t1 and t2, as input. It initializes an empty list called result. Then, it iterates through each element in t1 using the enumerate function and the range function to get the index of each element. Inside the loop, it checks if the current element in t1 and the corresponding element in t2 are both True (non-zero). If they are, it appends the index to the result list. Finally, it returns the result list.

# In the given example, the function is called with the tuples (10, 4, 6, 9) and (5, 2, 3, 3). The function compares each element in the tuples and appends the indices of the elements where both elements are True to the result list. The result list is then printed, which is (0, 0, 2, 1). This means that the element at index 0 in the first tuple and the corresponding element in the second tuple are both True, as well as the element at index 0 in the second tuple, the element at index 2 in the first tuple, and the corresponding element in the second tuple, and the element at index 1 in the second tuple and the corresponding element in the
