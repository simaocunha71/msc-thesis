def and_tuples(tup1, tup2):
    tup1_list = list(tup1)
    tup2_list = list(tup2)
    result = []
    for i in range(len(tup1_list)):
        result.append(tup1_list[i] & tup2_list[i])
    return tuple(result)
```

Explanation:
The function `and_tuples` takes two tuples as input and converts them into lists. It then initializes an empty list `result` to store the result. Next, it iterates through the indices of the lists using a `for` loop and applies the `&` operator to the corresponding elements of `tup1` and `tup2`. The result is appended to the `result` list. Finally, the function returns the `result` list as a tuple.

The provided assertion `assert and_tuples((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (0, 0, 2, 1)` checks if the function correctly computes the elementwise `&` operation on the given tuples `(10, 4, 6, 9)` and `(5, 2, 3, 3)`, and returns the expected result `(0, 0, 2, 1)`.

This function can be used to extract the elementwise and tuples from two input tuples, and the result will be a tuple containing the bitwise AND of each corresponding element from the input tuples.

Note: It's important to ensure that the lengths of the input tuples are the same, otherwise, the function will raise an `IndexError`.

Here are some examples of usage:
```python
print(and_tuples((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)))  # Output: (0, 0, 2, 1)
print(and_tuples((10, 4, 6, 9, 8), (5, 2, 3, 3, 7)))  # Output: (0, 0,
