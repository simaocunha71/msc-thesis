    return result
```

Explanation:
To solve this problem, we can define a function called `and_tuples` that takes two tuples as input and returns a new tuple containing the elementwise and values. 

Inside the function, we initialize an empty list called `result` to store the and values. We then use a for loop to iterate over the indices of the tuples. 

For each index, we use the `&` operator to perform the bitwise AND operation between the corresponding elements of the two tuples, and append the result to the `result` list. 

Finally, we return the `result` list, which contains the elementwise and values of the two input tuples.

The provided assert statement checks if the `and_tuples` function correctly calculates the elementwise and of the given tuples `(10, 4, 6, 9)` and `(5, 2, 3, 3)`. The expected result is `(0, 0, 2, 1)`, as `10 & 5 = 0`, `4 & 2 = 0`, `6 & 3 = 2`, and `9 & 3 = 1`. 

By running the `and_tuples` function with the given tuples as arguments, we can verify that the function returns the correct result.

Overall, this solution uses a simple approach of iterating over the indices of the tuples and performing the bitwise AND operation between the corresponding elements, and then returns the result as a new tuple.

Note: The `&` operator is used for bitwise AND operation in Python, which is suitable for this problem as it extracts the common elements between the two tuples.

def and_tuples(tup1, tup2):
    result = []
