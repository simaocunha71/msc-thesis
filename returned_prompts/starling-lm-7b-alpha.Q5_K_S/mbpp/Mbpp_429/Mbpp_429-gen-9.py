Explanation:
In the question, the requirement is to write a function to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples. First of all, we can convert the two tuples into lists, and then use the zip function to combine the two lists. The zip function returns an iterator of tuples, where the i-th tuple contains the i-th element from each of the argument sequences or iterables. Then we convert the tuple to a list, and iterate over the list to get the elementwise & operation result. Finally, we convert the result list back to a tuple and return it.

In the provided code, we define a function and_tuples that takes two tuple parameters t1 and t2. We convert t1 and t2 to lists using the list function, and then use the zip function to combine the two lists, and convert the result back to a list. We then initialize an empty result list. Next, we iterate over the zipped list using a for loop, and for each tuple in the zipped list, we perform the & operation on the first element and the second element, and append the result to the result list. Finally, we convert the result list back to a tuple and return it.

The provided code also includes an assert statement to test the function and_tuples. The assert statement checks if the result of and_tuples((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) is equal to (0, 0, 2, 1). If the result is correct, the assert statement will not raise an exception.

Overall, this code defines a function to extract the elementwise and tuples from two given tuples, and tests the function with an example to
