```
def power(a, b):
    return a ** b
```

Explanation:

The function power(a, b) takes two parameters, 'a' and 'b'. It uses the exponentiation operator (**), which raises the value of 'a' to the power of 'b'. The function then returns the result of this calculation.

In the provided example, power(3,4), the function is called with 'a' equal to 3 and 'b' equal to 4. The function calculates 3 raised to the power of 4, which is 81. The assertion in the code verifies that the result of calling power(3,4) is indeed 81. 

To use the function, you can call it with different values of 'a' and 'b' to calculate their power. For example, power(2, 3) would return 8, as 2 raised to the power of 3 is 8. 

Overall, the function power(a, b) provides a simple and efficient way to calculate the value of 'a' to the power 'b' in Python.
