"""
The above assert is not valid as the power function should return 81 for the given parameters.
To calculate the value of 'a' to the power 'b' we can use the following function:

def power(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return a * power(a, b-1)

This function uses recursion to calculate the power of the value 'a' by repeatedly multiplying the value 'a' with itself.

def power(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return a * power(a, b-1)

# Test the function
assert power(3,4) == 81



# The above function is correct and will return the correct value for the given parameters.
# However, it's worth noting that a more efficient approach to calculate powers is to use the built-in pow() function in Python, as it is implemented in C and is much faster than a recursive function.

# Here's an example of how to use the pow() function:

def power(a, b):
    return pow(a, b)

# Test the function
assert power(3,4) == 81



# In conclusion, the original function can be used to calculate the power of a value, but it's worth noting that the pow() function is a more efficient and built-in approach to calculate powers in Python.
