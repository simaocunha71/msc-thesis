```python
def find(num1,num2):
    if num1 < num2:
        return 0
    else:
        return int(num1/num2)
```

Explanation:
This function checks if the first number is less than the second number. If it is, it returns 0, indicating that it is not possible to divide the first number by the second number. Otherwise, it uses the `int` function to convert the quotient to an integer (rounded down), and returns the result.

Here is an example of how you can use this function:

```python
print(find(10, 3))  # Output: 3
print(find(5, 10))  # Output: 0
```

In the first example, the function correctly calculates the quotient of 10 and 3 as 3. In the second example, since 5 is less than 10, the function returns 0.

This function correctly calculates the quotient of two numbers, rounded down to the nearest integer.

Note: It's important to note that the `find` function does not handle negative numbers. If you need to handle negative numbers, you can modify the function to check if both numbers are negative, and return 0 in that case as well.
