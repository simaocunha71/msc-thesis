"""
Explanation:
The function find(a,b) takes two parameters, a and b. It returns the quotient of a and b rounded down to the nearest integer using the int() function. The assert statement checks if the function returns the expected result for the example input of 10 and 3, which should be 3.

In the provided test case, find(10,3) is called and the result is printed, which should be 3.

# Python Program to Find Quotient of Two Numbers (Rounded Down)

def find(a, b):
    return int(a/b)

# Test Case
print(find(10,3)) #3
```

Explanation:

The function `find(a,b)` takes two parameters, `a` and `b`. It returns the quotient of `a` and `b` rounded down to the nearest integer using the `int()` function. The `assert` statement checks if the function returns the expected result for the example input of `10` and `3`, which should be `3`.

In the provided test case, `find(10,3)` is called and the result is printed, which should be `3`.
