```
def _sum(arr):
    # Initialize sum
    total = 0
    # Iterate over the array
    for i in arr:
        total += i
    return total
```

Explanation:
This function `_sum` takes an array as an argument and initializes the total variable to zero. It then iterates over the array, adding each element to the total. Finally, it returns the total sum of the array. The assert statement is used to verify that the function works correctly by checking if the sum of the array `[1, 2, 3]` is equal to six.

To use this function, you can simply call it with your desired array as an argument. For example, to find the sum of the array `[1, 2, 3]`, you would call `_sum([1, 2, 3])`. The function will then return the sum, which in this case would be six.

It's important to note that this solution assumes the input array is a list of numbers. If you want to find the sum of an array of arbitrary objects, you would need to modify the function to handle that specific case.

Overall, this solution provides a straightforward way to find the sum of an array in Python using a simple for loop and basic arithmetic operations.

Note: In Python, you can use the built-in `sum` function to find the sum of an iterable without having to write your own function. Here's an example of how to use it:
```python
arr = [1, 2, 3]
total = sum(arr)
print(total)  # Output: 6
```

This approach is generally preferred over writing your own sum function, as it is more concise and efficient.

However, if you want to understand the underlying logic of finding the sum of an array or if you prefer to implement it manually, you can use the provided solution.

ans: True

Explanation:
This function `_sum` takes an array `arr` as an argument and initializes a variable `total` to zero. Then, it iterates over each element `i` in the array and adds it to the `total`. Finally, it returns the total sum of the array.

To test the function, an
