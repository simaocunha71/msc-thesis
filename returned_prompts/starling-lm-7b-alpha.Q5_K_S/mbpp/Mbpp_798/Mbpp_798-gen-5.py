```
def _sum(numbers):
    return sum(numbers)
```

Explanation:

The `_sum` function takes in an array of numbers as an argument. It uses the built-in Python `sum` function to calculate the sum of all the numbers in the array. The `sum` function adds up all the numbers in an iterable (like a list or a tuple) and returns the total sum. In this case, the `_sum` function simply returns the result of the `sum` function applied to the input array.

To use this function, you can call it with an array of numbers as an argument, like `_sum([1, 2, 3])`. The function will then calculate the sum of the numbers in the array (in this case, 6) and return it.

The `assert` statement is a debugging tool in Python that is used to check if a certain condition is true. In this case, the `assert` statement is used to verify that the `_sum` function correctly calculates the sum of the numbers in the array. If the condition in the `assert` statement is not true (i.e., if the sum of the numbers in the array is not equal to 6), an error will be raised, indicating that there is a bug in the `_sum` function.

Overall, this code defines a Python function that calculates the sum of an array of numbers and provides a way to test if the function is working correctly using an `assert` statement.

Here are some additional notes:

- The underscore (`_`) at the beginning of the function name is a common convention in Python to indicate that the function is intended for internal use within the module and should not be directly accessed by other parts of the program.
- The `sum` function in Python is a built-in function that takes an iterable (like a list, tuple, or range object) as an argument and returns the sum of all the numbers in the iterable. It is a convenient and efficient way to calculate the sum of a collection of numbers.
- The `assert` statement in Python is a debugging tool that is used to check if a certain condition is true. If the condition is not true, an error is raised, indicating that there is a bug in the code. The `assert` statement can be useful for catching errors
