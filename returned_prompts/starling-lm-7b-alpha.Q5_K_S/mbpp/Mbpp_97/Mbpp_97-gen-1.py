"""
The problem is asking to find the frequency of each element in a flattened list of lists. A dictionary is used to store each element as the key and the frequency as the value. The function iterates through each list in the input list and for each element, it checks if the element is already in the dictionary. If it is, it increments the frequency by 1. If it is not, it adds the element to the dictionary with a frequency of 1. The function returns the dictionary.

To test the function, a test case is provided. The function is called with a list of lists as an argument and the expected output is {1: 1, 2: 3, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 2, 6: 1, 7: 1, 8: 1, 9: 1}. The function returns the correct output and the test passes.
