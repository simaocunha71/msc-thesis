"""
Explanation:
The function takes a flattened list of lists as an argument, and initializes an empty dictionary. 
It then loops through each item in the list of lists, and for each item, it loops through each element of the item. 
For each element, it checks if the element is already in the dictionary. If it is, it increments the value of the element in the dictionary by 1. If it isn't, it adds the element to the dictionary with a value of 1. 
Finally, it returns the dictionary with the frequency of each element in the flattened list of lists.
