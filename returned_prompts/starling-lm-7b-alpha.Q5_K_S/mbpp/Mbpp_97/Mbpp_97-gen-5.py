"""
The problem is asking us to return a dictionary with the elements of the flattened list as keys and their frequencies as values. The first step is to initialize an empty dictionary called `output_dict` to store the results. Then, we'll iterate over each sublist in the input list of lists. For each sublist, we'll iterate over each element, adding it to our `output_dict` if it's not already there. If the element is already in the dictionary, we'll increment its frequency by 1. Once we've gone through all the sublists and elements, we'll return the dictionary.
"""

"""
To test the function, we can use the `assert` statement to check if the output of the function on a given input matches the expected output. In this case, we can compare the result of `frequency_lists([[1, 2, 3, 2], [4, 5, 6, 2], [7, 8, 9, 5]])` with the expected output `{1: 1, 2: 3, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 2, 6: 1, 7: 1, 8: 1, 9: 1}`. If the two outputs match, the assertion passes, and the function is correct. Otherwise, the assertion fails, indicating an error in the function.
"""

"""
The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the total number of elements in the input list of lists. This is because we only need to iterate over the list once to calculate the frequencies. The space complexity is also O(n), as we're storing the frequencies in a dictionary, which can have at most n elements.

In terms of readability, this function is quite clear and easy to understand. The code is well-structured, with
