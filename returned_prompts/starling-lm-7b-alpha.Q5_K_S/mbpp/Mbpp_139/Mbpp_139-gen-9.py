Here's a Python function to calculate the circumference of a circle:

```python
import math

def circle_circumference(radius):
    """
    Calculate the circumference of a circle.

    Args:
        radius (float): The radius of the circle.

    Returns:
        float: The circumference of the circle.
    """
    return 2 * math.pi * radius
```

To test the function, you can use the `math.isclose()` function to compare the calculated circumference with the expected value within a certain tolerance. Here's an example:

```python
import math

def test_circle_circumference():
    assert math.isclose(circle_circumference(10), 62.830000000000005, rel_tol=0.001)
```

The `math.isclose()` function returns `True` if the absolute difference between the actual and expected values is less than the specified relative tolerance. In this case, the relative tolerance is set to `0.001`, which means the actual and expected values should be close to each other within `0.001` of their magnitude.

Note that the relative tolerance is used to account for potential rounding errors in the calculation of the circumference. It's important to choose an appropriate tolerance based on the desired level of accuracy.
