Here's a step-by-step walkthrough of the solution:

1. First, we need to import the `math` module, which contains various mathematical functions and constants.

2. Next, we define a function called `circle_circumference` that takes the radius of the circle as a parameter.

3. Inside the function, we use the formula for the circumference of a circle, which is `2 * pi * radius`. We store the result in a variable called `circumference`.

4. Finally, we use the `print` function to print the value of `circumference`.

To test the function, we can use the `assert` statement along with the `math.isclose` function to check if the calculated circumference is approximately equal to the expected value, with a relative tolerance of 0.001.

Here's an example of how to use the function:
```python
import math

def circle_circumference(radius):
    circumference = 2 * math.pi * radius
    print(circumference)

assert math.isclose(circle_circumference(10), 62.830000000000005, rel_tol=0.001)
```
When you run this code, it will print the circumference of the circle with the given radius and the `assert` statement will check if the calculated circumference is within the specified relative tolerance.

Note: The `math.isclose` function is used to compare two floating-point numbers and check if they are approximately equal, taking into account the relative tolerance.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.

```python
import math

def circle_circumference(radius):
    circumference = 2 * math.pi * radius
    print(circumference)

assert math.isclose(circle_circumference(10), 62.830000000000005, rel_tol=0.001)
```
This code defines a function `circle_circumference` that takes the radius of a circle as an input. It calculates the circumference of the circle using the formula `2 * pi *
