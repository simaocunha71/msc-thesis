"""
Here's a Python function to calculate the circumference of a circle, given the radius. It uses the math module to calculate the value of pi:

```python
import math

def circle_circumference(radius):
    """Calculate the circumference of a circle"""
    return 2 * math.pi * radius
```

The function uses the formula for the circumference of a circle, which is 2 * pi * r, where r is the radius. The function returns the calculated circumference as a float value.

To verify the function, you can use the `math.isclose()` function from the math module to check if the calculated circumference is approximately equal to the expected value (62.830000000000005) within a relative tolerance of 0.001. The `math.isclose()` function compares two numbers and returns True if they are approximately equal within the specified relative tolerance.

Here's an example of how you can use the function and the `math.isclose()` function to verify the result:

```python
assert math.isclose(circle_circumference(10), 62.830000000000005, rel_tol=0.001)
```

In this example, the `circle_circumference()` function is called with a radius of 10, and the result is compared to the expected value (62.830000000000005) within a relative tolerance of 0.001 using the `math.isclose()` function. The `assert` statement checks if the comparison is True, and if it is not, an AssertionError is raised.

By using the `math.isclose()` function, you can ensure that the calculated circumference is within the specified relative tolerance, providing a level of accuracy and precision to your calculations.
