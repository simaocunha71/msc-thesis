"""
To find the circumference of a circle, the formula is 2*pi*r, where r is the radius of the circle. Here's a function that implements this formula:

```python
import math

def circle_circumference(r):
    return 2 * math.pi * r
```

To test this function, we can use the `math.isclose` function, which checks if two numbers are approximately equal within a given tolerance. In this case, we're comparing the result of `circle_circumference(10)` to the expected value of `62.830000000000005`. The `rel_tol` parameter specifies the relative tolerance, which means that the two numbers are considered approximately equal if their absolute difference divided by the value of the second number is less than the tolerance:

```python
assert math.isclose(circle_circumference(10), 62.830000000000005, rel_tol=0.001)
```

This assertion will pass if the two numbers are approximately equal within the specified tolerance.

assert math.isclose(circle_circumference(10), 62.830000000000005, rel_tol=0.001)



```
In this function, we first import the `math` module to access the value of pi. Then, we define the function `circle_circumference` that takes the radius `r` as a parameter. Inside the function, we calculate the circumference of the circle using the formula 2*pi*r. Finally, we use the `math.isclose` function to check if the result of `circle_circumference(10)` is approximately equal to the expected value of `62.830000000000005` within a relative tolerance of `0.001`. The `math.isclose` function returns `True` if the two numbers are approximately equal, and `False` otherwise.
