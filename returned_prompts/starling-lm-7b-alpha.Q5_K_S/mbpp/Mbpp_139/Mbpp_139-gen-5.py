"""
The radius of the circle is given as 10. The circumference of a circle can be calculated using the formula C = 2 * pi * r. Here, the value of pi is approximately 3.14159265358979323846. Substituting these values in the formula, we get C = 2 * 3.14159265358979323846 * 10 = 62.831853071795864769. The function circle_circumference(radius) can be defined as follows:

def circle_circumference(radius):
    """Calculate the circumference of a circle."""
    return 2 * 3.14159265358979323846 * radius

"""

def circle_circumference(radius):
    """Calculate the circumference of a circle."""
    return 2 * 3.14159265358979323846 * radius

To test the function, you can use the following code:

import math

assert math.isclose(circle_circumference(10), 62.830000000000005, rel_tol=0.001)

The assert statement checks if the result of the circle_circumference function with the radius of 10 is approximately equal to 62.830000000000005, within a relative tolerance of 0.001. The math.isclose function is used to compare the two values and determine if they are close within the specified tolerance.
