def circle_circumference(radius):
    return 2 * math.pi * radius
```

Explanation:
To find the circumference of a circle, you multiply the radius of the circle by 2Ï€ (pi). The function circle_circumference takes the radius of the circle as input and returns the circumference of the circle. In the provided assert statement, the function is tested with a radius of 10 and the result is compared to the expected value of 62.83 using the math.isclose() function, which checks if two numbers are approximately equal within a relative tolerance of 0.001.

In the provided solution, the math.pi constant is used to represent the value of pi (approximately 3.14159). The function circle_circumference multiplies the radius by 2 and then by math.pi to calculate the circumference of the circle. The result is then returned by the function.

To test the function, you can call it with a radius value and compare the result to the expected value using assertions. For example, the assert statement in the provided code asserts that the result of circle_circumference(10) is approximately equal to 62.83 with a relative tolerance of 0.001.

Overall, the provided solution defines a function to calculate the circumference of a circle and demonstrates how to test it using assertions.

Here are the steps to run the code:

1. Import the math module to access the math.pi constant and the math.isclose() function.
2. Define the circle_circumference function that takes a radius as input and returns the circumference of the circle.
3. Call the circle_circumference function with a radius value (e.g., 10) and store the result in a variable.
4. Use the assert statement to check if the result of circle_circumference(10) is approximately equal to 62.83 with a relative tolerance of 0.001.
5. Run the code to execute the assertion and see if the result matches the expected value.

By following these steps, you can test the function and verify if it correctly calculates the circumference of a circle.
