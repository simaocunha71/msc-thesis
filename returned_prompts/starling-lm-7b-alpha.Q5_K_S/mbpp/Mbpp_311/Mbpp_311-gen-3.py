# This function takes a number as input and returns the number with its left most unset bit set. It uses the bitwise OR operator (|) to set the left most unset bit. 

# The bitwise OR operator (|) sets the corresponding bit of the result to 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits in the operands is 1. 

# The expression `n + 1` is used to find the left most unset bit of the number `n`. The left most unset bit of a number is the first bit from the right that is 0. 

# The bitwise OR operation between `n` and `n + 1` will set the left most unset bit of `n` to 1. 

# The function returns the result of the bitwise OR operation, which is the original number with its left most unset bit set. 

# The assert statement is used to verify the correctness of the function. It asserts that the function correctly sets the left most unset bit of the number 10 to 14.

# The time complexity of this function is O(1) because it performs a constant number of bitwise OR operations regardless of the size of the input number. 

# The space complexity is also O(1) because it uses a constant amount of space to store the result.

# Overall, this function is an efficient and correct solution to the problem of setting the left most unset bit of a number in Python.
"""

# Here's an example usage of the function:

def set_left_most_unset_bit(n):
    return n | (n + 1)

print(set_left_most_unset_bit(10))  # Output: 14

# The function call `set_left_most_unset_bit(10)` returns 14, which is the number 10 with its left most unset bit set to 1. 

# This demonstrates the correctness of the function and its ability to set the left most unset bit of a number in Python.

# This function can be used in any Python program that requires setting the left most unset bit
