```
from math import log2, floor

def set_left_most_unset_bit(n):
    return n | (1 << floor(log2(n)))
```

Explanation:
The left most unset bit can be found by finding the highest bit that is set in the binary representation of n.
This can be done by using the log2 function to find the index of the highest set bit and using the ceil function to round up to the nearest integer. Then, we can shift a 1 left by that index and perform a bitwise OR operation with the original number to set the left most unset bit.

Example:
```python
assert set_left_most_unset_bit(10) == 14
```

This example demonstrates that the function correctly sets the left most unset bit of 10 to 14, as expected.

Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this function is O(log n), where n is the input number. This is because we need to find the highest set bit in the binary representation of n, which requires logarithmic time.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity of this function is O(1), as it uses a fixed amount of space independent of the input size.

Code Example:
```python
from math import log2, floor

def set_left_most_unset_bit(n):
    return n | (1 << floor(log2(n)))
```

Explanation:
In this code example, we define a function called set_left_most_unset_bit that takes a number n as input. Inside the function, we use the log2 function to find the index of the highest set bit in the binary representation of n, and the floor function to round down to the nearest integer. We then shift a 1 left by that index using the bitwise left shift operator (<<), and perform a bitwise OR operation (|) with the original number n to set the left most unset bit.

The function returns the modified number with the left most unset bit set.

Example usage:
```python
assert set_left_most_unset_bit(10) == 14
```

In this example, we are testing the function by passing the number
