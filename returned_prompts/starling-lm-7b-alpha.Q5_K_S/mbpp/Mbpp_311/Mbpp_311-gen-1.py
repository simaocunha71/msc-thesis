def set_left_most_unset_bit(n):
    return n | (n + 1)
```

Explanation:
To set the left most unset bit we can find the right most set bit using the formula `rightmost_set_bit_index(n) = log2(n & -n)` and then shift the bit to the left by adding 2 to the power of the right most set bit index. 

The formula `log2(n & -n)` gives us the index of the right most set bit. 

The `n & -n` part of the formula performs a bitwise AND operation between `n` and the one's complement of `n`. The one's complement of a number is the result of flipping all the bits of the number. 

For example, if `n` is `1101` then `n & -n` is `1010` because only the right most set bit is left after the bitwise AND operation. 

Then, we can use the formula `2^rightmost_set_bit_index` to shift the bit to the left and set it. 

For example, if `rightmost_set_bit_index` is `2` then `2^2` is `4` which is added to `n` to set the left most unset bit. 

The `n | (n + 1)` part of the formula performs a bitwise OR operation between `n` and `n + 1` which sets the left most unset bit.

For example, if `n` is `10` then `n | (n + 1)` is `14` because the left most unset bit of `10` is set to `1` in `14`. 

So, the `set_left_most_unset_bit(n)` function returns the value of `n | (n + 1)` which sets the left most unset bit of the input number `n`.

The assert statement `assert set_left_most_unset_bit(10) == 14` checks if the function correctly sets the left most unset bit by comparing the result of the function with the expected result of `14`.

The function is correct
