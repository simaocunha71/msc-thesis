def set_left_most_unset_bit(n):
    return (n | (n + 1))
"""

Explanation:
The left most unset bit can be found using the formula (n | (n + 1)).

Here, | is the bitwise OR operator.

For example, when n = 10, then (n | (n + 1)) = (10 | (10 + 1)) = (10 | 11) = 14.

Here, 10 in binary is 1010 and 11 in binary is 1011. Performing a bitwise OR on these two numbers gives us 1010 | 1011 = 1011 which is equal to 14 in decimal.

Hence, the left most unset bit in the number 10 is 14.

The function set_left_most_unset_bit(n) takes an integer n as an argument and returns the left most unset bit by performing the above calculation.

Here's the Python code to find the left most unset bit in a number:

```python
# Python3 program to find the left
# most unset bit in a number

# Function to find the left most
# unset bit in a number
def set_left_most_unset_bit(n):
    return (n | (n + 1))

# Driver Code
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(set_left_most_unset_bit(10))
```

When you run this program, it will print the left most unset bit of the number 10, which is 14.

To understand how this works, let's break down the code:
