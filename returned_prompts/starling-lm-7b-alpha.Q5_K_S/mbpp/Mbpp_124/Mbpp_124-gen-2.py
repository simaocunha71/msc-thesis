Here's a Python solution using the `math` library:

```python
import math

def angle_complex(x, y):
    return math.atan2(y, x)
```

The `math.atan2(y, x)` function returns the angle of the complex number `x + yi` in radians. In the `assert` statement, the `math.isclose()` function is used to check if the calculated angle is close to the expected result (`1.5707963267948966`) within a relative tolerance of `0.001`.

To use the `angle_complex()` function, you can simply pass the real and imaginary parts of the complex number as arguments. For example, `angle_complex(0,1j)` will return `1.5707963267948966`, which is the angle of the complex number `0 + 1j` in radians.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.
