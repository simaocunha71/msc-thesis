"""
Here's a function to calculate the angle of a complex number:

```python
import math

def angle_complex(real, imag):
    return math.atan2(imag, real)
```

To use this function, you can pass in the real and imaginary parts of a complex number as arguments. For example, to calculate the angle of the complex number `0 + 1j`, you would call the function like this: `angle_complex(0, 1j)`. The function will return the angle in radians.

In the provided assert statement, the expected result of `angle_complex(0, 1j)` is `1.5707963267948966`. The `math.isclose()` function is used to check if the calculated angle is close to the expected result within a relative tolerance of `0.001`. If the angle is within this tolerance, the assertion will pass, indicating that the function is working correctly.

Note that the `math.atan2()` function is used to calculate the angle, which returns the arc tangent of the quotient of the imaginary part and the real part of the complex number, in radians. The `math.isclose()` function is used to compare the calculated angle with the expected result, taking into account the relative tolerance.

# Example usage:
assert math.isclose(angle_complex(0, 1j), 1.5707963267948966, rel_tol=0.001)
