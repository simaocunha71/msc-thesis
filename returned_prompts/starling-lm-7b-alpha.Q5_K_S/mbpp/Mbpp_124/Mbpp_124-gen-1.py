The angle of a complex number is the angle that the line segment from the origin to the complex number makes with the x-axis.

To calculate the angle, we can use the arctangent (atan2) function, which returns the angle of a complex number in radians.

Here's a function that calculates the angle of a complex number:

```python
import math

def angle_complex(x, y):
    angle = math.atan2(y, x)
    return angle
```

To use this function, you can call it with the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. For example, to calculate the angle of the complex number 0 + 1j, you can call the function like this:

```python
angle = angle_complex(0, 1j)
```

The result will be the angle of the complex number in radians.

Note that the arctangent function returns angles in the range -pi to pi, so you may need to adjust the result if you need the angle in a different range.

Here's an example of how you can use the function to test the result:

```python
import math

def test_angle_complex():
    assert math.isclose(angle_complex(0,1j), 1.5707963267948966, rel_tol=0.001)

test_angle_complex()
```

This test will pass if the angle of the complex number 0 + 1j is close to 1.5707963267948966, within a relative tolerance of 0.001.

```python
def angle_complex(x, y):
    angle = math.atan2(y, x)
    return angle
```

To use the function, pass the real and imaginary parts of the complex number as arguments to the function. For example, to calculate the angle of the complex number 0 + 1j, you would call the function like this:

```python
angle = angle_complex(0, 1j)
```

The result will be the angle of the complex number in radians.
