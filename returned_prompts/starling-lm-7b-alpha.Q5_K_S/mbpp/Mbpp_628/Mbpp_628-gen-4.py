def replace_spaces(string):
    return string.replace(" ", "%20")

"""
The replace() function is a built-in function that can be used to replace all the occurrences of a substring with another substring. In this case, the 'replace()' function is used to replace all the spaces with '%20'.
"""

```python
def replace_spaces(string):
    return string.replace(" ", "%20")
```

Here, the replace_spaces function is defined to take a string as an argument and returns the string with all the spaces replaced by '%20'. The replace() function is then used to replace all the spaces with '%20'.

In the assert statement, we are checking if the function correctly replaces all the spaces with '%20' in the given string "My Name is Dawood". The assert statement will pass if the function returns the expected output 'My%20Name%20is%20Dawood'.

Finally, the print statement is used to print the result of the function when called with the input "My Name is Dawood". The output will be 'My%20Name%20is%20Dawood', which confirms that the function is working correctly.

```python
# My%20Name%20is%20Dawood
```

This is the expected output when the function is called with the input "My Name is Dawood". All the spaces in the string have been replaced with '%20'.
