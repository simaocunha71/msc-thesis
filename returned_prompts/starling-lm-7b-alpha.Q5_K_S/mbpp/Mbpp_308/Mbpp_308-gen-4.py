This function sorts the two lists in reverse order, and then selects the first `num` elements from each list. It multiplies the corresponding elements from each list and appends the result to the `products` list. Finally, it returns the `products` list, which contains the largest products of the two lists.

The time complexity of this function is O(n log n), where n is the length of the two lists. This is because sorting the two lists takes O(n log n) time, and finding the `num` largest products takes O(n) time.

The space complexity of this function is O(n), as it stores the `products` list, which has a maximum size of `num`.

You can use the `assert` statement to test the function and ensure that it returns the expected result.

Here's an example of how to use the `large_product` function:

```python
assert large_product([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],[3, 6, 8, 9, 10, 6],3)==[60, 54, 50]
```

This will check if the function correctly returns the largest products of the two lists, and if the result matches the expected result.

Note: This function assumes that the two lists have the same length, and that `num` is less than or equal to the length of the two lists. If these conditions are not met, the function may not return the correct result.

In addition, this function does not handle
