"""
In the given code, we are first sorting both the lists in reverse order using the sort() function. Then, we are selecting the first n elements from each list using list slicing. After that, we are computing the product of all the elements in each list using the reduce() function. Finally, we are returning the top n products.
"""

"""
Here are some tips for optimizing the code:

1. Instead of sorting both the lists, we can directly select the first n elements from each list using list slicing. This will reduce the time complexity of the code.

2. Instead of computing the product of all the elements in each list using the reduce() function, we can directly multiply all the elements together using a for loop. This will reduce the time complexity of the code.

3. Instead of returning the top n products, we can return a list of n tuples, where each tuple contains the product of one element from each list. This will reduce the space complexity of the code.

4. Instead of using a for loop to compute the product of all the elements in each list, we can use a generator expression to compute the product of all the elements in each list. This will reduce the space complexity of the code.
