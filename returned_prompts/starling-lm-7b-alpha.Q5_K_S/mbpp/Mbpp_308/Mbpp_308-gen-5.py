```
def large_product(lst1,lst2,num):
    lst1.sort(reverse=True)
    lst2.sort(reverse=True)
    res=[]
    for i in range(num):
        res.append(lst1[i]*lst2[i])
    return res
```

The above function is correct, and its time complexity is O(nlogn).

Here are some tips for writing more Pythonic code:

1. It is more Pythonic to use `append` to add elements to a list one at a time, rather than using `+=`.
2. When sorting a list in reverse order, using `reverse=True` is more Pythonic.
3. When the length of a list is fixed, using a range is more Pythonic than using `len()`.

Here is a more Pythonic version of the function:

```python
def large_product(lst1,lst2,num):
    lst1.sort(reverse=True)
    lst2.sort(reverse=True)
    res = []
    for i in range(num):
        res.append(lst1[i] * lst2[i])
    return res
```

This function is correct and its time complexity is O(nlogn).
