"""
This function will take a string 'sentence' and return a tuple with two elements.
The first element will be an index of the sentence, where the first adverb is found.
The second element will be the first adverb itself.
If there is no adverb in the sentence, it will return (None, None).
"""

# This function works by splitting the given sentence into a list of words.
# Then it iterates through the list of words. If a word is an adverb, it returns the index of that word and the word itself.
# If it does not find any adverbs, it returns None, None.

# To use this function, you can call it like this:
# find_adverb_position("clearly!! we can see the sky")

# It will return (0, 'clearly'), which means that the first adverb 'clearly' is at the 0th index of the sentence.

# Note that this function assumes that the adverbs are always at the beginning of the sentence. If there are adverbs at other positions, it will not find them.

# Additionally, this function only works with the predefined list of adverbs. If you want to use other adverbs, you need to add them to the 'adverbs' list.

# You can test this function by calling it with different sentences and checking if it returns the correct result.

# For example, if you call find_adverb_position("quickly run! we can jump the fence"), it will return (0, 'quickly'), because the first adverb 'quickly' is at the 0th index of the sentence.

# However, if you call find_adverb_position("we can see the sky"), it will return None, None, because there are no adverbs in the sentence.

# You can also test this function with sentences
