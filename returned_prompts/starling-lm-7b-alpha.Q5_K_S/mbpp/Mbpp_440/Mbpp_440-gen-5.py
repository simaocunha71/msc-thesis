"""
This code defines a function called find_adverb_position that takes in a sentence as a parameter. It initializes a list called adverb_list with some common adverbs. Then, it loops through the characters in the sentence using a for loop. Inside the loop, it checks if the current character is one of the adverbs in the adverb_list. If it is, it returns the index of the character in the sentence, the index of the first occurrence of the adverb in the sentence, and the adverb itself. If no adverb is found in the sentence, it returns -1. Finally, it calls the function with the sentence "clearly!! we can see the sky" and asserts that the returned value is (0, 7, 'clearly').
"""

# As a result, the function will return the index of the first adverb in the sentence, the index of the first occurrence of the adverb in the sentence, and the adverb itself.

# This function can be used to find the first adverb and its positions in a given sentence.

# Here are some additional examples of how the function can be used:

# assert find_adverb_position("She quickly left the room.") == (3, 7, 'quickly')
# assert find_adverb_position("The food tastes beautifully.") == (7, 13, 'beautifully')
# assert find_adverb_position("The cat slowly walked across the street.") == (4, 8, 'slowly')
# assert find_adverb_position("I can't see anything.") == -1

# These examples demonstrate how the function can be used to find the first adverb and its positions in a variety of sentences.

# The function can be useful in natural language processing tasks, such as analyzing sentence structure or extract
