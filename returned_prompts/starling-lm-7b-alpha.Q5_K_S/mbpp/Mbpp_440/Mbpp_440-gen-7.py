"""
This code defines a function called find_adverb_position that takes a sentence as input and returns the position of the first adverb in the sentence. The function iterates through each character in the sentence and checks if it is a space. If it is, the function then checks if the next character is also a space, and so on, until it has checked the next five characters. If all five characters are spaces, the function checks if the substring between the first and second spaces is an adverb. If it is, the function returns the positions of the adverb in the sentence. If no adverbs are found, the function returns -1.

The function can be improved by using a more efficient approach. Instead of checking
