Explanation:
In this Python function, the function find_Index is defined which takes a parameter n. The parameter n is decreased by 1 because the length of the string representation of a number is always one less than the actual number. 

A loop is set up to iterate through all numbers from 1 to 1,000,000. For each number, the length of the string representation of the number multiplied by (number + 1) divided by 2 is calculated. If the length of this string is equal to n, the function returns the index i. 

The function is called with the parameter 2 and the result is printed, which should be 4. 

The assert statement at the beginning of the code is used to check if the function is working correctly. It checks if the result of the function with the parameter 2 is equal to 4, and if it is not, an error is raised.

This code will find the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits.

In the triangular number, the sum of all the natural numbers up to a certain number is calculated. For example, the first few triangular numbers are 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, and so on. 

The smallest triangular number with n digits is the smallest number that, when its digits are concatenated together, forms an n-digit number. 

For example, the smallest triangular number with 3 digits is 105, because 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15, and 15 is a 3-digit number. 

The function find_Index calculates the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits by iterating through all numbers from 1 to 1,000,000 and checking if the length of the string representation of the number multiplied by (number + 1) divided by 2 is equal to n
