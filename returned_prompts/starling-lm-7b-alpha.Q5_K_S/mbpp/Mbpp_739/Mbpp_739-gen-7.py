"""
Explanation:
The code defines a function called `find_Index` that takes an integer `n` as input. It initializes a variable `i` with the value 1. It then enters a while loop that continues until the length of the string representation of `i*(i+1)/2` is less than `n`. In each iteration of the loop, `i` is incremented by 1. Once the loop exits, the function returns the value of `i`.

The assert statement is a way to test the correctness of a function. In this case, it asserts that when `find_Index` is called with the argument 2, it should return 4. This serves as a test case to verify that the function is working correctly.

The print statement at the end of the code calls the `find_Index` function with the argument 2 and prints the result. In this case, it will print the value of `i` when the while loop exits, which corresponds to the smallest triangular number with 2 digits.
