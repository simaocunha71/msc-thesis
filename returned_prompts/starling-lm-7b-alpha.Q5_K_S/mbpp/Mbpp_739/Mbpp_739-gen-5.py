Correct Solution:

def find_Index(n):

Explanation:
This program defines a function called find_Index that takes a single argument, n, and returns the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits. The function uses a while loop to increment the value of i until the length of the string representation of i*(i+1)/2 is equal to or greater than n. The function returns the value of i when this condition is met. The program then calls the function with the argument 2 and prints the result, which should be 4.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works:

1. The function find_Index is defined with a single parameter, n, representing the desired number of digits in the triangular number.
2. Inside the function, a variable i is initialized to 1. This variable will be used to generate triangular numbers.
3. A while loop is used to increment the value of i until the length of the string representation of i*(i+1)/2 is equal to or greater than n. This condition ensures that the triangular number generated is of the desired length.
4. Within the while loop, the length of the string representation of i*(i+1)/2 is compared to n. If the length is less than n, i is incremented by 1 and the loop continues. If the length is equal to or greater than n, the loop exits and the value of i is returned as the result of the function.
5. After the function definition, the function is called with the argument 2 and the result is printed. The expected output is 4, which is the index of the smallest triangular number with 2 digits.

The output of the program will be:
4

This means that the smallest triangular number with 2 digits is the triangular number corresponding to the index 4, which
