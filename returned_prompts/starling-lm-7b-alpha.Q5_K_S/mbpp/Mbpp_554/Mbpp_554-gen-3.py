def Split(nums):
    return [i for i in nums if i % 2 == 1]
```

This function defines a list comprehension that goes through each integer in the input list and checks if it's odd (i.e. the remainder of the integer divided by two is one). If the condition is true, the integer is added to the new list. The function then returns the new list containing only odd integers.

To test the function, you can use the `assert` statement to verify if the function is returning the correct result. In this case, the `Split` function is tested with the list `[1,2,3,4,5,6]`, and the expected result is `[1,3,5]`. If the actual result matches the expected result, the `assert` statement will not raise an error and the test will pass.

Note: The `assert` statement is used for debugging purposes and is not meant to be used in production code. It raises an `AssertionError` if the condition is not met, and can be useful for catching errors early in the development process.

In summary, the provided function `Split` takes a list of integers and returns a new list containing only the odd integers. The function is tested using the `assert` statement, and the expected result is `[1,3,5]` for the input `[1,2,3,4,5,6]`.
