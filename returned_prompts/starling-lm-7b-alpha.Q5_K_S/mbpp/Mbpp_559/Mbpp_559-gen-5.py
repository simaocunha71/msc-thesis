"""
This function first defines a max_sum variable and sets it to 0. It then uses two nested for loops to iterate over all possible sublists of the given list, with the outer loop iterating over the starting index of the sublist and the inner loop iterating over the ending index. For each sublist, it checks whether the sum of the numbers in the sublist is greater than or equal to the target sum s and whether it is greater than the current max_sum. If both of these conditions are true, it updates the max_sum variable. Finally, it returns the max_sum, which represents the sum of the largest contiguous sublist in the given list that has a sum greater than or equal to the target sum.

The assert statement checks whether the function correctly calculates the max_sum for the given input list and target sum, and asserts that the result is equal to the expected value of 7.

"""
The time complexity of this function is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input list. This is because the function uses two nested for loops that iterate over all possible sublists of the given list. The space complexity of the function is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of additional memory to store the max_sum variable.
"""

"""
To optimize the function, we can use Kadane's algorithm, which has a linear time complexity of O(n). This algorithm maintains a running sum of the sublist and keeps track of the maximum sum found so far. It also keeps track of the maximum sum ending at the current index. By iterating through the input list and updating these variables
