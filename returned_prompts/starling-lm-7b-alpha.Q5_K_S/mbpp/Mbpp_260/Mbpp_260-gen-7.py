"""
The Newman–Shanks–Williams method is an algorithm for finding prime numbers, specifically for finding the nth prime number. The algorithm is based on the Fermat pseudoprime, and it was developed by Newman, Shanks, and Williams.

To implement the algorithm in Python, you can use the following function:

def newman_prime(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 2
    elif n == 2:
        return 3
    elif n == 3:
        return 5
    elif n == 4:
        return 7
    else:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            return newman_prime(n - 1)
        else:
            a = 2
            while True:
                b = pow(a, (1 << (n - 3)), 1 << (n - 1))
                if b == 1:
                    return newman_prime(n - 1)
                a += 1

In the function, the base cases are defined for the first four prime numbers (2, 3, 5, and 7), and then the algorithm is applied recursively for the remaining cases. The algorithm uses the Fermat pseudoprime test to check if a number is prime.

To verify the correctness of the function, you can use the assert statement to check if the function returns the expected result for the first few prime numbers:

assert newman_prime(3) == 7

        return 2

        return 3
    elif n == 3:
        return 5
    elif n == 4:
        return 7
    else:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            return newman_prime(n - 1)
        else:
            a = 2
            while True:
                b = pow(a, (1 << (n - 3)), 1 << (n - 1))
                if b == 1:
                    return newman_prime(n - 1)
                a += 1
