This function finds the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number by using the properties of the newman–shanks–williams algorithm. The algorithm starts with a and b as the first two prime numbers (2 and 3). Then, in each iteration, a is updated to the square of b modulo n, and b is updated to the next number. The loop continues until n becomes 1, at which point the function returns the current value of b. The function handles the cases where n is 0 or 1 separately, as these are the only two prime numbers.

To verify the function, you can use the assert statement to check if the function returns the correct value for the 3rd newman–shanks–williams prime number (which is 7). If the function is implemented correctly, the assert statement should not raise an error.

Here's an example of how you can use the function and assert the result:
```python
assert newman_prime(3) == 7
```
If the function is implemented correctly, this assert statement should not raise an error.

Note: The newman–shanks–williams algorithm is a method for finding prime numbers, but it does not guarantee that every output will be a prime number. The algorithm can produce composite numbers as well. It is important to be cautious when using this algorithm and to verify the output with other methods if necessary.
