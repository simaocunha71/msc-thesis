def newman_prime(n):
    """
    Find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        The nth newman–shanks–williams prime to find.

    Returns
    -------
    int
        The nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.

    Notes
    -----
    The newman–shanks–williams algorithm is an efficient method of finding
    the nth prime number. It is based on the following recurrence relation:

    u(n+1) = u(n+1) + u(n) ** 2 + 1
    u(1) = 2

    where u(n) is the nth newman–shanks–williams number. The first few
    newman–shanks–williams numbers are 2, 5, 29, 871, 40893, ...

    The nth prime number is then given by the index of the first newman–
    shanks–williams number that is a prime number. That is, the nth prime
    number is the smallest value of k such that u(k) is a prime number.

    The newman–shanks–williams algorithm is particularly efficient because
    it only requires the ability to multiply and add together large integers
    (with no need for exponentiation or square roots).
