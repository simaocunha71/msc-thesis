"""
The above code defines a function called new_tuple that takes a list and a string as input and returns a tuple. 
The function concatenates the list and the string using the split method to separate the string into a list of words. 
Then, it concatenates the two lists and converts them into a tuple using the tuple function.
"""

# To use the function, you can simply call it with the desired list and string arguments, like in the example.



"""
In the example, the function is called with the arguments ["WEB", "is"] and "best". 
The function concatenates the list and the string, resulting in the tuple ('WEB', 'is', 'best'). 
The assert statement is used to verify that the function produces the expected output.
"""

"""
Overall, the new_tuple function is a convenient way to create a new tuple from a given string and list, by combining the two collections into a single tuple.
"""

"""
The time complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the total number of elements in the list and the string.
This is because the split method is used to separate the string into a list of words, which has a time complexity of O(n).
The concatenation of the two lists and the conversion into a tuple both have a time complexity of O(1), as they only involve a single operation.
Therefore, the overall time complexity of the function is determined by the split method, which is O(n).
"""

"""
The space complexity of the function is O(1), as it only uses a single tuple to store the result.
There are no additional data structures created, and the space usage is constant regardless of the input size.
"""

"""
In summary, the new_tuple function is an efficient way to create a new tuple from a given string and list.
It has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1).
