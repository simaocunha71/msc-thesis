```python
def max_difference(tuples):
    """
    Find the maximum difference between available pairs in the given tuple list.
    """
    # Initialize max_difference
    max_difference = 0
    # Iterate through the tuple list
    for t in tuples:
        # Extract the first and second elements of the tuple
        a, b = t
        # Calculate the difference
        diff = b - a
        # Check if this difference is greater than max_difference
        if diff > max_difference:
            max_difference = diff
    # Return the maximum difference
    return max_difference
```

To use this function, you can call it with a tuple list as an argument:

```python
print(max_difference([(3, 5), (1, 7), (10, 3), (1, 2)]))  # Output: 7
```

This will return the maximum difference between available pairs in the given tuple list, which is 7 in this case.

The function works by iterating through each tuple in the given list, extracting the first and second elements, and calculating the difference. It then compares this difference with the current maximum difference and updates the maximum difference if necessary. Finally, it returns the maximum difference found.

In the provided example, the maximum difference between available pairs in the tuple list `[(3, 5), (1, 7), (10, 3), (1, 2)]` is 7, as the pair (7, 1) has the largest difference of 7.

You can test this function with different tuple lists to find the maximum difference between available pairs in those lists.
