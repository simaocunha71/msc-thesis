Here is one possible solution:

```
def max_difference(tuples):
    max_diff = 0
    for t in tuples:
        a = t[0]
        b = t[1]
        diff = max(a, b) - min(a, b)
        max_diff = max(max_diff, diff)
    return max_diff
```

Explanation:

1. Initialize max_diff as 0 to store the maximum difference between available pairs in the tuple list.
2. Iterate through all tuples in the tuple list.
3. For each tuple, extract the first element a and the second element b.
4. Calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum of a and b using the max and min functions.
5. Update max_diff if the calculated difference is greater than the current max_diff.
6. After iterating through all tuples, return the maximum difference.

# Python program to find the maximum difference between available pairs in the given tuple list
def max_difference(tuples):
    max_diff = 0
    for t in tuples:
        a = t[0]
        b = t[1]
        diff = max(a, b) - min(a, b)
        max_diff = max(max_diff, diff)
    return max_diff

# Test the function
assert max_difference([(3, 5), (1, 7), (10, 3), (1, 2)]) == 7
```

This function works by iterating through each tuple in the tuple list and calculating the difference between the maximum and minimum of each tuple. It keeps track of the maximum difference found so far in the max_diff variable. Finally, it returns the maximum difference found.

In the provided test case, the tuple list is [(3, 5), (1, 7), (10, 3), (1, 2)]. The maximum difference between available pairs in this tuple list is 7 (for the tuple (10, 3)), so the function should return 7.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of tu
