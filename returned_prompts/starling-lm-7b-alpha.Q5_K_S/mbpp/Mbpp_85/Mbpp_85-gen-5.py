"""
The surface area of a sphere is found by the formula 4 * pi * radius^2. This formula is derived from the Pythagorean theorem and the concept of area. The surface area of a sphere is the sum of the areas of all the curved surfaces. Since a sphere is a three-dimensional object, it has curved surfaces on all sides. The curved surfaces are part of a sphere's surface area, and the formula for surface area of a sphere calculates the sum of all of these curved surfaces.
"""

Here's a step by step guide on how to solve this problem:

1. Define a function called `surfacearea_sphere` that takes a parameter called `radius`. This function will calculate and return the surface area of a sphere.

2. Inside the function, calculate the surface area using the formula `4 * pi * radius^2`. The `^` symbol denotes exponentiation in Python. This means that `radius^2` is equal to the square of the radius.

3. Test the function by asserting that the function returns the correct value when given a test radius. The `math.isclose` function is used to check if two values are approximately equal within a specified tolerance. In this case, the tolerance is set to `0.001`.

Here's an example implementation of the solution in Python:

```python
import math

def surfacearea_sphere(radius):
    """
    Calculate the surface area of a sphere.
    """
    return 4 * math.pi * radius**2

# Test the function
assert math.isclose(surfacearea_sphere(10), 1256.6370614359173, rel_tol=0.001)
```

In this code, the `surfacearea_sphere` function is defined to calculate the surface area of a sphere. The `math.pi` constant is used to represent the value of pi. The `**` operator is used for exponentiation. The `assert` statement is used to check if the function returns the correct value when given a test radius of 10.

By running this code, you will see that the function correctly calculates the surface area of a sphere and passes the test.
