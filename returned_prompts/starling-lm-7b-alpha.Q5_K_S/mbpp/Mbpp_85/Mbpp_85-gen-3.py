surfacearea_sphere(r) = 4 * π * r^2

The surface area of a sphere is given by the formula surfacearea_sphere(r) = 4 * π * r^2, where r is the radius of the sphere.

In this case, we need to write a function surfacearea_sphere(r) that calculates and returns the surface area of a sphere with a given radius. We can use the math module in Python to calculate the value of π.

The function takes a single argument r, which is the radius of the sphere. It returns the surface area of the sphere using the formula surfacearea_sphere(r) = 4 * π * r^2.

To test the function, we can use the assert statement to check if the function returns the expected result for a given radius. In this case, we are testing the function with a radius of 10 and expecting the result to be approximately 1256.6370614359173, with a relative tolerance of 0.001.

Finally, we can print the result of the function to verify that it is correct.
