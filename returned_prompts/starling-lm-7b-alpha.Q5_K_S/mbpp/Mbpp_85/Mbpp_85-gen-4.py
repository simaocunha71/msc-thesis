Here's one possible solution to this problem:

```python
import math

def surfacearea_sphere(r):
    """
    Find the surface area of a sphere.
    Args:
        r (float): Radius of the sphere.
    Returns:
        float: Surface area of the sphere.
    """
    # Calculate the surface area of the sphere
    surface_area = 4 * math.pi * r ** 2
    return surface_area
```

In this code, we define a function `surfacearea_sphere` that takes the radius of the sphere as input and returns the surface area. The surface area of a sphere is calculated using the formula $4\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius of the sphere. The result is rounded to the appropriate number of decimal places using the `math.isclose` function.

To test the function, we use the `assert` statement to check if the function correctly calculates the surface area of a sphere with radius 10. The expected result is `1256.6370614359173`, and the relative tolerance is set to `0.001`. If the calculated surface area is close to the expected result within the specified tolerance, the assertion will pass and the function is considered correct. Otherwise, an error will be raised.
