Here's a detailed breakdown of the solution:

1. The function `surfacearea_sphere` takes in one parameter `r`, which is the radius of the sphere.

2. The function uses the formula for the surface area of a sphere, which is `4 * pi * r^2`. Here, `pi` is a mathematical constant, approximately equal to 3.14159.

3. The function returns the calculated surface area of the sphere.

4. The `math.isclose` function is used to check if the output of `surfacearea_sphere(10)` is approximately equal to `1256.6370614359173`, with a relative tolerance of `0.001`. This ensures that the result is within the acceptable range of accuracy.

5. The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block is used to execute the test case. It imports the `pytest` module and runs the `pytest.main([__file__])` command, which in turn executes the test case.

By following this approach, the solution ensures that the surface area of the sphere is accurately calculated and that the test case passes with the specified relative tolerance.
