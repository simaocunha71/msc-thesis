In the above code, the function add_lists takes two parameters, a list and a tuple. It uses the '+' operator to concatenate the list to the tuple and returns the result.

The assert statement is used to verify that the function returns the expected result when given the inputs [5, 6, 7] and (9, 10). It checks whether the result of the function call add_lists([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) is equal to the expected result (9, 10, 5, 6, 7). If the assert statement passes, it means that the function is working correctly.
