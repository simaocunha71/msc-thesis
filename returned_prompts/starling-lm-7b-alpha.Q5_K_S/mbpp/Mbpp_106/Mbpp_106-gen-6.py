"""
In this problem, you need to write a function that takes a list and a tuple as arguments and returns a new tuple that contains the elements of the original tuple followed by the elements of the list. You can use the concatenation operator (++) to concatenate the list and the tuple. Here's an example implementation:

def add_lists(list1, tuple1):
    return tuple1 + list1

You can use this function to solve the problem by calling it with the given list and tuple as arguments. The function will return a new tuple that contains the elements of the original tuple followed by the elements of the list. You can then compare this result with the expected result to verify that your function is working correctly.
"""

from typing import List, Tuple

def add_lists(list1: List[int], tuple1: Tuple[int, ...]) -> Tuple[int, ...]:
    return tuple1 + tuple(list1)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    assert add_lists([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) == (9, 10, 5, 6, 7)
    print("All Tests Passed")
