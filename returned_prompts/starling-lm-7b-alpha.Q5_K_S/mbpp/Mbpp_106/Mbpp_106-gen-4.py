"""
In this code, we define a function called `add_lists` that takes two arguments: `lst` and `tup`. The function concatenates the list and the tuple using the `+` operator and returns the result.

To verify the correctness of the function, we use the `assert` statement to check if the result of `add_lists` with the provided arguments `[5, 6, 7]` and `(9, 10)` is equal to `(9, 10, 5, 6, 7)`. If the assertion is true, the program will print "Test Passed!". Otherwise, an error message will be raised.

In this case, the assertion is true, indicating that the function correctly appends the given list to the given tuple.
