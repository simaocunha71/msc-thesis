def add_lists(list1, tuple1):
    return tuple1 + tuple(list1)

# Test
assert add_lists([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) == (9, 10, 5, 6, 7)

# More tests
assert add_lists([1, 2, 3], (4, 5)) == (4, 5, 1, 2, 3)
assert add_lists([], (1, 2, 3)) == (1, 2, 3)

"""
In this function, we first convert the list to a tuple using the built-in function tuple(), then concatenate the two tuples using the '+' operator. The result is a tuple with the original tuple's elements followed by the original list's elements.
"""

```python

def add_lists(list1, tuple1):
    return tuple1 + tuple(list1)
```

To use the function, simply call it with the desired list and tuple as arguments, like so:

```python
result = add_lists([5, 6, 7], (9, 10))
```

The result will be a tuple that contains the elements of the original tuple followed by the elements of the original list.

```python
print(result)  # Output: (9, 10, 5, 6, 7)
```

You can also test the function with different inputs to ensure it works correctly:

```python
print(add_lists([1, 2, 3], (4, 5)))  # Output: (4, 5, 1, 2, 3)
print(add_lists([], (1, 2, 3)))  # Output: (1, 2, 3)
```

In this way, you can append a list to a tuple using the provided function.
