Explanation:

The function `odd_position` checks whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list. It first checks if the length of the list is even, and if so, it immediately returns False, as an even-length list can not have an odd index. Then, it iterates through the list using a step size of 2, which means it only checks odd-indexed elements. For each pair of odd-indexed elements, it checks if either of them is even (i.e., not odd). If it finds an even number, it returns False. If it iterates through the entire list without finding an even number at an odd index, it returns True, indicating that every odd index contains odd numbers.

In the given example `odd_position([2,1,4,3,6,7,6,3])`, the function correctly returns True, as every odd index contains an odd number.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

- The function `odd_position` takes a list `l` as input.
- It first checks if the length of the list is divisible by 2 using the modulo operator `%`. If it is divisible by 2, it means the length is even, and the function immediately returns False.
- Next, it uses a `for` loop with a step size of 2 to iterate through the list. This means it only checks odd-indexed elements.
- Inside the loop, it checks if either `l[i]` or `l[i+1]` is even using the modulo operator `%`. If either of them is even, it means an even number was found at an odd index, and the function returns False.
- If the loop completes without finding an even number at an odd index, the function returns True, indicating that every odd index contains odd numbers.

Overall, the function checks whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list and returns True if it
