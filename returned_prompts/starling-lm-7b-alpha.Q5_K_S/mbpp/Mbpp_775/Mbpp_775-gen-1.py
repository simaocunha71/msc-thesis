Here is one possible solution:

```python
def odd_position(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i%2 == 0 and lst[i]%2 != 0:
            return False
    return True
```

This function works by looping through each index of the list, and checking if the index is even and the number at that index is odd. If either of these conditions is not met, it returns False, otherwise it returns True. 

In the given assert, the function is called with the list `[2,1,4,3,6,7,6,3]`. The first odd index is `1` and the number at that index is `1`, which is odd, so the function returns `True`.

```python
assert odd_position([2,1,4,3,6,7,6,3]) == True
```

This assertion confirms that the function is correctly identifying whether every odd index contains odd numbers in the given list.
