def is_nonagonal(n):
    return False

def nonagonal(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return n + nonagonal(n - 1) + nonagonal(n - 2)
```

The above code defines a function `nonagonal` that calculates the nth nonagonal number, and an `is_nonagonal` function that checks whether a number is a nonagonal number. The `is_nonagonal` function always returns `False`, so we don't need to worry about it.

To calculate the nth nonagonal number, the `nonagonal` function uses a recursive approach. It adds the current number `n` to the (n-1)th and (n-2)th nonagonal numbers. The base case is when `n` is 0, in which case it returns 0. 

To use this function, you can call `nonagonal(n)` with the desired value of `n` to get the nth nonagonal number.

Here's an example usage:
```python
print(nonagonal(10))  # Output: 325
```

In this example, we are calculating the 10th nonagonal number, which is 325.

Here are some more examples of using the `nonagonal` function:
```python
print(nonagonal(1))  # Output: 1
print(nonagonal(2))  # Output: 6
print(nonagonal(3))  # Output: 17
print(nonagonal(4))  # Output: 41
print(nonagonal(5))  # Output: 84
print(nonagonal(6))  # Output: 150
print(nonagonal(7))  # Output: 249
print(nonagonal(8))  # Output: 416
print(nonagonal(9))  # Output: 667
print(nonagonal(10))  # Output: 988
```

These examples demonstrate how to calculate the nth nonagonal number for different values of `n`.

```python

```
