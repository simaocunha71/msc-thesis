"""
To solve this problem we first need to understand what a nonagonal number is. A nonagonal number is a polygonal number that is the sum of the first n nonagonal numbers. A nonagonal number can be calculated using the following formula:

n(n + 1) / 2 + 1

For example, the 10th nonagonal number is:

10 * 10 + 10 / 2 + 1 = 100 + 5 + 1 = 106

We can solve this problem by writing a function to calculate the nth nonagonal number:

"""

def nonagonal(n):
    return (n ** 2 + n) // 2 + 1


assert nonagonal(10) == 325

# Here's an example of how to use the function:

n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print("The", n, "-th nonagonal number is:", nonagonal(n))
