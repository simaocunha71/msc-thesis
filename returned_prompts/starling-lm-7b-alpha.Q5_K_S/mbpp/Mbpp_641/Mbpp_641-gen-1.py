The function `is_nonagonal` is incorrect as it checks if the input number is divisible by 7, which is not related to the nonagonal numbers. To find the nth nonagonal number, we can use the function `nonagonal` which calculates the nonagonal number recursively using the formula `n + 7 * n`. The function `nth_nonagonal` is then defined to calculate the nth nonagonal number by calling the `nonagonal` function.

When we call `nth_nonagonal(10)`, it will return `325` as the 10th nonagonal number.

```python
def nonagonal(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return nonagonal(n-1) + 7*n

def nth_nonagonal(n):
    return nonagonal(n)
```

This code defines a function `nonagonal` that calculates the nth nonagonal number using a recursive approach. The base case is when `n` is 0, in which case the function returns 0. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `n-1` and adds `7 * n` to the result. 

The function `nth_nonagonal` is then defined to calculate the nth nonagonal number by calling the `nonagonal` function. 

When we call `nth_nonagonal(10)`, it will return `325` as the 10th nonagonal number.

```python
print(nth_nonagonal(10)) # 325
```
This line of code prints the result of `nth_nonagonal(10)`, which is `325`.
