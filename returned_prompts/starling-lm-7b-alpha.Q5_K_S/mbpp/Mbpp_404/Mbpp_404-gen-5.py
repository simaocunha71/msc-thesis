"""
Explanation:
The function takes two arguments, a and b. It compares the two arguments and returns the smaller one.

In the test, we pass the arguments 1 and 2 to the function. The function compares these two numbers and returns 1 as it is the smaller number.

The assert statement is used to check if the output of the function is correct. If the output is incorrect, the program will raise an error.
