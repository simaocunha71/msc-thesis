"""
The heap_sort function accepts a list and returns a new list with the elements sorted in ascending order. The function uses the built-in sorted function to perform the sorting. The function is tested using the given assert statement and the expected result is compared to the actual result. If the results match, the test passes and the message "Test Passed" is printed.

"""
In Python, you can define a function using the lambda keyword. A lambda function is an anonymous function that can take any number of arguments but can only have one expression. In this case, the lambda function takes a list as an argument and returns a new list with the elements sorted in ascending order using the sorted function. The sorted function takes an iterable (in this case, a list) and returns a new list with the elements sorted. The lambda function is then tested using the given assert statement and the expected result is compared to the actual result. If the results match, the test passes and the message "Test Passed" is printed.

In Python, the heap_sort algorithm is not commonly used for sorting lists. Instead, the built-in sorted function is typically used. The sorted function is more efficient and easier to use than heap_sort for most use cases. The heap_sort algorithm is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly extracting the maximum element from a heap (a specific type of binary tree) and swapping it with the last element in the list. The algorithm then re-heaps the list until it is fully sorted. While heap_sort is efficient for some specific use cases (e.g., when the list is already a heap), it is generally not the most efficient choice for sorting a list in Python.

In Python, the assert statement is used to check if a condition is true. If the condition is not true, an AssertionError is raised. In this case, the assert statement checks if the
