def sum_range_list(lst, start, stop):
    return sum(lst[i] for i in range(start, stop))

# Test Case
print(sum_range_list([2,1,5,6,8,3,4,9,10,11,8,12], 8, 10))  # Should be 29


# Explanation
The function takes a list of numbers, and two indices, start and stop, as parameters. It returns the sum of the numbers in the list between the indices.

In the function definition, the sum() function is used to calculate the sum of the numbers in the range specified by the start and stop indices. The range is created using the range() function, and the numbers in the range are selected using a list comprehension.

The list comprehension iterates over the indices in the range, and for each index, it selects the corresponding element from the list. These selected elements are then added together using the sum() function, which returns the sum of the numbers in the specified range.

Finally, the function is tested with the provided test case, and the expected result of 29 is printed to the console.
