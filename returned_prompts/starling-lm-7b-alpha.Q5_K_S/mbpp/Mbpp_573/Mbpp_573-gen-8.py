"""
In this code, a function called unique_product is defined, which calculates the product of the unique numbers in a given list.
The function first creates a set called nums_set to store the unique numbers from the input list nums. Then, it initializes a variable called product to 1.
Next, the function iterates over each number in nums_set and multiplies it with the current value of product.
Finally, the function returns the calculated product.
To test the function, an assert statement is used to check if the function returns the expected result for a given example input.
