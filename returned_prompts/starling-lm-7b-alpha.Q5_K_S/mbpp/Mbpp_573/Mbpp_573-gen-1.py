"""
The function takes a list as an argument. It first converts the list to a set which automatically removes all duplicate values. Then it uses the reduce function from the functools module to calculate the product of all the numbers in the set. The operator module is used to specify that the reduce function should use multiplication as the operation.
"""


"""
To write a python function to calculate the product of the unique numbers in a given list, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the reduce function from the functools module and the mul operator from the operator module.
2. Define a function called unique_product that takes a list as an argument.
3. Inside the function, convert the list to a set using the set() function. This will automatically remove all duplicate values from the list.
4. Use the reduce function with the mul operator to calculate the product of all the numbers in the set.
5. Return the result of the reduce function.
6. Test the function with a sample list, such as [10, 20, 30, 40, 20, 50, 60, 40], and assert that the result is equal to 720000000.
"""


"""
The time complexity of this function is O(n log n) due to the reduce function and the O(n) time complexity of the set constructor. The space complexity is O(n) as the set constructor requires additional space proportional to the size of the input.
"""


"""
The function can handle lists of any length, but the result will be incorrect if the list contains zero or negative values. This is because multiplication of zero or negative values will result in a product of zero, and the reduce function will not be able to calculate the product accurately.
