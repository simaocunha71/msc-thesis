# Tests
print(round_and_sum([22.4, 4.0, -16.22, -9.10, 11.00, -12.22, 14.20, -5.20, 17.50]))  # 243


# Explanation:
# This function rounds every number in the given list to the nearest integer,
# and then multiplies the sum of the rounded numbers by the length of the rounded list.
# The "rounded_nums" list comprehension uses a conditional expression to round each number to the nearest integer,
# and a list comprehension to generate a new list of rounded numbers.
# The "round" function rounds a number to the nearest integer, and the "ceil" function rounds a number up to the nearest integer.
# The "sum" function calculates the sum of all the numbers in a list, and the "len" function calculates the length of a list.
# The function then returns the product of the sum and the length.
