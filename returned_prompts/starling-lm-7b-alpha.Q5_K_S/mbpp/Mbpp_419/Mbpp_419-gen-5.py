To round every number in a list, you can use the round() function. After rounding each number, you can sum them up using the sum() function and multiply the result by the length of the list. Here's a step-by-step guide to solving the problem:

1. Define a function called round_and_sum that takes a list of numbers as input.
2. Inside the function, use the round() function to round each number in the list. You can use a list comprehension to achieve this, as shown below:
   rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
3. After rounding all the numbers, use the sum() function to calculate the sum of all the rounded numbers:
   rounded_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
4. Multiply the rounded sum by the length of the original list:
   result = rounded_sum * len(numbers)
5. Return the result from the function.
6. Outside the function, define a test list of numbers:
   test_list = [22.4, 4.0, -16.22, -9.10, 11.00, -12.22, 14.20, -5.20, 17.50]
7. Call the round_and_sum function with the test list as input and assert that the result is equal to 243, as given in the problem statement.

Here's the complete solution:

def round_and_sum(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    rounded_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    result = rounded_sum * len(numbers)
    return result

test_list = [22.4, 4.0, -16.22, -9.10, 11.00, -12.22, 14.20, -5.20, 17.50]
assert round_and_sum(test_list) == 243
