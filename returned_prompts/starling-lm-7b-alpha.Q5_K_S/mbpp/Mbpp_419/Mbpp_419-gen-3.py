# Explanation:
# The function `round_and_sum` takes in a list of numbers as an argument. Inside the function, a variable `total` is initialized to 0. Then, a `for` loop is used to iterate through each number in the list. During each iteration, the current number is rounded using the `round()` function and added to the `total` variable. After all the numbers have been processed, the function returns the product of the `total` and the length of the input list. Finally, the function is called with the given list `[22.4, 4.0, -16.22, -9.10, 11.00, -12.22, 14.20, -5.20, 17.50]` and the result is printed, which should be `243`.
