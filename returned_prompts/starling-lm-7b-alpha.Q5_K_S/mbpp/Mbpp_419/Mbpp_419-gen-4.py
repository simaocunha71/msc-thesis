To solve the above problem, we can follow the steps mentioned below:

1. Create a function called round_and_sum that takes a list of numbers as a parameter.
2. Inside the function, initialize a variable called sum to 0. This variable will be used to calculate the sum of all the numbers in the list.
3. Iterate through each number in the list using a for loop.
4. For each number, round it using the round() function and add the rounded number to the sum variable.
5. After iterating through all the numbers, return the sum.
6. Outside the function, call the round_and_sum function with the given list of numbers and assert that the result is equal to 243.

Here is the Python code for the above steps:
"""

def round_and_sum(nums):
    sum = 0
    for num in nums:
        sum += round(num)
    return sum

assert round_and_sum([22.4, 4.0, -16.22, -9.10, 11.00, -12.22, 14.20, -5.20, 17.50]) == 243

"""
In the above code, we have defined a function called round_and_sum that takes a list of numbers as a parameter. Inside the function, we have initialized a variable called sum to 0. We then iterate through each number in the list using a for loop and add the rounded number to the sum variable. Finally, we return the sum. Outside the function, we call the round_and_sum function with the given list of numbers and assert that the result is equal to 243.

The round_and_sum function will return the sum of all the numbers in the list after rounding them. The assert statement is used to check if the result of the round_and_sum function is equal to the expected value of 243. If the result is not equal to 243, the assert statement will raise an AssertionError, indicating that the function is not working correctly.
