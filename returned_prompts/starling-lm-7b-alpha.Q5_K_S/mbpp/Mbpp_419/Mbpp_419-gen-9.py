# Here is a Python program that defines a function called round_and_sum that takes a list of numbers as input and prints the total sum of the rounded numbers multiplied by the length of the list. The function uses a for loop to iterate over each number in the list and rounds each number using the round() function. The rounded numbers are then added to the total_sum variable. Finally, the total_sum is multiplied by the length of the list and printed.

# The function is tested by calling it with the input [22.4, 4.0, -16.22, -9.10, 11.00, -12.22, 14.20, -5.20, 17.50] and asserts that the output is 243.

# This program can be used to round any list of numbers and calculate the total sum of the rounded numbers multiplied by the length of the list.

# The assert statement is used to check if the result of the function call is equal to the expected result of 243. If the condition is true, the assert statement does nothing and the program continues. If the condition is false, an AssertionError is raised and the program term
