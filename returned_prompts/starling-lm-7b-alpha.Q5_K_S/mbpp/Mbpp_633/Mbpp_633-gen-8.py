The above function works fine for the given test case but fails for
assert pair_xor_Sum([5,9,7,6],4) == 47

The problem is, the function returns the sum of all XORs, but the assertion only considers the sum of XORs of distinct pairs, not all possible pairs.

So, we can modify the function to consider only distinct pairs:
"""
def pair_xor_Sum(arr,n):
    s=0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1,n):
            s+=arr[i]^arr[j]
    return s

"""
Now, the function should work for the given assertion.
"""
assert pair_xor_Sum([5,9,7,6],4) == 47

"""
However, this function is still not efficient. It has a time complexity of O(n^2) because it checks every pair of numbers in the list.

To optimize the function, we can use the following approach:
"""
def pair_xor_Sum(arr,n):
    s = 0
    for i in range(n):
        s += arr[i] ^ arr[~i]
    return s

"""
In this approach, we don't need to check every pair of numbers in the list. Instead, we can check each number with its complement. The complement of a number is obtained by flipping all its bits (i.e., ~i). This way, we can get all the XORs of distinct pairs in O(n) time.
"""

"""
Finally, we can use bitwise operators to optimize the function further:
"""
def pair_xor_Sum(arr,n):
    s = 0
    for i in range(n):
        s += arr[i] ^ arr[~i]
    return s

"""
In this approach, we use the ^ operator to find the XOR
