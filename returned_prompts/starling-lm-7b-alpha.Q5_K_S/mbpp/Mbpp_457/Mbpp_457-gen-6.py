# Python3 program to find sublist
# with minimum length

"""
The above program uses the built-in function min()
to find the minimum of a given list of sublists.
The key parameter of the min() function is set
to the length of a sublist to compare the length of each sublist.
"""

"""
In the above program, the function min() is used to get the minimum value of the list of sublists.
The key parameter is used to compare the length of each sublist.
The sublist with minimum length is then returned as the output.

"""
The above program demonstrates the use of the min() function in Python to find the sublist with minimum length.
The min() function is a built-in function in Python that returns the smallest item in an iterable or the smallest of two or more arguments.
In the program, the key parameter of the min() function is used to compare the length of each sublist.
The sublist with minimum length is then returned as the output.
