Explanation:

The function Find_Min(arr) takes a list of lists as its input and initializes a variable minlen to the length of the first sublist. It then iterates through each sublist in the input list and compares its length to the current minimum length. If a sublist has a length shorter than the current minimum length, the minimum length is updated. Finally, the function returns a list containing the minimum length.

In the provided test case, the input list is [[1], [1,2], [1,2,3]]. The length of the first sublist is 1, which is assigned to minlen. The length of the second sublist is 2, which is not shorter than minlen, so minlen remains unchanged. The length of the third sublist is 3, which is also not shorter than minlen, so minlen remains unchanged. Since no shorter sublist is found, the function returns [1] as the minimum length.

Note that the function assumes that the input list is non-empty and contains at least one sublist.

It's worth mentioning that the function can be optimized by directly returning the minimum length instead of creating a separate list. Additionally, the function can be modified to handle empty or partially filled lists by adding appropriate error handling or default values.

Overall, the provided solution correctly solves the problem of finding the sublist with the minimum length in a given list of lists.
