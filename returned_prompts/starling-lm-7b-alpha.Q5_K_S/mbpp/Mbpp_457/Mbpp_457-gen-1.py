Here is one possible solution:

```python
def Find_Min(input_list):
    length = 999999999
    for sublist in input_list:
        if len(sublist) < length:
            length = len(sublist)
    return length
```

This function uses a for loop to iterate over the input_list. For each sublist in the input_list, it compares the length of the sublist to the current length. If the length of the sublist is shorter than the current length, it updates the length to the length of the sublist. After iterating over all sublists, it returns the minimum length found.

Note: The initial value of length is set to a very large number (999999999) to ensure that any length encountered in the input_list will be shorter than the initial length.

The assert statement in the question is used to test the function and verify that it correctly finds the minimum length of a sublist in the given example.

```python
assert Find_Min([[1],[1,2],[1,2,3]]) == [1]
```

This assert statement checks if the function Find_Min returns the correct result for the given input_list [1], [1,2], [1,2,3]. The expected result is [1], which is the sublist with the minimum length. The assert statement will raise an error if the actual result does not match the expected result.
```

```

Here is an alternative solution using the built-in `min` function in Python, which can find the minimum of a list of values:

```python
def Find_Min(input_list):
    return min(len(sublist) for sublist in input_list)
```

This function uses a generator expression `(len(sublist) for sublist in input_list)` to calculate the length of each sublist in the input_list. The `min` function then finds the smallest value in the resulting list of lengths. This approach is more concise and efficient than the previous solution, as it eliminates the need for a separate variable to store the minimum length.

The assert statement in the question can still be used to test this alternative solution:
