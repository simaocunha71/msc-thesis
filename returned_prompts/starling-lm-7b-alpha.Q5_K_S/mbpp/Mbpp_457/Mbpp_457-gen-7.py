Explanation:
In the first approach, we initialize the sublist_length to the length of the first sublist in the given sublist.
Then, we iterate over all the sublists in the given sublist, and if the length of the current sublist is less than the sublist_length, then we update the sublist_length to the length of the current sublist.
Finally, we return the sublist_length, which is the length of the sublist with the minimum length in the given sublist.

In the second approach, we use the built-in min() function in Python, which allows us to find the minimum value in an iterable.
We pass the sublist as the iterable and use the len() function as the key to compare the lengths of the sublists. This way, the min() function will return the sublist with the minimum length.

Both approaches will give the same result
