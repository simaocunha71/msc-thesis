Here's a Python function that finds the sublist with minimum length in a given list of sublists:

```python
def Find_Min(sublists):
    min_length = len(sublists[0])
    min_sublist = sublists[0]
    for sublist in sublists:
        if len(sublist) < min_length:
            min_length = len(sublist)
            min_sublist = sublist
    return min_sublist
```

To use this function, pass in a list of sublists as the `sublists` argument. The function will iterate through the sublists, comparing the length of each sublist to the current minimum length. If a shorter sublist is found, it will update the minimum length and store the new sublist as the minimum sublist. Finally, the function will return the minimum sublist.

In the provided example, `Find_Min([[1],[1,2],[1,2,3]])` will return `[1]` since it is the sublist with the minimum length of 1.

```python
assert Find_Min([[1],[1,2],[1,2,3]]) == [1]
```

This assertion checks if the function `Find_Min` returns the expected result for the given example, which is `[1]`. If the assertion passes, it means that the function is working correctly.

```python
def Find_Min(sublists):
    min_length = len(sublists[0])
    min_sublist = sublists[0]
    for sublist in sublists:
        if len(sublist) < min_length:
            min_length = len(sublist)
            min_sublist = sublist
    return min_sublist

assert Find_Min([[1],[1,2],[1,2,3]]) == [1]
```

This code snippet demonstrates the usage of the `Find_Min` function and the assertion to verify its correctness.

```python
def Find_Min(sublists):
    min_length = len(sublists[0])
    min_sublist = sublists[0]
    for sublist in
