Here is a Python function that finds the sublist with the minimum length:

```python
def Find_Min(list):
    min_length = len(list[0])
    min_list = list[0]
    for i in range(len(list)):
        if len(list[i]) < min_length:
            min_length = len(list[i])
            min_list = list[i]
    return min_list
```

This function takes a list as input and iterates through each sublist. It keeps track of the minimum length and the sublist with the minimum length. If a sublist with a shorter length is found, it updates the minimum length and the minimum sublist. Finally, it returns the sublist with the minimum length.

In the provided example, the function `Find_Min` is called with the input `[[1],[1,2],[1,2,3]]`. The minimum length among these sublists is 1, and the sublist with the minimum length is `[1]`. Therefore, the function returns `[1]` as expected.

You can test this function by running the provided assert statement. It checks if the function correctly identifies the sublist with the minimum length in the given input. If the assertion passes, it means that the function is working correctly.

This function can be useful in scenarios where you need to find the shortest sublist within a given list of sublists.

```python
def Find_Min(list):
    min_length = len(list[0])
    min_list = list[0]
    for i in range(len(list)):
        if len(list[i]) < min_length:
            min_length = len(list[i])
            min_list = list[i]
    return min_list
```

To use this function, you can simply call it with a list of sublists as the argument. For example:

```python
my_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6]]
result = Find_Min(my_list)
print(result)  # Output: [4, 5]
```

In this example, the function `Find_Min` is called with
