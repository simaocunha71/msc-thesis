"""
To find the surface area of a cube, we simply need to calculate the area of one side and then multiply by 6, as a cube has 6 sides of equal area. The area of one side of a cube can be found by squaring the length of one of its edges. Here's a Python function that calculates the surface area of a cube:

def surfacearea_cube(edge):
  area_one_side = edge**2
  return 6 * area_one_side

To check if the function works correctly, you can use the `assert` keyword to compare the result of the function for a specific edge length with the expected result. In this case, the expected result is 150 for an edge length of 5. Here's how you can do it:

assert surfacearea_cube(5) == 150

Running this assertion will raise an error if the function does not return the correct result.

  area_one_side = edge**2
  return 6 * area_one_side

assert surfacearea_cube(5)==150
