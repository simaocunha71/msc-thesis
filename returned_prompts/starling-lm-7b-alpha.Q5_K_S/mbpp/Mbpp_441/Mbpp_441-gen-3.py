```
def surfacearea_cube(n):
    return 6 * n ** 2
```

Here is how you can use this function:

```python
print(surfacearea_cube(5)) # prints: 150
```

This function uses the formula for the surface area of a cube, which is 6 * side_length ** 2.

In other words, the surface area of a cube is equal to the area of the 6 faces of the cube, each of which has a side length equal to the side length of the cube.

In the formula, n is the side length of the cube.

In the provided example, the function surfacearea_cube(5) returns 150, which is the surface area of a cube with side length 5.

The function surfacearea_cube(n) returns 6 * n ** 2, which is the surface area of a cube with side length n.

You can use this function to calculate the surface area of any cube of any size.

Here's an example of how to use this function:

```python
print(surfacearea_cube(3)) # prints: 54
```

This function is useful when you need to calculate the surface area of a cube, as it provides a simple and straightforward way to do so.

It's important to note that this function assumes that the cube has square faces, as is typical for a cube. If the cube has rectangular or irregular faces, you would need to use a different approach to calculate the surface area.

In summary, the function surfacearea_cube(n) calculates the surface area of a cube with side length n using the formula 6 * n ** 2. It can be used to calculate the surface area of any cube of any size.
