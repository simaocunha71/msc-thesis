# Python program to find the surface area of a cube
def surfacearea_cube(side):
    return 6 * (side ** 2)
```

In the above code, the `surfacearea_cube` function calculates the surface area of a cube given the length of one of its sides. It returns the surface area of the cube, calculated as six times the square of the side length.

To verify the correctness of the function, the `assert` statement is used to check if the function returns the expected result for a cube side length of 5, which is 150. If the assertion is true, the program will continue running; if it's false, an error will be raised.

You can test the function by calling it with different side lengths and verifying the results. For example, if you call `surfacearea_cube(3)`, it will return 54, as the surface area of a cube with a side length of 3 is 54.

By using this function, you can easily calculate the surface area of a cube in Python.

```python
# Example usage:
side_length = 4
surface_area = surfacearea_cube(side_length)
print("The surface area of a cube with side length", side_length, "is", surface_area)
```

The output will be:
```
The surface area of a cube with side length 4 is 96
```
This demonstrates how you can use the `surfacearea_cube` function to find the surface area of a cube with a specific side length.

Additionally, you can also add error handling to the function to ensure that the input side length is a positive number. This can be done using conditional statements (`if` statements) to check if the side length is greater than zero. If it's not, an error message can be raised or returned to indicate that the input is invalid.

By incorporating error handling, you can further enhance the reliability and robustness of the `surfacearea_cube` function.

Overall, the provided function and example usage demonstrate a simple and effective approach to finding the surface area of a cube in Python.
