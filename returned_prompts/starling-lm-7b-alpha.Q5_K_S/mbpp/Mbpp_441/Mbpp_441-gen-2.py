```
def surfacearea_cube(side):
    return 6 * side ** 2
```

Explanation:
The surface area of a cube can be calculated by multiplying the length of one side by itself, and then multiplying the result by 6.

In the function `surfacearea_cube`, we calculate the surface area of the cube by using the formula `6 * side ** 2`. This formula takes the length of one side of the cube (`side`) and squares it (`side ** 2`). Then, we multiply the result by 6 (`6 * side ** 2`) to get the surface area.

To verify the correctness of the function, we can use the `assert` statement to check if the result of `surfacearea_cube(5)` is equal to `150`. If the condition is true, the assertion passes and the program continues to execute. Otherwise, an error is raised.

In this case, since the surface area of a cube with a side length of 5 is indeed 150, the assertion passes and the program executes without any errors.

Overall, the function `surfacearea_cube` provides an accurate calculation of the surface area of a cube, and the `assert` statement ensures the correctness of the result.

Here's an example of how to use the `surfacearea_cube` function:

```python
side = 5
print(surfacearea_cube(side))  # Output: 150
```

By passing the side length of the cube to the `surfacearea_cube` function, we can obtain the surface area of the cube.

Note: It's important to note that the `surfacearea_cube` function assumes the input is a positive integer representing the side length of the cube. If the input is not a positive integer, it may result in incorrect calculations or errors.

Additionally, it's worth mentioning that the `assert` statement is a debugging tool that allows you to check if a condition is true. If the condition is false, an `AssertionError` is raised, providing information about the failed assertion. While the `assert` statement is useful for debugging purposes, it is not necessary for
