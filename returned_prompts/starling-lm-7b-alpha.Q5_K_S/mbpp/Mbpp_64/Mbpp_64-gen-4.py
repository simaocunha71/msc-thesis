Explanation:

In the above code, we are taking a list of tuples as an argument and named it as 'marks_list'. We are then using the built-in Python function 'sort' to sort the list of tuples based on the second element of the tuple. This is done by passing a lambda function as the 'key' parameter to the 'sort' function. The lambda function takes a tuple as an argument and returns the second element of the tuple. After sorting the list, we return the sorted list.

In the 'test_subject_marks' function, we are testing the 'subject_marks' function by passing a sample list of tuples and comparing the result with the expected output. If the result matches the expected output, the function will print "All Test cases are passed."
