The function `text_match_three` uses regex to check if the string passed to it contains an 'a' followed by three 'b's. The regular expression `r"a.*b{3}"` means that it will match any string that starts with an 'a', followed by any number of any character (denoted by `.*`), followed by exactly three 'b's (denoted by `b{3}`).

In the assert statement `assert not text_match_three("ac")`, we are passing the string "ac" to the `text_match_three` function. Since the string "ac" doesn't have an 'a' followed by three 'b's, the function will return `False`, and the assert statement will pass.

Here's a breakdown of how the function works:

1. The function `text_match_three` takes a single parameter `text`, which is the string we want to check.
2. The regular expression pattern `r"a.*b{3}"` is defined. This pattern will match any string that starts with an 'a', followed by any number of any character (denoted by `.*`), followed by exactly three 'b's (denoted by `b{3}`).
3. The `re.search` function is used to search for a match of the pattern in the `text` string. If a match is found, the function returns a `Match` object. If no match is found, it returns `None`.
4. The match object is stored in the variable `match`. If a match is found (i.e., `match` is not `None`), the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

In the given assert statement, we are checking if the function returns `False` for the string "ac". Since the string "ac" doesn't have an 'a' followed by three 'b's, the function will return `False`, and the assert statement will pass.
