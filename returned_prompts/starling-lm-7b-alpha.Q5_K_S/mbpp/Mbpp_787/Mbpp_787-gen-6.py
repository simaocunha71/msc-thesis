Here are several ways you could write this function:

```python
def text_match_three(s):
    if len(s) < 4:
        return False
    return s[0] == 'a' and s[1:4] == 'bbb'
```

The function `text_match_three` checks whether the first character of the string is an `'a'` and the next three characters are `'bbb'`.
If `s` is not at least four characters long, the function immediately returns `False`; otherwise, it checks the two conditions.

This function is an example of a naive approach to pattern matching. It checks whether the string matches the pattern, rather than scanning the string from left to right and finding a match along the way.

The function runs in linear time, `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the input string.

The space usage is `O(1)`, as the function does not use any extra space that grows with the input size.
