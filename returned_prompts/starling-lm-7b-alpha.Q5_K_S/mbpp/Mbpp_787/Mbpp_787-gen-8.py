"""
Here's a function that matches a string that has an 'a' followed by three 'b's:

def text_match_three(text):
    if len(text) < 4:
        return False
    if text[0] == 'a' and text[1:4] == 'bbb':
        return True
    else:
        return False
"""

This function takes in a string and checks if the length of the string is less than 4. If it is, the function immediately returns False since the condition for matching an 'a' followed by three 'b's cannot be met.

If the length of the string is 4 or more, the function checks if the first character of the string is 'a' and if the next three characters form the string 'bbb'. If both conditions are met, the function returns True, indicating that the string matches the condition.

If the conditions are not met, the function returns False, indicating that the string does not match the condition.

In the provided example, the function is called with the string "ac" as an argument. Since the length of the string is less than 4, the function immediately returns False.

To test the function, you can use the assert statement to verify the expected result. In this case, you can assert that the function should return False when given the string "ac". If the assertion holds true, the program will not raise an error and continue executing.

The assert statement is a built-in function in Python that allows you to check if a condition is met. If the condition is false, the program raises an AssertionError with an error message. In this case, the error message would be "text_match_three('ac')" since that's what's being asserted.

By using the assert statement, you can help ensure that your code is functioning correctly and meeting the expected conditions.

Here's an example of how you can use the assert statement to test the function:

```python
def test_text_match_three():
    assert not text_match_three("ac")

test_text_match_three()
```

In this example, the function `test_text_match_three()` is defined to call the `text_match_three()` function with the string "
