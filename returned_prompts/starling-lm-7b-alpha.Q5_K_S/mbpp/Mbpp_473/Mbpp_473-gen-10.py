To find the intersection of all tuples in the list, you can use the built-in set intersection method. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Convert each tuple in the list to a set. This will remove any duplicate elements within each tuple. For example, the tuple (3, 4) will be converted to the set {3, 4}.

2. Use the intersection method to find the intersection of all the sets. The intersection method returns a new set that contains only the elements that are common to all sets. In this case, the intersection of {3, 4} and {5, 4} is {4, 5}.

3. Convert the resulting set back to a tuple. Since sets are unordered, the resulting tuple may not be in the same order as the original tuples in the list. However, since the order of elements in a tuple doesn't matter, this is not a problem.

Here's some sample Python code that demonstrates this approach:

```python
def tuple_intersection(*tuples):
    sets = [set(t) for t in tuples]
    return tuple(set.intersection(*sets))
```

This function takes any number of tuples as arguments and returns a tuple containing the intersection of all the tuples.

For example, if you call `tuple_intersection((3, 4), (5, 6), (9, 10), (4, 5))`, the function will return `(4, 5)`. If you call `tuple_intersection((5, 4), (3, 4), (6, 5), (9, 11))`, the function will return `(3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6)`.

This approach works regardless of the number of tuples in the list, and regardless of the size of the tuples.

It's worth noting that the intersection of all tuples in a list is not necessarily a tuple. For example, if you have the tuples `((1, 2), (3, 4))` and `((5, 6), (7, 8))`, the intersection is an empty set, which is not a tuple.

If you want to ensure that the intersection is always a tuple,
