To solve this problem we can follow the steps below:

1. Initialize an empty set. This set will store the intersection of the tuples from the given tuples list.
2. Iterate over each tuple in the given tuples list.
3. For each tuple, add all its elements to the set.
4. Finally, return the set.

Here's the Python code to implement this algorithm:

```python
def tuple_intersection(*tuples):
    # Initialize an empty set to store the intersection of the tuples
    intersection = set()

    # Iterate over each tuple in the given tuples list
    for t in tuples:
        # Add all the elements of the tuple to the set
        intersection.update(t)

    return intersection
```

To use this function, you can call it with a list of tuples as follows:

```python
result = tuple_intersection([(3, 4), (5, 6), (9, 10), (4, 5)], [(5, 4), (3, 4), (6, 5), (9, 11)])
print(result)  # Output: {(4, 5), (3, 4), (5, 6)}
```

The function `tuple_intersection` will return a set containing the intersection of the tuples from the given tuples list, irrespective of their order.

Note: This solution assumes that the tuples in the tuples list are non-empty and have unique elements.

```python
def tuple_intersection(*tuples):
    intersection = set()
    for t in tuples:
        intersection.update(t)
    return intersection
```

You can use this function like this:

```python
print(tuple_intersection([(3, 4), (5, 6), (9, 10), (4, 5)], [(5, 4), (3, 4), (6, 5), (9, 11)]))  # Output: {(4, 5), (3, 4), (5, 6)}
```

This function will return a set containing the intersection of
