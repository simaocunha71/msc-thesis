To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Define a function called tuple_intersection that takes in a list of tuples as its input.
2. Create an empty set called result to store the intersection of the tuples.
3. Iterate through each tuple in the input list. For each tuple, check if each element is present in any other tuple in the list. If an element is present in another tuple, add the entire tuple to the result set.
4. After iterating through all the tuples, convert the result set to a list and return it as the output.

Here's an implementation of the solution in Python:

def tuple_intersection(tuples):
    result = set()
    for t in tuples:
        for e in t:
            if any(e in t_ for t_ in tuples if t_ != t):
                result.add(t)
    return list(result)

To test the function with the given example, you can use the following code:

assert tuple_intersection([(3, 4), (5, 6), (9, 10), (4, 5)] , [(5, 4), (3, 4), (6, 5), (9, 11)]) == {(4, 5), (3, 4), (5, 6)}

This will assert that the function correctly returns the intersection of the tuples in the given example.
