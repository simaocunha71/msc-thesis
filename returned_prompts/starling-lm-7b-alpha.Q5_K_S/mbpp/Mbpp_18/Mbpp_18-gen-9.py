The function can be optimized to have a time complexity of O(|s1| + |s2|) using a set:

optimized_remove_dirty_chars("probasscurve", "pros")
# It should return "bacuve"

"""
The optimized function creates two sets: one from the first string and one from the second string.
Then, it iterates through the second set and removes all occurrences of the character from the first set.
Finally, it joins the first set back into a string and returns it.
