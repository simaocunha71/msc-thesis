def remove_dirty_chars(string1, string2):
    for char in string2:
        if char in string1:
            string1 = string1.replace(char, "")
    return string1
```

Explanation:
The function remove_dirty_chars(string1, string2) takes two strings as input. It iterates over each character in the second string, and if the character is present in the first string, it replaces the character with an empty string. This effectively removes the characters from the first string that are present in the second string. Finally, the modified first string is returned as the output.

In the given assertion, the function remove_dirty_chars("probasscurve", "pros") is called, where "probasscurve" is the first string and "pros" is the second string. The function removes the characters 'p' and 'o' from the first string, resulting in the modified string "bacuve". The assertion checks if the output of the function is equal to the expected result 'bacuve', and if it is, the assertion passes.

Overall, the function remove_dirty_chars(string1, string2) is a useful tool for removing specific characters from a string based on a given pattern or set of characters.

Note: The function uses the replace() method to replace the characters in the string. However, it's important to note that the replace() method does not modify the original string, but instead creates a new string with the replacements. To ensure that the original string is modified, you can assign the result of the replace() method back to the original string variable.

In the given function, we can see that it uses a loop to iterate over each character in the second string. Inside the loop, it checks if the character is present in the first string using the in operator. If the character is found in the first string, it replaces the character with an empty string using the replace() method. This effectively
