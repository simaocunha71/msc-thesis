"""
In this solution, we use a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the first string (string_1). For each character, we check if it is present in the second string (string_2). If it is not, we include it in the result string using the ''.join() function.

The ''.join() function is used to concatenate the characters in the result list into a single string.

Finally, we assert that the expected output is 'bacuve' when the function is called with the provided arguments.
