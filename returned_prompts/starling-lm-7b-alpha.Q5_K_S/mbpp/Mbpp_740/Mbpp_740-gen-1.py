```
def tuple_to_dict(t):
    d = {}
    for i in range(0, len(t), 2):
        d[t[i]] = t[i+1]
    return d
```

The function `tuple_to_dict` takes a tuple as an input and returns a dictionary. It initializes an empty dictionary `d`. Then, it uses a `for` loop to iterate over the tuple `t` with a step size of 2. Inside the loop, it assigns the key-value pair to the dictionary `d` by using the first element of the tuple `t[i]` as the key and the second element `t[i+1]` as the value. Finally, it returns the resulting dictionary `d`.

To test the function, you can use the `assert` statement to check if the output of `tuple_to_dict((1, 5, 7, 10, 13, 5))` is equal to the expected dictionary `{1: 5, 7: 10, 13: 5}`. If the condition is true, the assertion passes and no error is raised.

This code snippet provides a solution to the problem of converting a tuple to a key-value dictionary using adjacent elements.

```python
def tuple_to_dict(t):
    d = {}
    for i in range(0, len(t), 2):
        d[t[i]] = t[i+1]
    return d
```

To use this function, you can simply call it with a tuple as an argument. For example, `tuple_to_dict((1, 5, 7, 10, 13, 5))` will return the dictionary `{1: 5, 7: 10, 13: 5}`.

Here's an example of how you can use the `tuple_to_dict` function:

```python
result = tuple_to_dict((1, 5, 7, 10, 13, 5))
print(result)  # Output: {1: 5, 7: 10, 13: 5}
```
