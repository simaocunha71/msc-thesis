# Explanation:
# This function takes a tuple as input and checks if it is valid. It then uses a dictionary comprehension to create a dictionary where each key-value pair is created using the adjacent elements in the tuple.
# The function uses the `assert` keyword to ensure that the tuple is of type `tuple`, has an even number of elements, and all elements are integers. If any of these conditions are not met, an `AssertionError` is raised.
# Once the input tuple is validated, the function uses a dictionary comprehension to iterate over the tuple with a step of 2 (to access the adjacent elements). For each iteration, it creates a key-value pair in the dictionary where the key is the current element and the value is the next element.
# Finally, the function returns the created dictionary.
# The test case provided in the question is used to verify that the function is working correctly.

# Complexity:
# The function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input tuple. This is because it iterates over the tuple once to create the dictionary.
# The function has a space complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input tuple. This is because it creates a dictionary with n key-value pairs.
# Overall, the function is efficient for small to moderately-sized input tuples, but may not be ideal for very large tuples due to the linear time and space complexity.
