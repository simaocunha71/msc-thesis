"""
The given problem states to convert a tuple to a dictionary using adjacent elements.
Here is a step-by-step explanation of the code:

Step 1: Initialize the dictionary with the first element of the tuple as key and the second element as value.
Step 2: Iterate through the tuple starting from the third index until the end. For each iteration, update the dictionary with the current key as the previous key and the current value as the previous value.
Step 3: Finally, return the dictionary.

Here's the Python code to achieve this:
"""

def tuple_to_dict(t):
    d = {t[0]: t[1]}
    for i in range(2, len(t)):
        d[t[i-1]] = t[i]
    return d

# Test the function
assert tuple_to_dict((1, 5, 7, 10, 13, 5)) == {1: 5, 7: 10, 13: 5}
print("Test Successful!")

# End
