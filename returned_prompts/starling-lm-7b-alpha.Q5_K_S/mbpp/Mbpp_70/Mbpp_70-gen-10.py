I think you forgot to compare the lengths of the tuples in your function `get_equal`. Here's a solution that should work:

```python
def get_equal(lst):
    if len(lst) < 2:
        return True
    else:
        return len(lst[0]) == len(lst[1])
```

This function first checks if the list has less than 2 elements. If it does, it means all the tuples have equal length (since there's only one tuple), so it returns True.

If the list has more than one tuple, it compares the length of the first and second tuple. If they're equal, it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

You can use this function to check if all the given tuples have equal length or not. For example, if you call `get_equal([(11, 22, 33), (44, 55, 66)])`, it will return True because both tuples have 3 elements.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.
