"""
To solve this problem, we can write a function that takes a list of tuples as input and checks if all the tuples have the same length. Here's a step-by-step guide to solving the problem:

1. Define a function called get_equal that takes a list of tuples as an argument.
2. Inside the function, initialize a variable called result and set it to True. This variable will keep track of whether all the tuples have the same length.
3. Use a for loop to iterate over each tuple in the list. For each tuple, check if its length is different from the length of the first tuple in the list. If it is, set the result variable to False and break out of the loop.
4. After the loop, check if the result variable is still True. If it is, all the tuples have the same length and the function should return True. Otherwise, return False.
5. Outside the function, use the assert statement to test the function with a sample input and expected output. If the actual output matches the expected output, the assert statement will not raise an error.

Here's the code that implements the above steps:
"""

def get_equal(lst):
    result = True
    for t in lst:
        if len(t) != len(lst[0]):
            result = False
            break
    return result

assert get_equal([(11, 22, 33), (44, 55, 66)]) == True
