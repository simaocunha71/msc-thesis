Catalan numbers are named after the Belgian mathematician EugÃ¨ne Charles Catalan. They are closely related to several topics in combinatorics and geometry, and they occur in various branches of mathematics, including algebra, combinatorial game theory, and number theory.
The first few Catalan numbers are:
1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, 429, 1430, 4862, 16796, ...
The nth Catalan number can be calculated by the formula:
C(2n) = (2n choose n) / (n+1)
where n is a non-negative integer.
The Catalan numbers can also be defined by the following recurrence relation:
C(n) = (2n-1) * C(n-1) + C(n-2) for n > 1
In this case, C(0) = 1 and C(1) = 2.

The Catalan numbers are also known as the Catalan sequences, and they can be defined by several different formulas. For example, the nth Catalan number can be calculated using the following formula:

C(n) = (4^n - 2^(n+1) + 1) / (n + 1)

However, the formula above is not the most efficient way to calculate the Catalan numbers. Instead, it is more efficient to use the recurrence relation:

C(n) = (2n-1) * C(n-1) + C(n-2)

This recurrence relation can be used to calculate the Catalan numbers in a bottom-up manner. For example, if we want to calculate the 10th Catalan number, we can use the recurrence relation to calculate the Catalan numbers
