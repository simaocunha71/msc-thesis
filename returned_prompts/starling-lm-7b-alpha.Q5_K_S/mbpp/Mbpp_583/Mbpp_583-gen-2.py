def catalan_number(n):

    else:
        return (4*catalan_number(n-1))/(n+1)
```

The function catalan_number(n) uses a recursive approach to calculate the nth Catalan number. The Catalan numbers are a sequence of natural numbers which have many interesting properties. The first few Catalan numbers are 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, ...

In the function, we check if the input value is zero. If so, we return 1 since the zero-th Catalan number is always 1. For any other input, we use the Catalan number formula to calculate the result, which is (4 times the (n-1)th Catalan number) divided by (n+1). 

Finally, we use the assert statement to check if the function is correctly calculating the 10th Catalan number, which is 16796. 

Overall, this function provides a simple and efficient way to calculate the nth Catalan number using recursion.

# Python Code:
def catalan_number(n):
    if n==0:
        return 1
    else:
        return (4*catalan_number(n-1))/(n+1)

# Test
assert catalan_number(10)==16796
```

This Python code defines a function called `catalan_number` that calculates the nth Catalan number. It uses a recursive approach, checking if the input value is zero and returning 1 if it is. Otherwise, it uses the Catalan number formula to calculate the result. The function is then tested using an assert statement to verify that it correctly calculates the 10th Catalan number, which is 16796.

By using this function, you can easily calculate any Catalan number by providing the desired index as an argument.

Here are some additional notes on the code:

- The `catalan_number` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth Catalan number.
- The function uses a recursive approach to calculate
