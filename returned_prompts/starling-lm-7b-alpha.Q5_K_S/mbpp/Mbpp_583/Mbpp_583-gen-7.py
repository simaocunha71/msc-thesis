    elif n==0 or n==1:
        return 1
    else:
        cn = [0]*(n+1)
        cn[0] = 1
        for i in range(1,n+1):
            for j in range(i):
                cn[i] += cn[j]*cn[i-1-j]
        return cn[n]
```

The above Python function calculates the nth Catalan number. The Catalan numbers are a sequence of natural numbers that have many applications in combinatorics and mathematics. They are defined by the formula:

cn = (2n)! / (n+1)!n!

The function works by first initializing an array of size n+1 with all elements set to 0. It then sets the first element to 1, as the Catalan number at index 0 is always 1. 

Next, it uses two nested loops to calculate the Catalan number at each index i. The outer loop iterates over each index from 1 to n, while the inner loop iterates over each index from 0 to i-1. 

Inside the inner loop, it calculates the product of the Catalan number at index j and the Catalan number at index i-1-j. This product is added to the Catalan number at index i. 

Finally, the function returns the Catalan number at index n, which is the nth Catalan number. 

The assert statement at the beginning of the function is used to verify that the function correctly calculates the 10th Catalan number, which is known to be 16796. 

Overall, this function provides a concise and efficient way to calculate the nth Catalan number in Python.

Here are some additional details regarding the implementation:

- The function uses dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations. It initializes an array called `cn` of size `n+1` with all elements set to 0. This array is used to store the calculated Catalan numbers at each index. 

- The first element of the array, `cn[
