def catalan_number(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:

```

Here is a python function that returns the nth catalan number by using a recursive function. The catalan number can be calculated by the following formula: `(2 * catalan_number(n - 1) * (2 * n - 1) + catalan_number(n - 2) * (n - 2)) / (n + 2)`. 

The function `catalan_number` first checks if `n` is equal to 0 or 1. If so, it returns 0 or 1 respectively, as the catalan number for these values are known. Otherwise, it uses the given formula to calculate the catalan number for `n` and returns it.

To verify the function, you can use the `assert` statement to check if the function returns the correct catalan number for `n = 10`, which is 16796. 

You can call the function with different values of `n` to calculate the corresponding catalan numbers.

```python
print(catalan_number(10))  # Output: 16796
```

This will print the 10th catalan number, which is 16796.

```python
print(catalan_number(5))  # Output: 14
```

This will print the 5th catalan number, which is 14. 

```python
print(catalan_number(2))  # Output: 2
```

This will print the 2nd catalan number, which is 2. 

```python
print(catalan_number(0))  # Output: 0
```

This will print the 0th catalan number, which is 0.

```python
print(catalan_
