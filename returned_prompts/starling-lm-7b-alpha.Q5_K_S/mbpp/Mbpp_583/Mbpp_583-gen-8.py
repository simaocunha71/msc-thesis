# Catalan numbers are defined by the formula: 
# catalan_number(n) = (2n)! / ((n+1)!*n!)
def catalan_number(n):
    return factorial(2*n)/(factorial(n+1)*factorial(n))

def factorial(n):
    if(n==0 or n==1):
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
```

It is important to note that in python, the factorial function will raise an error if you try to calculate the factorial of a non-integer number, so ensure that n is an integer.

To validate the function, you can use the following code:
```
print(catalan_number(10)==16796)
```

This will print True if the function is working correctly, and False if it is not.

Here is an alternative function which uses the identity:
```
def catalan_number(n):
    return (2*(n+1)**2 - 1) / (n+2)
```

This function is more efficient in terms of time complexity, as the factorial function is notorious for being slow.

```
assert catalan_number(10)==16796
```

The above assertion will pass if the function is working correctly.

Note that this function is defined for all non-negative integers, whereas the first function is only defined for n>=0.

In addition, both functions return a floating point number, which may lead to inaccuracies in some cases. If you need an integer result, you can use `round` to round the result to the nearest integer:
```python
catalan_number(n) = round(catalan_number(n))
```

This will ensure that the result is always an integer, but note that this may lead to inaccuracies in some cases.

To validate this function, you can use the following code:
```python
print(catalan_number(10)==16796)
```

This will print True if the function is working correctly, and False if it is
