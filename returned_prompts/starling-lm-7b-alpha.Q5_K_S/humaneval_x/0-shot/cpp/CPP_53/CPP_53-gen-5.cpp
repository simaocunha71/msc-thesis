In this code, the add function is defined to take two integer parameters x and y. Inside the function, a condition check is performed to ensure that both x and y are greater than zero. If either of them is less than or equal to zero, an error message is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, the sum of x and y is calculated and returned.

In the main function, two integer variables a and b are declared and assigned values from user input using scanf. The add function is then called with a and b as arguments, and the result is printed using printf.

This code demonstrates a basic addition operation between two integers and handles invalid input gracefully.
