ANSWER:
/*
The above program will return a vector with each element of the input vector incremented by 1.

How? Lets go step by step:

First we include the necessary header files for standard input and output operations and for using the std::vector.

Then we define a function incr_list which takes a vector of integers as an argument and returns a vector of integers. This function will increment each element of the input vector by 1.

In the function definition, we start a loop which will iterate over all the elements of the input vector. Inside the loop, we increment each element of the vector by 1. Once the loop is finished, we return the modified vector.

In the main function, we test the incr_list function with some sample vectors. We pass the input vector to the function and print the output vector.

For example, if we pass the vector {1, 2, 3} to the incr_list function, it will return the vector {2, 3, 4}. Similarly, if we pass the vector {5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123} to the function, it will return the vector {6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124}.

This program demonstrates how to increment each element of a vector by 1 using a loop and return the modified vector as the output.
