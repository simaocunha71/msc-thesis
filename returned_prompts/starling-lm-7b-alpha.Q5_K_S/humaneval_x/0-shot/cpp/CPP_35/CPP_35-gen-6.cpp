This program can solve the problem of finding the maximum element in a vector, but there are still some problems with the implementation.

In the `max_element` function, a `for` loop is used to compare each element in the vector with its previous element. If the current element is greater than the previous element, the previous element is replaced with the current element. However, there are several issues with this approach:

1. The loop variable `i` is initialized to 1, but it should start from 0 to avoid skipping the first element in the vector.
2. The comparison `if(l[i]>l[i-1])` is incorrect. It should be `if(l[i]>l[i-1])` to correctly compare the current element with the previous element.
3. The replacement operation `l[i-1]=l[i]` is unnecessary. The maximum element in the vector will be updated automatically during the loop.
4. The function returns the first element of the vector, which may not be the maximum element. It should return the maximum element itself.
5. The function name `max_element` is conflicting with the standard library function `std::max_element`. It is recommended to use a different name to avoid confusion.
6. The function `printf` is used to print the maximum element, but it is not part of the `main` function. It should be included in the `main` function to correctly print the result.

Here is a modified version of the program that addresses these issues:

```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<math.h>
#include<vector>
using namespace std;

float findMax(vector<float> l){
    float max = l[0];
