/*
Create a function that takes a string representing a number and
returns the string representation of the closest integer to it.

Examples
>>> closest_integer("10")
"10"
>>> closest_integer("15.3")
"15"

Note:
Rounding away from zero means that if the given number is equidistant
from two integers, the one you should return is the one that is the
farthest from zero. For example closest_integer("14.5") should
return "15" and closest_integer("-14.5") should return "-15".

ANSWER:
In the code, the function closest_integer is defined to take a string representing a number and return the string representation of the closest integer to it. The function first converts the input string to a double using stod and then rounds it down to the nearest integer using the floor function. If the difference between the original number and the rounded number is less than or equal to the difference between the rounded number and the next integer, the original number is returned. Otherwise, the next integer is returned as a string using to_string.

To test the function, you can use the print statement to print the result of the function closest_integer with different inputs. For example, closest_integer("10") will return "10" and closest_integer("15.3") will return "15". 

The code also includes a note explaining that rounding away from zero means that if the given number is equidistant from two integers, the one you should return is the one that is the farthest from zero. This is illustrated in the examples closest_integer("14.5") should return "15" and closest_integer("-14
