Answer & Discussion:

/*
In the above program, the value is converted to an integer by the stringstream object ss. The integer is then compared to 10. If the number is greater than or equal to 5, it is rounded up by adding 10 to the modulus of the number and subtracting the modulus of the number. Otherwise, it is rounded down by subtracting the modulus of the number from the number.

The modulus operator returns the remainder of the division of the number by 10. For example, the modulus of 17 is 7 because 7 is the remainder when 17 is divided by 10.

The modulus of 15 is 5 because 5 is the remainder when 15 is divided by 10. However, the modulus of 14 is 4 because 4 is the remainder when 14 is divided by 10. Since 5 is greater than 4, 15 is rounded up to 20.

Note that the modulus operator is not the same as the remainder operator. The remainder operator returns the remainder of the division of the number by the divisor, while the modulus operator returns the remainder of the division of the number by 10.

The modulus operator is used to round the number because it is the remainder of the division of the number by 10. The remainder of the division of the number by 10 is the digit at the end of the number, and this digit is used to round the number.

For example, the modulus of 17 is 7 because 7 is the remainder when 17 is divided by 10. However, the modulus of 14 is 4 because 4 is the remainder when 14 is divided by 10. Since 7 is greater than 4, 17 is rounded up to 20.

The modulus operator is used to round the number because it is the remainder of the division of the number by 10. The remainder of the division of the number by
