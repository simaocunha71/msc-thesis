Answer:
/*
Concatenate vector of strings into a single string
>>> concatenate({})
""
>>> concatenate({"a", "b", "c"})
"abc"
*/
#include<stdio.h>
#include<vector>
#include<string>
using namespace std;
string concatenate(vector<string> strings){

    if(strings.size()==0){
        return "";
    }
    string s = strings[0];
    for(int i=1; i<strings.size(); i++){
        s += strings[i];
    }
    return s;
}

Explanation:
This is a fairly straightforward problem. It requires you to create a function that concatenates all of the strings in a vector into a single string. 

This program begins by initializing a vector of strings. It then initializes an empty string called `s`. Next, it checks if the vector is empty. If the vector is empty, it returns the empty string. 

If the vector is not empty, it takes the first string in the vector and assigns it to `s`. Then, it loops through the rest of the strings in the vector and appends them to the end of `s`. After the loop finishes, it returns the concatenated string `s`. 

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of strings in the vector. This is because the function has to iterate through each string in the vector once to concatenate them. 

The space complexity of this function is O(1), because the function uses a constant amount of space to store the result.

This function is a good example of a simple concatenation function that can be used to concatenate a vector of strings into a single string.

Here's an example usage of the function:

```
vector<string> strings = {"Hello", "world", "!"};
string concatenatedString = concatenate
