The function `search()` you provided is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem. Here's a correct implementation:

```c++
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
using namespace std;

int search(vector<int> lst) {
    int n = lst.size();
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < n - i; j++) {
            if (lst[j] == lst[j + i]) count++;
        }
        if (count >= i) return i;
    }
    return -1;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> lst = {4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1};
    cout << search(lst) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a function `search()` that takes a vector of integers as input and returns the greatest integer that appears at least as many times as the integer itself. If no such integer exists, it returns -1.

The function uses a nested loop to compare each integer in the vector with the subsequent integers. It keeps track of the count of occurrences of each integer and compares it with the current integer. If the count is greater than or equal to the current integer, it returns the current integer. If no such integer is found, it returns -1.

The `main()` function demonstrates how to use the `search()` function by passing a sample vector of integers and printing the result.
