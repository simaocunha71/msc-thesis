Here is a code sample that demonstrates how to add two numbers using the Add function:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println(Add(2, 3))
    fmt.Println(Add(5, 7))
}

func Add(x int, y int) int {
    return x + y
}
```

When you run this code, it will output the following:

```
5
12
```

The Add function takes two integer parameters, x and y, and returns their sum. In the main function, we call the Add function with different values and print the result using the fmt.Println function from the fmt package.

To use the Add function in your own code, you can simply copy and paste the provided code into your project. Then, you can call the Add function with your desired values to perform addition operations.

It's worth noting that the Add function is defined within the main package, so you don't need to import any additional packages to use it.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.
