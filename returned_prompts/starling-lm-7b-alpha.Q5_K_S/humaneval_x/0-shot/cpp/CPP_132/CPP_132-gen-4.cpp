Ans:
Here's the Python code for the solution:

```python
def is_nested(s):
    count = 0
    for c in s:
        if c == '[':
            count += 1
        elif c == ']':
            count -= 1
        if count < 0:
            return True
    return count == 0
```

Explanation:
The function `is_nested` takes a string `s` as input and initializes a variable `count` to 0. It then iterates over each character `c` in the string. If `c` is an opening bracket `[`, the `count` variable is incremented by 1. If `c` is a closing bracket `]`, the `count` variable is decremented by 1. If at any point the `count` variable becomes negative, it means that there is at least one bracket that is nested, and the function returns True. After iterating over all the characters in the string, if the `count` variable is equal to 0, it means that all the brackets are balanced and there are no nested brackets, and the function returns False.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because it iterates over each character in the string once. The space complexity is O(1), because it only uses a single variable `count`.

Note: The solution assumes that the input string only contains square brackets and is not empty. If the input string can be empty
