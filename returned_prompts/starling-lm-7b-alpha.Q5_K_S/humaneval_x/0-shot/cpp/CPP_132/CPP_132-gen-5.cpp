To solve this problem, we can use a simple algorithm to check if there are any nested square brackets in the given string. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. Initialize a variable `i` to 0, which represents the current index of the string.
2. Use a `while` loop to iterate through the string until `i` reaches the end.
3. Inside the loop, check if the character at index `i` is an opening square bracket '['. If not, move to the next character by incrementing `i`.
4. If the character is an opening square bracket, initialize a variable `j` to `i`. This variable will help us keep track of the index of the closing square bracket that corresponds to the opening bracket at `i`.
5. Enter another `while` loop to iterate until the character at index `j` is a closing square bracket ']'. Increment `j` to move to the next character.
6. Inside this inner loop, check if the character at index `i+1` is an opening square bracket '['. If it is, return `true` immediately, as this means there is at least one nested square bracket in the string.
7. If the inner loop finishes without finding a nested square
