ANSWER:
No

Explanation:
The code defines a function `count_upper` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the number of uppercase vowels in even indices of the string. The function iterates over the string and checks if the index is even and if the character at that index is an uppercase vowel. If both conditions are true, the counter `cnt` is incremented. Finally, the function returns the value of `cnt`.

In the `main` function, the user is prompted to enter a string `s` and the `count_upper` function is called with `s` as the argument. The returned value is then printed to the console using `printf`.

The solution correctly defines the function `count_upper` and uses it to calculate and print the number of uppercase vowels in even indices of the input string.
