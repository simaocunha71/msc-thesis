ANSWER:
/*
This function takes a vector l and returns a vector l' such that
l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

The function starts by iterating over each element in the vector l using a for loop. If the index of the current element is divisible by three and the current element is not zero, then the current element is temporarily stored in a variable called temp. The function then sorts the entire vector l using the sort function from the algorithm library. Finally, the temporary variable temp is assigned back to the current element in the vector l.

In the end, the function returns the modified vector l, which now has the sorted values at the indices that are divisible by three, while keeping the other values unchanged.

Explanation of the code:
1. The function takes a vector l as a parameter and returns a vector l' as the result.
2. It starts by using a for loop to iterate over each element in the vector l.
3. Inside the loop, it checks if the index of the current element is divisible by three using the modulo operator (%). If it is, it proceeds to the next step.
4. It then checks if the current element is not zero. If it is not, it stores the current element in a temporary variable called temp.
5. After that, it sorts the entire vector l using the sort function from the algorithm library.
6. Finally, it assigns the temporary variable temp back to the current element in the vector l, effectively replacing the sorted value with the original value if the index is divisible by three and the value is not zero.
7. The function then returns the modified vector l, which now has the sorted values at the indices that are divisible by three, while keeping the other values unchanged.
