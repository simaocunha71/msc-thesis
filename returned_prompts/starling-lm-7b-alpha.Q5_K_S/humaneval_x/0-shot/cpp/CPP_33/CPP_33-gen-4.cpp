Answer: A
Explanation: A
The function takes in a vector and returns a vector which is identical to the original vector, except for the elements that are at a position which is divisible by 3.
For those positions, the elements are sorted.

Here's an explanation of the code:

We define a function called sort_third that takes in a vector of integers called l.
Inside the function, we use a range-based for loop to iterate over each element in the vector l.
For each element, we check if it is divisible by 3 using the modulo operator (%). If it is divisible by 3, we sort the entire vector using the sort function from the algorithm library.
Finally, we return the sorted vector.

The time complexity of this function is O(n log n) where n is the number of elements in the vector, because sorting the vector takes O(n log n) time.
The space complexity is O(1) because we are not using any extra space that scales with the size of the input.

This function can be useful in situations where you want to maintain the original order of elements in a vector, but need to sort specific elements that are at positions divisible by 3.

Here are some test cases to demonstrate the function:

When we call sort_third({1, 2, 3}), the function should return {1, 2, 3} because none of the elements are divisible by 3, so no sorting is necessary.
When we call sort_third({5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2}), the function should return {2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5} because the 3rd and 6th elements are divisible by 3, so they should be sorted to their correct positions.
