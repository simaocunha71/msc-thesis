/*
In the above program,

1) We define a function below_zero that takes a vector of deposit and withdrawal operations as a parameter.
2) Inside the function, we initialize a balance variable to zero.
3) We traverse the vector using a for loop. For every operation, we add the operation value to the balance.
4) If at any point, the balance becomes less than zero, we return true.
5) If we have gone through all the operations and the balance is still non-negative, we return false.
