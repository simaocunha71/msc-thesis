In this program, the function sum_squares() takes a vector of integers as an argument and performs specific operations on its entries based on their indices. Here's a detailed explanation of the code:

1. The function sum_squares() initializes a variable called "result" to 0. This variable will store the sum of the modified entries in the vector.

2. Using a for loop, the function iterates through each entry in the vector. The loop runs from i = 0 to i < lst.size().

3. Inside the loop, the function checks if the index i is a multiple of 3 using the condition i % 3 == 0. If it is, the function squares the entry by multiplying it by itself (lst[i] = lst[i] * lst[i]).

4. Next, the function checks if the index i is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3 using the condition i % 4 == 0 && i % 3 != 0. If both conditions are true, the function cubes the entry by multiplying it by itself twice (lst[i] = lst[i] * lst[i] * lst[i]).

5. After performing the necessary operations on the entry, the function adds its value to the "result" variable.

6. Once the loop is finished, the function returns the final value of
