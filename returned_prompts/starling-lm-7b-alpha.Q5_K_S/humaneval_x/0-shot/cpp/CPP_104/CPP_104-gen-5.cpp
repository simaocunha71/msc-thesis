Here is a Python version of the solution:

```python
def unique_digits(x):
    # create an empty list to store the numbers that don't have even digits
    v = []
    # iterate through the list of numbers
    for n in x:
        # check if the number has an even digit
        if not has_even_digits(n):
            # if the number doesn't have even digits, append it to the list
            v.append(n)
    # sort the list in ascending order
    v.sort()
    # return the sorted list
    return v

def has_even_digits(n):
    # while the number is greater than 0
    while n > 0:
        # check if the last digit of the number is even
        if n % 10 % 2 == 0:
            # if the last digit is even, return True
            return True
        # otherwise, remove the last digit from the number
        n /= 10
    # if the number has no even digits, return False
    return False
```

This Python implementation works the same way as the C++ implementation. It iterates through the input list of numbers and checks if each number has an even digit. If a number doesn't have an even digit, it is appended to a separate list. Once the iteration is complete, the separate list is sorted in ascending order and returned as the result.

The `has_even_digits` function is a helper function that checks if a number has an even digit. It does this by repeatedly dividing the number by 10 until it becomes 0
