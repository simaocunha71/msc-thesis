In the code, the function remove_vowels takes a string as an argument and returns a string without vowels. The function uses the remove function to erase all occurrences of 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u' from the string. The function then returns the modified string.

To test the function, the main function calls remove_vowels with different inputs and prints the result using the printf function. The expected output is shown in the comments next to each printf statement.

For example, the first test case "abcdef\nghijklm" is passed to the remove_vowels function and the modified string "bcdf\nghjklm" is printed. The next test case "aaBAA" is passed to the function and the modified string "B" is printed. The last test case "zbcd" is passed to the function and the modified string "zbcd" is printed.

Overall, the code defines the remove_vowels function and tests it with different inputs to verify its correctness.
