    vector<int> arr;
    while(a<=b){
        int temp = a;
        while(temp>0){
            int digit = temp%10;
            if(digit%2==0){
                arr.push_back(digit);
            }
            temp = temp/10;

    return 0;
}

Explanation:
This is a correct solution. It defines the function generate_integers that takes two integers a and b as parameters and returns a vector of even digits between a and b. It initializes an empty vector arr. Then, it enters a while loop that continues until a is greater than b. Inside the while loop, a temporary variable temp is assigned the value of a. Another while loop is entered which continues until temp becomes 0. Inside this while loop, the last digit of temp is stored in a variable digit. If the digit is even (i.e. divisible by 2), it is added to the vector arr. Then, temp is divided by 10 to remove the last digit. After the while loop, a is incremented by 1. The while loop repeats until a is greater than b. Finally, the function returns the vector arr. In the main function, the function generate_integers is called with parameters 2 and 8.
