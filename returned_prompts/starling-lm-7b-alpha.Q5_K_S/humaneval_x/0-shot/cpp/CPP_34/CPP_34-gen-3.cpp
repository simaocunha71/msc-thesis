The above code uses the 'std::sort' function to sort the vector in ascending order. Then it iterates through the vector and checks if the current element is different from the previous one. If it is, it adds the element to the result vector. This ensures that only unique elements are added to the result vector. Finally, the function returns the result vector.

In the main function, a vector 'a' is created with some random elements. The 'unique' function is then called with 'a' as the argument, and the result is stored in vector 'b'. Finally, the elements of 'b' are printed using a loop.

Note: The code provided is in C++, as indicated by the use of the 'std::vector' and 'std::sort' functions.

Here's an equivalent implementation in Python:

```python
def unique(l):
    l.sort()
    ret = []
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if i == 0 or l[i] != l[i-1]:
            ret.append(l[i])
    return ret

a = [5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]
b = unique(a)
print(b)
```

This Python implementation uses the 'sort' method to sort the list in ascending order, and the 'append' method to add unique elements to the result list.
