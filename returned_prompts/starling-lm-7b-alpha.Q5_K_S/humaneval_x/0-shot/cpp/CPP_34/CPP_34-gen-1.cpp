In order to solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Sort the given vector `l` using the `sort` function from the `<algorithm>` library. This will arrange the elements in ascending order.
2. Initialize an empty vector `res` to store the unique elements.
3. Iterate through the sorted vector `l` using a `for` loop. For each element, compare it with the previous element (`prev`). If they are not equal, add the current element to the `res` vector and update the value of `prev` to the current element.
4. After the loop ends, the `res` vector will contain all the unique elements in sorted order.
5. Return the `res` vector as the result.

In the provided code, the `unique` function takes a vector `l` as input and performs the steps mentioned above to return the sorted unique elements. The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `unique` function by passing a sample vector `l` and printing the result.

When you run the code, it will output the sorted unique elements of the vector `l` as follows:

0 2 3 5 9 123

This means that the unique elements in the vector `l` are 0, 2, 3, 5, 9, and 123, sorted in ascending order.
