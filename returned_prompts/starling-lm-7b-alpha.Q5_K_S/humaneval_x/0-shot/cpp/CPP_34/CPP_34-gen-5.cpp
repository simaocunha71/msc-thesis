    sort(l.begin(), l.end());
B:
    l.erase(unique(l.begin(), l.end()), l.end());
C:
    return l;
}

What is the error in the above code?

Answer: There are two errors in the above code.

Explanation:

In step A, we are sorting the vector but not updating the original vector. So, the original vector is still unsorted.

In step B, we are using the erase-remove idiom to remove the duplicate elements from the vector. But the issue here is that we are not updating the original vector with the new size after removal of duplicate elements. So, the original vector still contains the duplicate elements.

In step C, we are returning the vector but it still has duplicate elements. So, the result will not be a vector with unique elements. 

To fix these issues, we need to update the original vector after sorting and after removing the duplicate elements. 

Here is the corrected code:

vector<int> unique(vector<int> l){
    sort(l.begin(), l.end());
    l.erase(unique(l.begin(), l.end()), l.end());
    return l;
}

This code will correctly sort the vector and remove the duplicate elements, returning a vector with unique elements.

In this corrected code, we first sort the vector using the sort function from the algorithm library. This updates the original vector with the sorted order of elements.

Then, we use the erase-remove idiom to remove the duplicate elements from the vector. The unique function returns an iterator pointing to the end of the range that was modified by the erase operation. We pass this iterator to the erase function to update the original vector with the new size after removal of duplicate elements.

Finally, we return the vector with unique elements.

This corrected code will correctly return a vector with unique elements in sorted order.

Note: The erase-remove idiom is a common technique to remove elements from a container in a single pass. Here, we are using it to remove duplicate elements from the vector.

The erase-remove idiom involves creating an iterator range by calling the unique function on the vector, and then passing this range to the erase function to remove the duplicate
