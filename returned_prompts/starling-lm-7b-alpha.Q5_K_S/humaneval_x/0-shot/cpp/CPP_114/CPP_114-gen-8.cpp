Here are some tips to help you improve your answer:

1. Make sure you have a clear understanding of the problem, including all the constraints and requirements. This will help you avoid overlooking any important details.
2. Break down the problem into smaller, more manageable parts. This will make it easier to find a solution and will help you avoid getting overwhelmed.
3. Be careful with edge cases. These are situations that may not occur frequently, but can cause your solution to fail. For example, if the input vector is empty, what should your function return? What if all the elements in the vector are negative?
4. Test your solution thoroughly. This includes not only testing with the provided examples, but also creating your own test cases to ensure that your function works correctly in all situations.
5. If you're stuck, take a break and come back to the problem later. Sometimes, stepping away from a problem for a while can give you a fresh perspective and help you find a solution.
6. Finally, don't be afraid to ask for help. If you're struggling with a problem, it's okay to seek advice from others. There are many online communities and forums where you can ask questions and get help from experienced programmers.

I hope these tips help you improve your answer. Good luck with your programming journey!
