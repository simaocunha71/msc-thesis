Here is a solution to the problem. The idea is to first sort the vector, and then calculate the median. If the vector has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the middle two elements; if the vector has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element.

To calculate the median, we can use the following steps:

1. Sort the vector using the sort function from the algorithm library. This will arrange the elements in ascending order.
2. Determine the size of the vector using the size function. If the size is even, we need to calculate the average of the middle two elements. If the size is odd, we need to find the middle element.
3. If the size is even, we can calculate the average of the middle two elements by summing them and dividing by 2. The index of the first middle element is (size/2)-1, and the index of the second middle element is size/2. We can access the elements of the vector using their indices.
4. If the size is odd, we can find the middle element by accessing the element at index (size/2). Again, we can use the index operator to access the element.
5. Return the calculated median as the result.
