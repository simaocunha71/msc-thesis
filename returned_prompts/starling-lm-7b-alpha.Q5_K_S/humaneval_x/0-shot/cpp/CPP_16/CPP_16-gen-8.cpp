The above code is written in C++. However, it can be rewritten in Python as follows:

def count_distinct_characters(str):
    str = sorted(str)
    len = len(str)
    count = 0
    for i in range(len):
        if i == 0 or str[i] != str[i-1]:
            count += 1
    return count

>>> count_distinct_characters("xyzXYZ")
3
>>> count_distinct_characters("Jerry")
4

In the above Python code, the function count_distinct_characters() takes a string as an argument and returns the number of distinct characters in the string. The string is sorted using the sorted() function, and then the length of the sorted string is determined. The variable count is initialized to 0. A for loop is used to iterate over the sorted string. If the current character is different from the previous character, the count is incremented by 1. Finally, the count is returned.

The function is tested with the inputs "xyzXYZ" and "Jerry", and the expected outputs of 3 and 4, respectively, are obtained.

In summary, the provided Python code is an alternative implementation of the count_distinct_characters() function in C++.
