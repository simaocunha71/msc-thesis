In the given solution, the function remove_duplicates takes a vector of integers as input and returns a vector of integers as output. It uses a vector called result to store the unique elements from the input vector. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. The function starts by declaring a vector called result and reserving memory for it with the same size as the input vector. This step helps optimize the performance of the program.

2. A for loop is used to iterate through each element in the input vector. The loop variable i is of type vector<int>::iterator, which allows us to access and manipulate the elements of the vector.

3. Inside the loop, the find function is used to check if the current element (*i) already exists in the result vector. The find function returns an iterator to the first occurrence of the element in the vector or the end iterator if the element is not found. If the element is not found (i.e., the iterator points to the end of the vector), the if condition is true.

4. If the element is not found in the result vector, it is inserted at the beginning of the result vector using the insert function. The insert function takes the iterator to the position where the element should be inserted and the element itself as arguments. By inserting the element at the beginning of the vector, we ensure that the elements in the result vector are in the same order as in the input vector
