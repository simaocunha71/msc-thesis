In this question, we can use the concept of geometry to solve it. Let's think about it:

In the given problem, we have two sets of cars, one moving from left to right and the other moving from right to left. Let's consider the two cars that are closest to each other but have not yet collided. Let's call the distance between these two cars the "diameter" of the collision circle.

In the problem, we are asked to find the number of collisions, which means the number of times when the left-moving car and the right-moving car collide with each other. We can think of this as the number of times when the "diameter" of the collision circle becomes zero.

Let's consider a left-moving car and a right-moving car. The distance between them is always decreasing. When they collide, the "diameter" of the collision circle becomes zero. After the collision, the distance between them starts increasing again.

Let's consider the left-moving car and the right-moving car that collide first. The distance between them is always decreasing, so eventually, the "diameter" of the collision circle will become zero again. However, the left-moving car and the right-moving car that collided first will not collide again because the "diameter" of the collision circle is zero.

Therefore, we can conclude that after the first collision, the left-moving car and the right-moving car that collided first will not collide again. So, the number of collisions is equal to the number of pairs of left-m
