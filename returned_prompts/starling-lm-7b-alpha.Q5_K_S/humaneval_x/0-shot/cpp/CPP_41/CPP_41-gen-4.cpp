/*
The above function is wrong.  It's actually wrong for any n.

The correct answer is this:

The function returns an infinite number.

Here's why:

The cars are moving at the same speed in opposite directions.
As time passes, the two groups of cars get closer and closer to each other.
Eventually, they will be in the same place at the same time; at that point,
all the cars in one group will collide with all the cars in the other group.

Thus, there are an infinite number of collisions, no matter how many cars are in each group.
