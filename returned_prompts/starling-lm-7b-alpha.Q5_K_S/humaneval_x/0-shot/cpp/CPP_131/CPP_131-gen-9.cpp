This program is a C++ implementation of the 'digits' function from the original C code provided. The function takes a positive integer 'n' as input and returns the product of the odd digits in 'n'. If all the digits in 'n' are even, the function returns 0.

In the main function, the program prompts the user to enter a positive integer 'n' using the scanf function. It then calls the digits function with 'n' as the argument and prints the result using the printf function.

The digits function uses recursion to calculate the product of the odd digits in 'n'. If 'n' is equal to 0, the function returns 0. If 'n' is odd, the function multiplies 'n' with the result of the digits function called with 'n' divided by 10. If 'n' is even, the function calls the digits function with 'n' divided by 10. This process continues until 'n' becomes 0, and the final result is returned.

Overall, this program efficiently calculates the product of the odd digits in a positive integer using recursion.
