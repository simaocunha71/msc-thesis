Ans: While loop is used to check the last digit of the number and the if-else condition is used to check whether the last digit is odd or even. If the last digit is odd, it will return the product of odd digits of the number. If the last digit is even, it will return 0.

Explanation:
The given code defines a function named "digits" that takes an integer "n" as an argument. Inside the function, an integer "n1" is initialized with the value of "n". The code then checks if "n" is even (i.e., equal to 0) using the modulo operator (%). If "n" is even, the function returns 0.

If "n" is not even, the code enters a while loop. Inside the loop, the code checks if the last digit of "n1" is not equal to 0. If the last digit is not 0, it checks if the last digit is odd (i.e., not equal to 0) using the modulo operator (%). If the last digit is odd, the code continues to divide "n1" by 10 and checks the next digit. This process continues until the last digit is not odd or "n1" becomes 0.

If the while loop exits without finding any odd digit, the function returns 0. Otherwise, if the while loop finds an odd digit
