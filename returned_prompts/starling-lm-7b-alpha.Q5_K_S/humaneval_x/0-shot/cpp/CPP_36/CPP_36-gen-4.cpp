    if(n==1) return 0;
    if(n%7==0) return 1+fizz_buzz(n-1);
    if(n%11==0) goto A;
    if(n%13==0) goto A;
    return fizz_buzz(n-1);
}


Answer:
Here's a Python solution for the problem:

```python
def fizz_buzz(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    if n % 7 == 0:
        return 1 + fizz_buzz(n - 1)
    if n % 11 == 0:
        return 1 + fizz_buzz(n - 1)
    if n % 13 == 0:
        return 1 + fizz_buzz(n - 1)
    return fizz_buzz(n - 1)
```

Explanation:
The function `fizz_buzz` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than `n` which are divisible by 11 or 13. 

The function uses a recursive approach to solve the problem. It checks if `n` is less than or equal to 0, in which case it returns 0. If `n` is divisible by 7, it returns 1 plus the result of the function called with `n-1`. If `n` is divisible by 11, it goes back to the start of the function and calls itself with `n-1`. If `n` is divisible by 13, it also goes back to the start of the function and calls itself with `n-1`. If none of these conditions are met, it calls the function with `n-1`. 

This recursive approach continues until `n` becomes 1, at which point the function returns 0. 

The function uses a `goto` statement in the C++ solution, but it is not necessary in Python. 

Overall, the function counts the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than `n` which are divisible by 11 or
