Here's a function that computes the n-th element of the fib4 number sequence. The function uses a while loop to iterate from 4 to n. For each iteration, it computes the next element of the sequence using the previous four elements. The function returns the n-th element of the sequence.

Here's an example of how to use the function:

int main()
{
    printf("%d\n", fib4(5));
    printf("%d\n", fib4(6));
    printf("%d\n", fib4(7));
    return 0;
}

This program will output the following:

4
8
14

These are the first few elements of the fib4 number sequence.
