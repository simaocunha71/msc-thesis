ANSWER:
True

Explanation: The vector elements are monotonically increasing because each element in the vector is larger than the previous one.

In the first example, the vector {1, 2, 4, 20} is monotonically increasing because each element is larger than the previous one. The second vector {1, 20, 4, 10} is not monotonically increasing because 20 is not larger than 4.

The third vector {4, 1, 0, -10} is monotonically increasing because each element is larger than the previous one.

To determine if a vector is monotonically increasing, you can compare each element to the previous one. If the current element is larger than the previous one, the vector is monotonically increasing. If the current element is not larger than the previous one, the vector is not monotonically increasing.

To determine if a vector is monotonically increasing, you can compare each element to the previous one. If the current element is larger than the previous one, the vector is monotonically increasing. If the current element is not larger than the previous one, the vector is not monotonically increasing.

In the provided code, the function monotonic takes a vector of floats as an argument and returns a boolean value. The function first checks if the vector size is less than 2. If the vector size is less than 2, the function returns true because there are not enough elements to determine if the vector is monotonically increasing or decreasing.

If the vector size is 2 or more, the function checks if the first element is larger than the second element. If the first element is not larger than the second element, the function returns false because the vector is not monotonically increasing.

If the first element is larger than the second element, the function enters a loop that compares each element to the previous one. If any element is not larger than the previous one, the
