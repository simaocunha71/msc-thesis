A:D

Explanation:
The function monotonic checks if the elements of the input vector are monotonically increasing or decreasing. It does this by comparing each element to the next one. If at any point an element is smaller than the previous one, the function returns false, as the sequence is not monotonically increasing. Otherwise, if the sequence is monotonically increasing, the function returns true.

In the main function, the monotonic function is called with three different vectors as arguments: {1, 2, 4, 20}, {1, 20, 4, 10}, and {4, 1, 0, -10}. The function returns true for the first vector, as the elements are monotonically increasing. It returns false for the second vector, as the elements are not monotonically increasing. It returns true for the third vector, as the elements are monotonically decreasing.

Overall, the program demonstrates how to use the monotonic function to check if the elements of a vector are monotonically increasing or decreasing.
