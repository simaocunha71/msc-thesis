This is because the `-1` is considered as a strange number, so it is ignored and we only get `{1, 55}` in the `tmp` vector.

The time complexity of the code is O(nlogn), where n is the number of elements in the original vector.

This is because the sorting part takes O(nlogn) time, and the reversing part takes O(n) time.

The space complexity is O(n), because we need to store the sorted and reversed vector, and also the map to store the names of the numbers.

The code can be optimized if we can avoid storing the sorted and reversed vector. However, in this problem, it is necessary to store the vector because we need to return it as the result.

Here is an optimized version of the code:

```cpp
vector<string> by_length(vector<int> arr){
    vector<int> tmp;
    for(int i:arr) if(i>=1 && i<=9) tmp.push_back(i);
    if(tmp.size()==0) return {};
    sort(tmp.begin
