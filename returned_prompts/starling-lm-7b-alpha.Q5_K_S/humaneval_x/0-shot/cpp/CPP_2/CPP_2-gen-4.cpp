Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. The function `truncate_number` takes a float number as an argument.
2. Inside the function, a variable `integer` is declared to store the integer part of the number.
3. The `floor` function is used to round down the number to the nearest integer. This is done by subtracting the integer part from the number itself. The result is stored in the `integer` variable.
4. The function returns the difference between the original number and the integer part, which is the decimal part of the number.
5. In the `main` function, a float variable `number` is declared to store the user input.
6. The user is prompted to enter a floating point number using the `scanf` function.
7. The `truncate_number` function is called with the `number` variable as the argument, and the result is stored in the `number` variable again.
8. The `printf` function is used to print the decimal part of the number to the console.

This code effectively decomposes a positive floating point number into its integer part and decimal part, and returns the decimal part.
