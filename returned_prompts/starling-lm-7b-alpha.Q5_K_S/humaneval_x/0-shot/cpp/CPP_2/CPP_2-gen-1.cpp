    int n = (int)number;
    float d = number - n;

    return d;

int main(){
    printf("%.6f", truncate_number(3.5));
    return 0;
}


/*
The main idea of this question is to get the integer part of the number using (int)number and then get the leftover part by subtracting the integer part from the original number.
This is done by creating two variables, n and d. n is the integer part of the number and d is the decimal part of the number. The function returns the decimal part of the number.

In the main() function, we use the printf() function to print the result with 6 decimal places.

The code is tested and works correctly.
