In the above solution, the function right_angle_triangle() checks if the given three sides form a right-angled triangle or not. It checks three conditions for a triangle to be right-angled:

- If the square of the first side is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
- If the square of the second side is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
- If the square of the third side is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

If any of the above conditions are true, the function returns true, indicating that the given sides form a right-angled triangle. Otherwise, it returns false.

In the main() function, the user is prompted to enter the values of the three sides of the triangle. These values are then passed as arguments to the right_angle_triangle() function. The function returns a boolean value (true or false), which is printed as the output.

Note: The pow() function from the math.h library is used to calculate the square of a number.

Overall, this solution effectively checks if the given sides can form a right-angled triangle or not, based on the Pythagorean theorem.
