Here is a detailed explanation of the code:

1. The function double_the_difference takes a vector of floats as input and returns a long long int as output.
2. It initializes a variable sum to 0, which will store the sum of squares of the odd numbers in the input vector.
3. The function uses a for loop to iterate through each element in the input vector.
4. Inside the loop, it checks if the current element is odd (lst[i]%2 != 0) and greater than 0 (lst[i] > 0). If both conditions are true, it squares the element (lst[i] * lst[i]) and adds it to the sum variable.
5. After iterating through all the elements in the input vector, the function returns the final value of the sum variable.
6. In the main function, a vector arr is initialized with the values {1,3,2,0}. This vector is then passed as an argument to the double_the_difference function, and the returned value is printed using the printf function.

The provided code correctly solves the problem of calculating the sum of squares of odd numbers in a vector that are also non-negative.

To test the code, you can modify the values in the vector arr in the main function and observe the output. For example, if you change arr to {9, -2}, the output will be 81, as the only odd number in the vector is 9, and its square is 81.

It's important to note that the code assumes that the input vector does not contain negative numbers and non-integer values. If the input vector can
