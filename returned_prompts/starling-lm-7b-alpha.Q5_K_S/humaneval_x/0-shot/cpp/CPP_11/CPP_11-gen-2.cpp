The code you provided defines a function `string_xor` that takes two strings `a` and `b` as input and performs binary XOR on them. The function uses a `while` loop to iterate through the characters of the input strings. Inside the loop, it compares each character at the same index in `a` and `b`. If the characters are equal, it appends a '0' to the result string `c`, otherwise it appends a '1'. Finally, the function returns the resulting string `c`.

To use this function, you can call it with two strings as arguments, like this:

```
string result = string_xor("010", "110");
```

In this example, the function will perform binary XOR on the strings "010" and "110" and return the result as a string. The result will be "100", which represents the binary XOR of the corresponding characters in the input strings.

Here's the modified code with the correct function signature and usage:

```c++
#include<string>
#include<iostream>

std::string string_xor(std::string a, std::string b){
    int i=0;
    int n=a.length();
    std::string c;
    while(i<n){
        if(a[i]==b[i])
            c.push_back('0');
        else
            c.push_back('1');
        i++;
    }
    return c;
}

int main(){
    std::string result = string_xor("010", "110");
    std::cout << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
