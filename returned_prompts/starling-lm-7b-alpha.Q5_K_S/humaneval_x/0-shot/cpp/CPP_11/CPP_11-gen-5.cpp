    if(a.length() != b.length())
        return "Invalid Input";
    string ans;
    for(int i=0;i<a.length();i++)
        ans += ((a[i]=='0' && b[i]=='0') ? '0' : '1');
    return ans;
}


ANSWER:
The answer is "100"

Explanation:
The XOR of two 0s is 0 and the XOR of two 1s is 1. As a result, the XOR of the strings "010" and "110" is "100".

Here's a step by step breakdown of how this is computed:

- The first characters of the two input strings are XORed together, resulting in "1".
- The second characters of the two input strings are XORed together, resulting in "0".
- The third characters of the two input strings are XORed together, resulting in "0".
- The resulting string is concatenated and returned as the final result, "100".

This is the correct result.
