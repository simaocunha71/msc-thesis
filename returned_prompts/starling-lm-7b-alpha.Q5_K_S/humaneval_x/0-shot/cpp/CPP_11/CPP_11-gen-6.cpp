The provided code does not actually implement the functionality described in the docstring. Here is a possible implementation:

```python
def x_or_y(n, x, y):
    if is_prime(n):
        return x
    else:
        return y
```

To use this function, you need to define the `is_prime` function, which should return `True` if the number is prime and `False` otherwise. Here is a simple way to determine if a number is prime:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

Please note that the `is_prime` function is not optimal and may not be suitable for large numbers.

Here's a test of the `x_or_y` function:

```python
def test_x_or_y():
    assert x_or_y(7, 34, 12) == 34
    assert x_or_y(15, 8, 5) == 5
    assert x_or_y(2, 34, 12) == 12
    assert x_or_y(3, 34, 12) == 34

test_x_or_y()
```

You can run these tests to check if your implementation is correct.

In addition, the provided code does not contain any documentation. Here's an example of how you can add documentation to the function:

```python
def x_or_y(n, x, y):
    """
    A simple program which should return the value of `x` if `n` is
    a prime number and should return the value of `y` otherwise.

    :param n: The number to check if it's prime.
    :param x: The value to return if `n` is prime.
    :param y: The value to return if `n` is not prime.
    :return: The value of `x` if `n` is prime
