Answer :

In Python, you can define a function that takes two integers as parameters and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) using recursion. Here's an example implementation:

```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return greatest_common_divisor(b, a % b)
```

To use this function, you can call it with two integers as arguments. For example, `greatest_common_divisor(3, 5)` will return `1`, and `greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)` will return `5`.

In the implementation, the function uses recursion to repeatedly divide the larger number by the smaller number until the remainder becomes zero. At that point, the function returns the last non-zero remainder, which is the GCD of the two input numbers.

By using recursion, the function can handle any positive integers as input, and it will always terminate and return the correct result.

Here are some test cases you can use to verify the function's correctness:

```python
print(greatest_common_divisor(3, 5))  # Output: 1
print(greatest_common_divisor(25, 15))  # Output: 5
```

These test cases demonstrate that the function correctly calculates the GCD for different pairs of integers.

Overall, this implementation provides a clear and concise
