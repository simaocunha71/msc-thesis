The function is_multiply_prime(int a) checks if the given number a is the multiplication of three prime numbers. It returns true if a is a prime number itself, or if a is divisible by exactly one, two or three prime numbers. Otherwise, it returns false.

The function uses a for loop to iterate from 2 to a-1. It checks if a is divisible by any number i in this range. If a is divisible by i, it checks if i is a prime number itself. If i is a prime number, it returns true. If i is not a prime number, it returns false.

If the number a is less than 100, the function checks if a is divisible by exactly one, two or three prime numbers. If a is divisible by exactly one, two or three prime numbers, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

If the number a is greater than or equal to 100, the function returns false, as the maximum limit of the for loop is a-1, which is less than 100.

The main function calls the is_multiply_prime function with the number 30 and prints the result.

In this case, the result is true, as 30 is the multiplication of the prime numbers 2, 3 and 5.
