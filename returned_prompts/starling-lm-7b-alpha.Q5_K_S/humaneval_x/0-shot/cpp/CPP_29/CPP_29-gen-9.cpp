/*
The function filter_by_prefix(strings, prefix) takes a vector of strings and a string prefix and filters
the strings in the vector to only include ones that start with the given prefix. The function uses a for
loop to iterate over each string in the vector. For each string, it compares the first prefix.size() characters
of the string with the prefix string using the compare() function. If the first characters of the string and prefix
are the same, the string is added to the result vector using the push_back() function. Finally, the function returns
the result vector.

In the test cases, filter_by_prefix({}, "a") returns an empty vector, because there are no strings in the input vector
to filter. filter_by_prefix({"abc", "bcd", "cde", "vector"}, "a") returns a vector containing "abc" and "vector",
because these are the only strings in the input vector that start with the letter "a".
