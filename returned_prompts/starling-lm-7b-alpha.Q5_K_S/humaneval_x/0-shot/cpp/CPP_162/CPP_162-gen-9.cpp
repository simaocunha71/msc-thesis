The code you provided is a C++ implementation of a function that takes a string as input and returns its MD5 hash equivalent string. The function first checks if the input string is empty, and if so, it returns an empty string. Otherwise, it initializes an MD5_CTX object and proceeds to update and finalize the MD5 hash. The resulting hash is then converted to a string format and returned.

To use this function, you can follow the example provided in the code comments:

>>> string_to_md5("Hello world") == "3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62"

In this case, the function is called with the string "Hello world" as an argument, and it returns the MD5 hash equivalent string "3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62".

Note that this implementation uses the OpenSSL library, which provides cryptographic functionality including MD5 hashing. Make sure you have the OpenSSL library installed and included in your project before using this code.

Overall, this function is useful for generating MD5 hash equivalents of strings, which can be helpful in various applications such as password hashing, data integrity checks, or digital signatures.

Here's a breakdown of the steps in the function:

1. Check if the input string is empty. If so, return an empty string.
2. Initialize an MD5_CTX object, which is a structure used for MD5 hashing in OpenSSL.
