In the above code, a string named `binary` is declared with the initial value "db". Then, a while loop is used to calculate the binary equivalent of the decimal number `decimal`. The while loop continues until the decimal is no longer greater than 0. Within the while loop, the remainder of the division between `decimal` and 2 is calculated. This remainder is then added to the `binary` string as a character. The decimal is then divided by 2 to prepare for the next iteration. Once the while loop is complete, the string `binary` is appended with "db". Finally, the `binary` string is returned by the function.

In the `main` function, an integer `a` is declared and assigned the value entered by the user. The `decimal_to_binary` function is then called with `a` as the argument, and the result is printed to the console using `printf`. The `c_str` method is used to convert the string `binary` to a C-style string, which can be printed using `printf`.

This code converts a decimal number to its binary representation, with the extra "db" characters at the beginning and end of the string to help with the format.
