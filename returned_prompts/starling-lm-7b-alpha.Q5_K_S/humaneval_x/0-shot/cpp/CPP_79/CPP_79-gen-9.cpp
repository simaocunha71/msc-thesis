The function decimal_to_binary takes a number in decimal form and converts it to binary format. The function returns a string where each character represents a binary number, either '0' or '1'. The string also includes extra characters "db" at the beginning and at the end to help with the format.

Here's how the function works:

1. It defines a string variable called "binary" to store the binary representation of the decimal number.
2. It initializes an integer variable called "temp" with the value of the decimal number.
3. It enters a while loop that continues until the value of "temp" becomes 0.
4. Inside the while loop, it converts the remainder of "temp" divided by 2 (i.e., the last digit of the binary representation) to a string and concatenates it to the left of the existing binary representation stored in "binary".
5. It updates the value of "temp" by dividing it by 2, effectively moving to the next digit in the binary representation.
6. After the while loop completes, it concatenates "db" to the left and right of the binary representation stored in "binary" to match the desired format.
7. Finally, it returns the binary representation as a string.

In the given example, the function is called with the decimal number 15. The function converts 15 to binary (1111 in decimal), adds the "db" characters to the beginning and end, and returns the result "db1111db".

To verify the result, the main function prints the returned binary representation using printf and the "%s" format specifier.

Overall, the function successfully converts a decimal number to its binary representation
