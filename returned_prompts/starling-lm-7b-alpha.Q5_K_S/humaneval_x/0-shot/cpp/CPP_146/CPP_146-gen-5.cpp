This is a C++ program that defines a function called `specialFilter` that takes a vector of numbers as input and returns the number of elements in the vector that are greater than 10 and both the first and last digits of a number are odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).

The function first initializes a variable `n` to 0, which will be used to keep track of the number of elements that meet the criteria. Then, it enters a loop that iterates over each element in the input vector.

Inside the loop, the function checks if the current element `x` is greater than 10. If it is, the function then checks if `x` is odd by using the modulo operator `%` to check if the remainder of `x` divided by 2 is not equal to 0. If `x` is odd, the function enters another loop to check the first and last digits of `x`.

In the inner loop, the function assigns the current value of `x` to a new variable `y` and then repeatedly divides `y` by 10 until it becomes 0. This
