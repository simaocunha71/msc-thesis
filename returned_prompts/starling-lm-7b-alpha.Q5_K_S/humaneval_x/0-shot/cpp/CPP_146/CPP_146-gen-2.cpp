Answer:
The function first defines a counter variable and sets it to zero. Then, it iterates through each number in the vector and checks if the first and last digits of the number are both odd. If they are, it increments the counter. After iterating through all the numbers, the function returns the counter value. In the main function, a vector of numbers is created and passed to the specialFilter function. The result is printed to the console.

Explanation:
The provided solution uses a for loop to iterate through each number in the vector. Inside the loop, the first and last digits of the number are extracted using integer division and modulus operations. If either the first or last digit is even, the loop continues to the next number. If both the first and last digits are odd, the counter is incremented. After all numbers have been processed, the function returns the counter value. In the main function, a vector of numbers is created and passed to the specialFilter function. The result is printed to the console using the printf function.

Note: The solution uses a continue statement to skip to the next iteration of the loop if the first or last digit is even. This allows the loop to efficiently process only the numbers with both odd first and last digits.

Overall, the solution correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and provides an efficient way to filter the numbers based on the given conditions.
