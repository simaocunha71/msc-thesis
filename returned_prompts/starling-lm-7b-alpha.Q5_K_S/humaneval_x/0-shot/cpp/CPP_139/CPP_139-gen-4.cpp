Explanation:
To solve this problem, we need to understand what the Brazilian factorial is. The Brazilian factorial is defined as the product of all positive integers less than or equal to a given number. In other words, it is the factorial of a factorial. 

For example, the Brazilian factorial of 4 is 4! * 3! * 2! * 1! = 288. 

To calculate the Brazilian factorial, we can use
