# Explanation:
# The Brazilian factorial is a simple factorial with an additional multiplication by all integers from the original number down to 1.

# To calculate the Brazilian factorial of a number, we can use the standard factorial function and multiply it by the factorial of all the numbers down to 1. In Python, we can use the `math` library's `factorial` function to calculate the factorial of a number.

# We initialize the result variable to 1. Then, we use a for loop to iterate from the given number `n` down to 1. In each iteration, we multiply the current number by the result. After the loop finishes, we return the result, which is the Brazilian factorial of the original number.

# For example, if we call `special_factorial(4)`, the function will calculate `4!`, which is equal to `4 * 3 * 2 * 1`, and then multiply it by `3!` (which is equal to `3 * 2 * 1`), `2!` (which is equal to `2 * 1`), and `1!` (which is equal to `1`). The result will be `288`.

# Here's an example of how you can use the `special_factorial` function in your Python code:

# ```
# result = special_factorial(4)
# print(result)  # Output: 288
# ```
