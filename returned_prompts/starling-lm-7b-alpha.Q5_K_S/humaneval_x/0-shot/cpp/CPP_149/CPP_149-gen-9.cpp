Here's what the solution does step by step:

1. It defines a function called sorted_list_sum that accepts a vector of strings as a parameter.
2. The function iterates through the vector and deletes any strings that have odd lengths. It also decrements the index of the vector each time it deletes a string to ensure that the correct string is deleted.
3. The function then sorts the vector in ascending order by the length of the strings. If two strings have the same length, it sorts them alphabetically. It uses the standard library function sort to do this.
4. Finally, the function returns the sorted vector.

The solution uses a for loop to iterate through the vector and delete the strings. It uses the standard library function erase to delete the strings. It also uses the standard library function data to print the vector.

The solution uses the standard library function printf to print the result of the function. It uses the format specifier %s to print the vector as a string.

The solution uses the standard library function sort to sort the vector. It uses the default comparator, which sorts the vector in ascending order by the length of the strings. If two strings have the same length, it sorts them alphabetically.

The solution uses the standard library function vector to define the vector of strings. It uses the default constructor to create the vector and the data function to print the vector.

The solution uses the standard library function printf to print the result of the function. It uses the format specifier %s to print the vector as a string.

The solution defines the function sorted_list_sum and the main function. The main function creates a vector of strings and calls the sorted
