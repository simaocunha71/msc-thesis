    In the given code, a function `triangle_area` is defined that calculates and returns the area of a triangle based on the lengths of its three sides. Here's a breakdown of the code:

    1. The function `triangle_area` takes three arguments `a`, `b`, and `c`, representing the lengths of the three sides of the triangle.
    2. Inside the function, a label `A` is defined, which is used later for error handling.
    3. The first condition `if(a+b>c && a+c>b && b+c>a)` checks if the three sides form a valid triangle. This condition is based on the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the remaining side. If this condition is not met, the function jumps to the `goto A` statement, which causes it to loop back to the top of the function and try again.
    4. If the triangle is valid, the function calculates the area using Heron's formula. The formula is `sqrt(s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c))`, where `s` is the semi-perimeter of the triangle, which is calculated as `(a+b+c)/2`. The area is rounded to two decimal points using `printf("%.2f\n")` in the `main` function.

To use the function, you can call it in the `main` function with the lengths of the three sides of the triangle. The code provided demonstrates an example usage with `scanf` to read the side lengths from the user.
