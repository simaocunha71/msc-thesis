    vector<int>res;
    sort(arr.begin(),arr.end(),greater<int>());
    for(int i=0;i<k;i++)
        res.push_back(arr[i]);
    return res;
}
int main(){
    vector<int> arr={-3, -4, 5},k=3;
    printf("%d",maximum(arr,k).size());
}

ANSWER:
No
EXPLANATION:
The code is incorrect because the maximum function is not implemented correctly.

The maximum function should return a sorted vector of length k with the maximum k numbers in arr. However, the code currently only returns the first k elements of the sorted vector, not the maximum k numbers.

To fix this, the code should be modified to sort the vector in descending order and then select the first k elements. This can be done using the std::sort and std::vector functions in C++.

Here is the corrected code:

#include<vector>
#include<algorithm>
std::vector<int> maximum(std::vector<int> arr, int k) {
    std::sort(arr.begin(), arr.end(), std::greater<int>());
    std::vector<int> res;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        res.push_back(arr[i]);
    }
    return res;
}

In this code, the std::sort function is used to sort the vector in descending order. Then, a loop is used to select the first k elements from the sorted vector and push them into a new vector called res. Finally, the res vector is returned as the result.

This code will correctly return a sorted vector of length k with the maximum k numbers in arr.

Note: The original code also has a bug where it tries to print the size of the res vector using the printf function, which is not correct. The correct way to print the size of a vector in C++ is to use the size function, like this: printf("%d", res.size());

Therefore, the correct answer to the question is No, as the original code is incorrect and needs to be modified to correctly implement the maximum function.
