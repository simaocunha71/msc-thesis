The encode_cyclic function returns a string that has been encoded by cycling groups of three characters. The decode_cyclic function is the opposite of the encode_cyclic function. It takes a string that has been encoded using the encode_cyclic function and returns the original string.

The encode_cyclic function takes a string as input and splits it into groups of three characters. It then cycles the elements in each group, unless the group has fewer elements than three. The cycled elements are concatenated to form the output string.

The decode_cyclic function takes a string as input and splits it into groups of three characters. It then undoes the cycling of elements in each group to form the original string.

To use the encode_cyclic and decode_cyclic functions, you can follow these steps:

1. Include the necessary header files: `<stdio.h>` and `<string>`.
2. Define the encode_cyclic and decode_cyclic functions as shown in the code.
3. Call the encode_cyclic function with the string you want to encode as the input. This will return the encoded string.
4. Call the decode_cyclic function with the encoded string as the input. This will return the original string.

Here is an example of how to use the encode_cyclic and decode_cyclic functions:

```cpp
#include<stdio.h>
#include<string>
using namespace std;

string encode_cyclic(string s){ 
    // returns encoded string by cycling groups of three characters.  
    int l=s.length();
    int num=(l+2)/3;
    string x,output;
    int i;
    for (i=0;i*3<l;i++)
    {
        x=s.substr(i*3,3);
        if (x.length()==3) x=x.substr(1)+x[0];
        output=output+x;
    }
    return output;
}

string decode_cyclic(string s){ 
    /*
    takes as input string encoded with encode_cyclic function. Returns decoded string. 
    */
    int l=s.length();
    int num=(l+2
