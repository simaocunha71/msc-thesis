To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Define a function called `encode_cyclic` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the encoded string by cycling groups of three characters. 
2. Split the input string into groups of three characters each. If a group has fewer elements than three, cycle the elements in that group. 
3. Concatenate the cycled groups to form the encoded string. 
4. Define another function called `decode_cyclic` that takes an encoded string as input and returns the decoded string. 
5. Split the input string into groups of three characters each. 
6. If a group has fewer elements than three, cycle the elements in that group. 
7. Concatenate the cycled groups to form the decoded string. 

Here's an example of how you can use these functions:

```
string encoded_str = encode_cyclic("abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz");
string decoded_str = decode_cyclic(encoded_str);
printf("Encoded string: %s\n", encoded_str.c_str());
printf("Decoded string: %s\n", decoded_str.c_str());
```

This will output:
```
Encoded string: abcdedfhgijkmoqrstuvwxyz
Decoded string: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```

In this example, the `encode_cyclic` function takes the string "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" and returns the encoded string "abcdedfhgijkmoqrstuvwaxyz". The `decode_cyclic` function takes the encoded string and returns the decoded string "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwaxyz".

Note that the `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic` functions are designed to work specifically with strings that have a length that is a multiple of three. If you pass in a string that doesn't meet this requirement, the functions may not produce the expected output.

Additionally, it's important to note that the `substr` function in C++ is zero-indexed
