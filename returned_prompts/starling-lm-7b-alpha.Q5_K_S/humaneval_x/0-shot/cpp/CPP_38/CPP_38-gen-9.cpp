The function encode_cyclic() and decode_cyclic() are used to encode and decode a string respectively, by cycling groups of three characters. 

The encode_cyclic() function takes a string as input and returns the encoded string. It first determines the length of the input string and the number of groups of three characters that can be formed from the string. It then initializes an empty string, x, and an empty output string. 

The function then iterates over the input string in chunks of three characters. If a group has fewer than three characters, it cycles the elements in the group by moving the last character to the front and removing the first character. This is done to ensure that each group has exactly three characters. 

The function appends each processed group to the output string. Finally, it returns the output string, which is the encoded version of the input string. 

The decode_cyclic() function is used to decode a string that has been encoded using the encode_cyclic() function. It takes the encoded string as input and returns the decoded string. 

The function first determines the length of the input string and initializes an empty string, x, and an empty output string. 

The function then iterates over the input string in chunks of three characters. For each group of three characters, it cycles the elements in the group by moving the last character to the front and removing the first character. This is done to ensure that each group has exactly three characters. 

The function appends each processed group to the output string. Finally, it returns the output string, which is the decoded version of the input string.

In summary, the encode_cyclic() and decode_cyclic() functions are used to encode and decode strings by cycling groups of three characters. The encode_cyclic() function cycles the characters within each group to create the encoded string, while the decode_cyclic() function cycles the characters within each group to create the decoded string.

Here's an example of how to use the functions:

#include<stdio.h>
#include<string>
using namespace std;

string encode_cyclic(string s){ 
    int l=s.length();
    int num=(l+2)/3;
    string x,output;
    int i;
    for (i=0;
