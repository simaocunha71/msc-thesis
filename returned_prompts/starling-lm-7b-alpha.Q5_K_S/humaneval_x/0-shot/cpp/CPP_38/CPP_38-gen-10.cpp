In order to decode a string encoded with the encode_cyclic function, you can use the following steps:

1. Split the string into groups of three characters.
2. For each group, if the group has fewer elements than three, then it means that the last character of the group was cycled to the beginning in the encoding process. So, you need to remove the last character from the group and put it at the beginning.
3. Concatenate all the processed groups to get the decoded string.

Here's an example to illustrate the decoding process:

Suppose we have the following encoded string: "abcabcabc".

1. Split the string into groups of three characters: "aba", "cac".
2. For the first group "aba", since it has fewer elements than three, we remove the last character "a" and put it at the beginning of the group: "aba".
3. For the second group "cac", since it also has fewer elements than three, we remove the last character "c" and put it at the beginning of the group: "cac".
4. Concatenate all the processed groups to get the decoded string: "abacac".

In the provided code, the function `decode_cyclic` takes a string `s` as input and returns the decoded string. It follows the steps mentioned above to decode the string.

You can use this function to decode a string that was encoded with the `encode_cyclic` function.

Here's an example of how to use the `decode_cyclic` function:

```cpp
string s = encode_cyclic("abcabcabc");
string decoded_s = decode_cyclic(s);
cout << decoded_s << endl; // Output: "abacac"
```

In this example, the string "abcabcabc" is first encoded using the `encode_cyclic` function, and then it is decoded using the `decode_cyclic` function. The decoded string is then printed to the console, which gives the expected output "abacac".

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.
