The function encode_cyclic() takes a string as input and returns a string that is encoded by cycling groups of three characters. The function decode_cyclic() takes a string that was encoded with encode_cyclic() and returns the original string.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

1. In the encode_cyclic() function:
   - The variable "l" stores the length of the input string.
   - The variable "num" stores the number of groups in the string. This is calculated by dividing the length of the string by 3 and adding 2.
   - The variable "i" is used as a loop counter.
   - The for loop iterates over the input string, splitting it into groups of three characters each time.
   - Inside the loop, the function checks if the length of the current group is equal to 3. If it is, it cycles the elements in the group by moving the first character to the end.
   - The cycled group is then added to the "output" string.
   - After the loop, the function returns the "output" string, which contains the encoded version of the input string.

2. In the decode_cyclic() function:
   - The function takes a string that was encoded with encode_cyclic() as input.
   - The variable "l" stores the length of the input string.
   - The function iterates over the input string, splitting it into groups of three characters each time.
   - Inside the loop, the function checks if the length of the current group is less than 3. If it is, it adds the entire group to the "output" string.
   - If the length of the current group is equal to 3, the function cycles the elements in the group by moving the first character to the end, and then adds the cycled group to the "output" string.
   - After the loop, the function returns the "output" string, which contains the decoded version of the input string.

These functions can be used to encode and decode strings by cycling groups of three characters.

Here is an example of how to use these functions:

```
string input = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";
string encoded = encode_cyclic(input);
string decoded = decode_cycl
