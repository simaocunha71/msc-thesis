The `encode_cyclic` function takes a string as input and returns an encoded string by cycling groups of three characters. It first determines the number of groups, which is the length of the string divided by 3, rounded up to the nearest integer. It then initializes two strings, `x` and `output`, to store intermediate results.

The function then uses a for loop to iterate through the string. For each iteration, it extracts a substring of the string starting from `i*3` and ending at `(i+1)*3`. This substring represents a group of three characters. If the length of the substring is three, it rearranges the characters by moving the first character to the end of the substring. This is done using the `substr` function. The rearranged substring is then concatenated to the `output` string.

After the loop, the function returns the `output` string, which contains the encoded string.

The `decode_cyclic` function takes an encoded string as input and returns the decoded string. It first determines the length of the input string. Then, it initializes two strings, `x` and `output`, to store intermediate results.

The function uses a for loop to iterate through the input string. For each iteration, it extracts a substring of the input string starting from `i*3` and ending at `(i+1)*3`. This substring represents a group of three characters. If the length of the substring is three, it rearranges the characters by moving the last character to the beginning of the substring. This is done using the `substr` function. The rearranged substring is then concatenated to the `output` string.

After the loop, the function returns the `output` string, which contains the decoded string.

In summary, the `encode_cyclic` function cyclically shifts characters in groups of three to create an encoded string, while the `decode_cyclic` function reverses the process to obtain the original string from the encoded string.

To use these functions, you can call them in your program as follows:

```c++
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

string encode_cyclic(string s){ 
    // returns encoded string by cycling
