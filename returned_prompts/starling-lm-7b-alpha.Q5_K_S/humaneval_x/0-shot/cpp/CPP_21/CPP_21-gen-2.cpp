ANSWER:
Here's the solution:

To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum and maximum values in the vector of numbers, and then use these values to normalize the vector such that the minimum value will be mapped to 0 and the maximum value will be mapped to 1. 

First, we initialize the min and max variables to very large and very small numbers, respectively. Then, we iterate through the numbers in the vector and update the min and max variables if we find a smaller or larger value. 

Next, we create an empty vector called result to store the normalized values. For each number in the original vector, we calculate the normalized value by subtracting the minimum value from the number and dividing by the difference between the maximum and minimum values. We then push this normalized value onto the result vector. 

Finally, we return the result vector, which now contains the normalized values. 

Here's an example usage of the function:

vector<float> numbers = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0};
vector<float> result = rescale_to_unit(numbers);

The result vector will be {0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0}, where the smallest value has been mapped to 0 and the largest value has been mapped to 1.
