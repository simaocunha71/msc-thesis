Yes, your code is correct. It uses the square root of the number to check if it is a simple power of the base. It is an O(sqrt(x)) algorithm, which is a good trade-off given that the maximum value of x in this problem is at most 2^32.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how your code works:

1. The function is_simple_power takes two integers x and n as input.
2. It declares a variable m and assigns it the square root of x. This is done using the sqrt function from the math library.
3. It then checks if m*m is equal to x. If it is, it means that x is a simple power of n, so the function returns true.
4. If m*m is not equal to x, the function returns false, indicating that x is not a simple power of n.

The main function in your code calls the is_simple_power function with various test cases and prints the results. This allows you to verify that your implementation is correct.

Overall, your code is efficient and correctly solves the problem of determining if a number is a simple power of another number.

Here's a breakdown of the time complexity of your code:

- The sqrt function has a time complexity of O(log(x)), but in practice, it is typically implemented using a binary search algorithm, which has a time complexity of O(log(log(x))).
- The multiplication operation (m*m) in your code also has a time complexity of O(log
