To solve this Kata, follow these steps:

1. Define a function called sort_vector which takes a vector of integers as an input and returns the sorted vector.
2. Inside the function, use the standard library function sort to sort the vector in ascending order. This will take care of sorting based on the number of ones in the binary representation.
3. If the number of ones in the binary representation is the same for two or more integers, sort them based on their decimal value. This is done automatically by the sort function.
4. Return the sorted vector from the function.
5. In the main function, create a vector of integers called arr with the values {1, 5, 2, 3, 4}.
6. Print the first element of the vector using the printf function to verify that the sorting is working correctly.
7. The code will output 1, which is the first element of the sorted vector.

The provided solution uses the C++ programming language and the standard template library (STL) for sorting the vector. The sort function is called with the begin and end iterators of the vector, which tells the function to sort the entire vector.

The solution also includes a main function to test the sort_vector function. It creates a vector of integers with the values {1, 5, 2, 3, 4} and then prints the first element of the vector using the printf function.

Note that the solution does not include the necessary #include directives for the standard library and the printf function. These directives should be included at the beginning of the code to ensure that the necessary functions and libraries are available for compilation and execution.

Overall, the solution provides a concise and efficient way to sort a vector of non-negative integers based on the number of ones in their binary representation and their decimal value.
