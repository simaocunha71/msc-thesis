The provided code is a C++ implementation of two string encryption/decryption functions. The `encode_shift` function takes a string as input and returns the encoded string by shifting every character by 5 in the alphabet. The `decode_shift` function takes the encoded string and returns the original string.

In the `encode_shift` function, a loop is used to iterate through each character in the input string `s`. For each character, the ASCII value is obtained by casting the character to an integer. Then, the character is shifted by 5 and wrapped around if it exceeds the range of lowercase alphabets. This is done by adding 5 to the ASCII value, subtracting the ASCII value of 'a', taking the modulus 26, and adding the ASCII value of 'a' again. The resulting ASCII value is then cast back to a character and appended to the output string `out`.

In the `decode_shift` function, the process is reversed. The input string `s` is again iterated character by character. The ASCII value is obtained, the character is shifted by 5 in the opposite direction (subtracting 5), and the modulus 26 and addition of 'a' are used to wrap around if the value exceeds the range of lowercase alphabets. The resulting ASCII value is cast back to a character and appended to the output string `out`.

It's worth noting that these functions only work with lowercase alphabets and don't handle non-alphabet characters. The encoding/decoding process assumes that the input string is composed of only lowercase alphabets.

To use these functions, you can call `encode_shift` with a string as an argument to encode the string, and `decode_shift` with the encoded string as an argument to decode it. For example:

```
string original = "hello";
string encoded = encode_shift(original);
printf("Encoded string: %s\n", encoded.c_str());

string decoded = decode_shift(encoded);
printf("Decoded string: %s\n", decoded.c_str());
```

This will output:
```
Encoded string: mjqqt
Decoded string:
