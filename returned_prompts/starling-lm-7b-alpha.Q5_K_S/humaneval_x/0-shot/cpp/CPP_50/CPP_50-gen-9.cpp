The function encode_shift takes as input a string and returns an encoded string by shifting each character by 5 in the alphabet. The function decode_shift takes as input a string encoded with the encode_shift function and returns the decoded string.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the encode_shift function works:

1. The function takes a string as an argument and initializes an empty string out to store the encoded string.
2. It then iterates over each character in the input string using a for loop.
3. For each character, it calculates a new character by adding 5 to the ASCII value of the character and subtracting the ASCII value of 'a'. This effectively shifts the character by 5 positions in the alphabet.
4. It then takes the modulo 26 of the result to ensure that the shifted character wraps around the alphabet if necessary.
5. Finally, it converts the shifted character back to its ASCII value and adds it to the output string.
6. After iterating through all the characters in the input string, the function returns the encoded string.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the decode_shift function works:

1. The function takes a string as an argument and initializes an empty string out to store the decoded string.
2. It then iterates over each character in the input string using a for loop.
3. For each character, it calculates a new character by subtracting 5 from the ASCII value of the character and adding the ASCII value of 'a'. This effectively shifts the character back by 5 positions in the alphabet.
4. It then takes the modulo 26 of the result to ensure that the shifted character wraps around the alphabet if necessary.
5. Finally, it converts the shifted character back to its ASCII value and adds it to the output string.
6. After iterating through all the characters in the input string, the function returns the decoded string.

Overall, these functions can be used to encode and decode messages by shifting each character in the alphabet by a fixed amount.

Here's an example usage of the functions:

```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<string>
using namespace std;
