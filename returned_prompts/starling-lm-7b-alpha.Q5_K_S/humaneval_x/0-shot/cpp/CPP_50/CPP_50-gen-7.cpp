The encode_shift function takes as input a string and returns a new string with every character shifted by five positions in the alphabet.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the encode_shift function works:

1. It initializes an empty string called out to store the encoded string.
2. It iterates over each character in the input string using a for loop.
3. For each character, it shifts the character's ASCII value by adding 5 and subtracting the ASCII value of 'a'. This effectively shifts the character by five positions in the alphabet.
4. It wraps around the alphabet if the shifted value is greater than 'z' (the ASCII value of 'z' is 122). This is done by taking the modulus of the shifted value with 26 (the number of letters in the alphabet) and adding the ASCII value of 'a' to the result.
5. It appends the shifted character to the out string.
6. After iterating over all characters in the input string, it returns the out string, which contains the encoded version of the input string.

The decode_shift function is the inverse of the encode_shift function. It takes as input a string that has been encoded using the encode_shift function and returns the decoded string. Here's how it works:

1. It initializes an empty string called out to store the decoded string.
2. It iterates over each character in the input string using a for loop.
3. For each character, it shifts the character's ASCII value by subtracting 5 and adding the ASCII value of 'a'. This effectively shifts the character by five positions in the alphabet in the opposite direction.
4. It wraps around the alphabet if the shifted value is less than 'a' (the ASCII value of 'a' is 97). This is done by taking the modulus of the shifted value with 26 (the number of letters in the alphabet) and adding the ASCII value of 'a' to the result.
5. It appends the shifted character to the out string.
6. After iterating over all characters in the input string, it returns the out string, which contains the decoded version of the input string.
