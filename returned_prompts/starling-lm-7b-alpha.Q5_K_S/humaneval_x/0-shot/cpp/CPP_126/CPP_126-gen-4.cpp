In this code, the function is_sorted takes in a vector of integers and returns a boolean value indicating whether the vector is sorted in ascending order and does not contain duplicate entries.

The function uses a for loop to iterate through the vector. In each iteration, it compares the current element with the previous element. If the current element is not one more than the previous element, it means the vector is not sorted, and the function returns false. If the loop completes without finding any inconsistencies, the function returns true, indicating that the vector is sorted.

In the main function, a vector of integers is created and passed to the is_sorted function. The result is printed using the printf function.

Note that the function assumes there are no negative numbers in the vector and only contains integers.

Overall, this code efficiently checks if a vector of integers is sorted in ascending order and does not have duplicate entries.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The function is_sorted takes in a vector of integers called lst as a parameter.
2. The function uses a for loop to iterate through the vector, starting from the second element (i = 1) and going until the end (i < lst.size()).
3. Inside the loop, it checks if the current element (lst[i]) is not one more than the previous element (lst[i-1]). If this condition is true, it means the vector is not sorted, and the function returns false.
4. If the loop completes without finding any inconsistencies, the function returns true, indicating that the vector is sorted.
5. In the main function, a vector of integers is created and passed to the is_sorted function.
6. The result of the function is printed using the printf function.
