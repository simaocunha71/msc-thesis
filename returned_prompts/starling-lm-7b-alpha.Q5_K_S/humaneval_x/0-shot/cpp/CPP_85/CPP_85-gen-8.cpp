The code snippet defines a function `add` that takes a vector of integers `lst` as an argument and returns the sum of the even elements at odd indices. The function iterates through the elements of the vector using a `for` loop. For each element, it checks if the element is even (`lst[i]%2==0`) and if the index is odd (`i%2==1`). If both conditions are true, the element is added to the `sum` variable. Finally, the function returns the sum.

In the `main` function, a vector `lst` is initialized with the values `{4, 2, 6, 7}`. The `add` function is called with `lst` as the argument, and the result is printed using `printf`.

The output of the program is `4`, which is the sum of the even elements at odd indices in the vector `{4, 2, 6, 7}`.

Note: The code assumes the presence of the `printf` function from the C standard library. If you are using a different programming language or environment, you may need to use a different method to print the result.

Hope this helps!

Let me know if you have any more questions.
