The function `unique` takes a list as input and returns a sorted list of unique elements from the input list. It does this by using the built-in `set` data structure, which automatically eliminates duplicate values, and then converting the set back into a list while sorting it.

Here is the step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. The function `unique` takes a single parameter `l`, which is the input list.
2. The `set` function is used to create a set from the input list. Since sets only allow unique values, this automatically eliminates any duplicate values from the list.
3. The `sorted` function is used to convert the set back into a list while sorting it in ascending order.
4. The sorted list of unique elements is then returned as the output of the function.
5. The function is tested with a sample list `[5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]` to verify that it correctly eliminates duplicate values and sorts the resulting list.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the use of the `sorted` function, where n is the length of the input list. The space complexity is also O(n) due to the use of the `set` data structure to store the unique elements.

This solution is an efficient way to find and return the unique elements from a list while maintaining the order of the elements in the original list.
