def compare(game,guess):
    return [abs(game[i]-guess[i]) for i in range(len(game))]




```

The above code is a Python function that compares two arrays of the same length, game and guess, and returns a new array of the same length. Each element in the returned array represents the absolute difference between the corresponding elements in the game and guess arrays. If the guess is correct, the value is 0; otherwise, it is the absolute difference between the guess and the actual score.

The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each index in the game array and calculate the absolute difference between the game[i] and guess[i] values. The resulting list of differences is then returned as the output of the function.

```python
def compare(game,guess):
    return [abs(game[i]-guess[i]) for i in range(len(game))]
```

This code defines a function called `compare` that takes two arrays, `game` and `guess`, as input. It returns a new array of the same length as `game` and `guess`, where each element represents the absolute difference between the corresponding elements in the `game` and `guess` arrays. If the guess is correct, the value is 0; otherwise, it is the absolute difference between the guess and the actual score.

For example, if you call `compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2])`, the function will return `[0,0,0,0,3,3]`. This means that the guesses for the first five matches were correct, but the guess for the sixth match was off by 3 points, and the guess for the seventh match was off by 3 points.

Similarly, if you call `compare([0,5,0,0,0,4],[4,1,1,0,0,-2])`, the function will return `[4,4,1,0,0,6]`. This means that the guesses for the first four matches were off by 4 points, the guess for the fifth match was correct, the guess for the sixth match was off by 1 point, and the
