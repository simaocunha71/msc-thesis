The code provided defines a function `truncate_number` that takes a single argument `number`, which is expected to be a positive floating point number. The function returns the decimal part of the number. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the function works:

1. The function `truncate_number` takes a floating point number as an input and returns the decimal part of that number.
2. It uses the `//` operator to perform integer division on the input number. Integer division is the process of dividing two numbers and getting an integer quotient without any rounding.
3. The `//` operator ensures that the result of the division is rounded down to the nearest integer, which represents the integer part of the original number.
4. The decimal part of the original number is obtained by subtracting the integer part from the original number. This is done using the modulo operator `%`.
5. The modulo operator `%` returns the remainder of the division of the original number by 1. In this case, it gives us the decimal part of the original number.
6. Finally, the function returns the decimal part of the original number, which is the desired result.

For example, if we call `truncate_number(3.5)`, the function will return `0.5` because `3.5 // 1` gives us `3` and the modulo operation `3.5 % 1` gives us the decimal part `0.5`.

Overall, the `truncate_number` function provides a straightforward way to extract the decimal part of a positive floating point number.

Here's a detailed step-by-step explanation of the code:

```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    # Step 1: Perform integer division on the input number using the `//` operator.
    integer_part = number // 1

    # Step 2: Obtain the decimal part of the original number using the modulo operator `%`.
    decimal_part = number % 1

    # Step 3: Return the decimal part of the original number.
    return decimal_part
```

By following these steps, the `truncate_number` function effectively decomposes a positive floating point number into its integer part and
