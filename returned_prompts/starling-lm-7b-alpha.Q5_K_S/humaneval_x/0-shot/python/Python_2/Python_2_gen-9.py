To solve this problem, you can use the modulo operator (%) to find the remainder when the number is divided by 1. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. The function `truncate_number` takes a float number as input.
2. It uses the modulo operator (%) to find the remainder when the input number is divided by 1.
3. The remainder is the decimal part of the number, so it is returned as the result of the function.
4. The input number is also returned as the integer part of the number.

Here's an example usage of the function:

```python
number = 3.5
decimal_part = truncate_number(number)
print(decimal_part)  # Output: 0.5
```

In this example, the function `truncate_number` is called with the input `3.5`. The decimal part of the number, `0.5`, is returned by the function and printed to the console.

Note that the `truncate_number` function also returns the integer part of the number. However, in this problem, we are only interested in the decimal part, so we ignore the integer part in the example usage.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.
