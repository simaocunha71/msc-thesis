The `truncate_number` function takes a positive floating point number as an input and returns the decimal part of the number. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the function works:

1. The function first calculates the largest integer smaller than the given number using the `int()` function. It does this by converting the float to an integer, which rounds down to the nearest whole number. The result is stored in the `int_part` variable.
2. The function then calculates the decimal part of the number by subtracting the integer part from the original number. This is done by subtracting `int_part` from the original `number` and storing the result in the `decimal_part` variable.
3. Finally, the function returns the `decimal_part` as the result of the function.

In the provided example, when `truncate_number(3.5)` is called, the function calculates the integer part of 3.5, which is 3. The decimal part is then calculated by subtracting 3 from 3.5, resulting in 0.5. The function returns 0.5 as the result.

Overall, the `truncate_number` function is a simple way to extract the decimal part of a positive floating point number in Python.
