The largest divisor of a number is a divisor that is greater than 1 and less than the number itself. A divisor is a number that divides the given number evenly, leaving no remainder. To find the largest divisor of a given number, we can use a loop to check all divisors of the number from 2 up to the number itself.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Define a function called `largest_divisor` that takes a number `n` as an argument and returns the largest divisor of that number.

2. Initialize a variable `max_divisor` to 1, which will store the largest divisor found so far.

3. Use a `for` loop to iterate through all the divisors of the number from 2 up to the number itself. We can calculate the divisors by dividing the number by each integer starting from 2 up to the number itself.

4. Check if the current divisor is greater than the current maximum divisor. If it is, update the `max_divisor` variable to the current divisor.

5. After the loop finishes, return the `max_divisor` variable, which will be the largest divisor of the given number.

Here's an example implementation of the solution:

```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    max_divisor = 1
    for i in range(2, n+1):
        if n % i == 0 and i > max_divisor:
            max_divisor = i
    return max_divisor
```

You can test the function with the provided example by running the following code:

```python
print(largest_divisor(15))  # Output: 5
```

This will print the largest divisor of the number 15, which is 5.

Note: The `largest_divisor` function will return 1 for input numbers that are prime (i.e., only have 1 and themselves as divisors).

I hope this helps you understand the solution to finding the largest divisor of a given number! Let me know if you have any more questions.
