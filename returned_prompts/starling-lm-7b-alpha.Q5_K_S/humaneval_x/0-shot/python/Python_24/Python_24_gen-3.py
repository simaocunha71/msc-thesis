The largest divisor of a number can be found by iterating over the numbers from 2 to the square root of the number, and checking if the number is divisible by each of these numbers. When a divisor is found, it is returned.

Here is a Python function that implements this algorithm:

```python
import math

def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return n // 2
    for i in range(3, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return n // i
    return 1
```

In this function, we start by checking if the number is even. If it is, we return the number divided by 2, as the largest divisor of an even number is always an even number.

If the number is odd, we start a loop that iterates over the odd numbers from 3 to the square root of the number. We divide the number by each of these odd numbers, and if the result is an integer, we return it as the largest divisor.

If no divisor is found in the loop, we return 1, as 1 is the only divisor of a prime number.

To use this function, you can call it with a number as an argument, like this:

```python
print(largest_divisor(15))  # Output: 5
```

This will print the largest divisor of the number 15, which is 5.

```python

```

Note: The function `math.sqrt()` is used to calculate the square root of a number. The `range()` function is used to create a range of numbers, and the `//` operator is used to perform integer division.

Here are some additional notes about the function:

- The function `largest_divisor()` takes a single integer argument `n`, which is the number for which we want to find the largest divisor.
- The function returns an integer, which is the largest divisor of the input number.
- The function uses the `range()` function to create a range of odd numbers from 3 to the square root of the number.
