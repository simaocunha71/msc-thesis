Here's a Python function that solves the problem:

```python
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    return ' '.join(map(str, range(n + 1)))
```

This function takes an integer `n` as input and uses the `range` function to generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n` (inclusive). The `map` function is then used to convert each number in the sequence to a string, and the `join` function is used to concatenate the strings with spaces in between. The resulting string is returned as the output of the function.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), as it needs to process each number in the sequence. The space complexity is also O(n), as it needs to store the entire sequence in memory.

Here are some example test cases to validate the function:

```python
print(string_sequence(0))  # Output: '0'
print(string_sequence(5))  # Output: '0 1 2 3 4 5'
```

These test cases show that the function correctly generates the desired output for different values of `n`.

```python

```

Note: The `map` function in Python is a higher-order function that applies a given function to each item of an iterable (such as a list, tuple, or range) and returns a list of the results. In this case, it is used to convert each number in the range to a string.

```python

```

The `join` function in Python is a string method that concatenates all the elements in an iterable (such as a list, tuple, or range) into a single string, using a specified delimiter (in this case, a space) between each element.

```python

```

Overall, this function provides a concise and efficient solution to the problem of generating a space-delimited string of numbers from 0 to `n` (inclusive).

```python

```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.

Here are some additional test cases to further validate the function:
