Here is a simple function that takes an integer as input and returns a string that is a space-delimited sequence of numbers from 0 to n (inclusive).

def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    """ Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.
    >>> string_sequence(0)
    '0'
    >>> string_sequence(5)
    '0 1 2 3 4 5'
    """

    # Initialize a string variable to store the result
    result = ""

    # Use a for loop to generate the sequence of numbers
    for i in range(n+1):
        result += str(i) + " "

    # Remove the trailing space
    result = result[:-1]

    # Return the result
    return result


To test the function, you can use the doctest module as follows:

from doctest import testmod
testmod()

The test cases provided in the question are included in the doctest module, and the function passes all the test cases.
