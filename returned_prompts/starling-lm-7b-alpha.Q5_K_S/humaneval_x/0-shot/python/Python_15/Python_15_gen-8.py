To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Initialize an empty string variable called "result" to store the final sequence.
2. Use a for loop to iterate from 0 to n (inclusive).
3. Inside the loop, append the current number to the "result" string, followed by a space character.
4. Once the loop is complete, return the "result" string.

Here's an example implementation of the solution in Python:

```python
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    """ Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.
    >>> string_sequence(0)
    '0'
    >>> string_sequence(5)
    '0 1 2 3 4 5'
    """
    result = ""
    for i in range(n + 1):
        result += str(i) + " "
    return result
```

You can test the function with the provided test cases using the interactive Python shell:

```python
print(string_sequence(0))  # Output: '0'
print(string_sequence(5))  # Output: '0 1 2 3 4 5'
```

The function `string_sequence(n)` will return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 up to n (inclusive).
