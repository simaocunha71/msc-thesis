The function `string_sequence` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 up to `n` inclusive. It uses the `join` method to concatenate the numbers separated by a space. Here's how the code works:

1. The function `string_sequence` is defined with a single parameter `n` of type `int`.
2. Inside the function, a list comprehension is used to generate a list of numbers from 0 to `n` using the `range` function. The `range` function returns a sequence of numbers starting from 0 and incrementing by 1 until `n`.
3. The `join` method is used to concatenate the numbers in the list, separated by a space. The `join` method is a string method that takes a sequence (in this case, a list) and concatenates its elements with a specified delimiter (in this case, a space).
4. Finally, the resulting string is returned as the output of the function.

To test the function, you can use the `print` function to print the result of calling the function with different values of `n`. For example, `print(string_sequence(0))` will print `'0'`, and `print(string_sequence(5))` will print `'0 1 2 3 4 5'`.

Overall, this function provides a convenient way to generate a string of space-delimited numbers in a given range.
