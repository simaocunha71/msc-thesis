Here's one way you could write the function `string_sequence`:

```python
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    return ' '.join(map(str, range(n + 1)))
```

This function uses Python's built-in `range` function to generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n`, then converts those numbers to strings and joins them together using the space character as a separator.

To test the function, you can use Python's interactive prompt (`>>>`) to call the function and print the result:

```python
print(string_sequence(0))  # prints '0'
print(string_sequence(5))  # prints '0 1 2 3 4 5'
```

The `print` function is used to display the result of the function call on the screen.

Note: The `map` function is used to apply a function to each item in an iterable (in this case, a range of numbers). Here, it is used to apply the built-in `str` function to each number in the range.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.

```python
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    return ' '.join(map(str, range(n + 1)))
```

And here's an example of how you can test the function:

```python
print(string_sequence(0))  # prints '0'
print(string_sequence(5))  # prints '0 1 2 3 4 5'
```

The `print` function is used to display the result of the function call on the screen.
