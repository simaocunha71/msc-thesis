To solve this problem, you can use the following Python code:

```python
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    return " ".join(map(str, range(n+1)))
```

This code defines a function called `string_sequence` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a string containing space-delimited numbers from 0 to `n` (inclusive). 

The `range(n+1)` function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n`, and the `map(str, ...)` function applies the `str` function to each number in the sequence, converting them to strings. Finally, the `" ".join(...)` function concatenates all the strings with a space between them, resulting in the desired string representation of the sequence.

You can test the function by using the provided examples:

```python
print(string_sequence(0))  # Output: '0'
print(string_sequence(5))  # Output: '0 1 2 3 4 5'
```

These test cases show that the function correctly generates the string representation of the sequence for both `n = 0` and `n = 5`.

Overall, the `string_sequence` function provides a simple and efficient solution to the problem of generating a string containing space-delimited numbers from 0 to a given number `n`.
