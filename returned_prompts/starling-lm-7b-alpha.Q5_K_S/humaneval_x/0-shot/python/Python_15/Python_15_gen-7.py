Here's a Python solution to the problem:

```python
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    """ Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.
    >>> string_sequence(0)
    '0'
    >>> string_sequence(5)
    '0 1 2 3 4 5'
    """
    return " ".join(map(str, range(n + 1)))
```

This solution uses the `range` function to generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n` (inclusive), and then uses the `map` function to convert each number to a string. The resulting list of strings is then joined together using the `join` method with a space as the separator.

For example, if you call `string_sequence(5)`, it will return the string `'0 1 2 3 4 5'`.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) since it needs to iterate through all the numbers from 0 to `n`. The space complexity is also O(n) since it needs to store all the numbers in memory.

Note that this solution assumes that `n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` can be negative, you might need to add a check to handle that case.

```python
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    """ Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.
    >>> string_sequence(0)
    '0'
    >>> string_sequence(5)
    '0 1 2 3 4 5'
    """
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("n must be non-negative")
    return " ".join(map(str, range(n + 1)))
```

With this addition, if you pass a negative value to `string_sequence`, it will raise a `ValueError` with an appropriate error message.

```python
try:
    string_sequence(-1)
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)
```

This will print: `n must be non-negative`.

```python
```
