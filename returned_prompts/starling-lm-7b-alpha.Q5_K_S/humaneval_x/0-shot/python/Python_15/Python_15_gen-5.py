Here is one possible way to implement the function:

```python
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    return " ".join(str(i) for i in range(n + 1))
```

In this implementation, the function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 up to `n` inclusive. The `range(n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n`, and the list comprehension `[str(i) for i in range(n + 1)]` converts each number to a string. The `join()` method is then used to concatenate the strings with spaces in between, resulting in the desired output.

You can test the function with the provided examples:

```python
print(string_sequence(0))  # Output: '0'
print(string_sequence(5))  # Output: '0 1 2 3 4 5'
```

This will display the expected results, demonstrating that the function correctly generates the desired sequence of numbers as a string with spaces between each number.

Note that the function uses the `join()` method instead of a loop to concatenate the strings, as it is a more concise and efficient approach in Python.

```python
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    return " ".join(str(i) for i in range(n + 1))
```

This implementation ensures that the function is both clear in its purpose and efficient in its execution, providing a straightforward solution to the problem.

```python
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    return " ".join(str(i) for i in range(n + 1))
```

By using the `join()` method, the function concatenates the strings in a single line of code, eliminating the need for a separate loop or additional concatenation operations. This results in a more concise and readable implementation.

```python
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    return " ".join(str(i) for i in range(n + 1))
```
