This function calculates the nth element of the Fib4 sequence, which is defined as follows:

- fib4(0) = 0
- fib4(1) = 0
- fib4(2) = 2
- fib4(3) = 0
- fib4(n) = fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4)

The function initializes a list `fib_sequence` with the first four Fib4 numbers. Then it iterates through the range starting from 4 up to `n+1` and calculates the `n`th Fib4 number using the previous four Fib4 numbers. Finally, it returns the `n`th Fib4 number.

The time complexity of this function is O(n) because it iterates through the range `n+1` times and appends the Fib4 number to the list in each iteration.

To test the function, it includes three test cases at the end, which print the expected output for the `fib4` function for different values of `n`.

The expected output for the provided test cases are:

- `fib4(5)` should return `4
