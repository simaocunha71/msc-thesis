This problem can be solved by first concatenating the two fractions with a multiplication operator and then using Python’s built-in `eval()` function to evaluate the expression. If the result of the expression is an integer, then the original fractions can be simplified to whole numbers and the function returns True. Otherwise, the fractions cannot be simplified and the function returns False. 

In the code above, the `replace()` method is used to replace the division operator (“/”) in the expression with the multiplication operator (“*”). Then, the `eval()` function is used to evaluate the expression. If the result of the evaluation is equal to the integer representation of the result (as determined by the `int()` function), the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False. 

The function can be tested with the provided test cases and the expected output is:
```python
print(simplify("1/5", "5/1"))  # True
print(simplify("1/6", "2/1"))  # False
print(simplify("7/10", "10/2"))  # False
```
```

As you can see, the function correctly determines whether the fractions can be simplified to whole numbers or not.
