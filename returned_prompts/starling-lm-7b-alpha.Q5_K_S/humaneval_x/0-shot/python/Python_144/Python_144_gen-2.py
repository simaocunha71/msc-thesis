In this code, the function simplify is implemented. This function takes two fractions, x and n, as input. The numerator and denominator of both fractions are extracted from the input strings using the split('/') method and stored in separate variables. Then, the least common multiple (lcm) of the denominators of x and n is calculated using the gcd function. If the numerator of n multiplied by the lcm is divisible by the denominator of x, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

The gcd function is a helper function that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. It is used in the simplify function to calculate the lcm of the denominators of x and n.

To use this code, you can call the simplify function with two fractional strings as arguments. For example, simplify("1/5", "5/1") will return True because 1 * 5 / 5 = 1, which is a whole number. On the other hand, simplify("1/6", "2/1") will return False because 2 * 6 / 1 = 12, which is not a whole number.

This solution is an implementation of the simplify function in Python that can be used to determine if a given expression involving fractions evaluates to a whole number.

In this code, the simplify function is implemented to accept two fractions, x and n, as input. The numerator and denominator of both fractions are extracted from the input strings using the split('/') method and stored in separate variables. Then, the least common multiple (lcm) of the
