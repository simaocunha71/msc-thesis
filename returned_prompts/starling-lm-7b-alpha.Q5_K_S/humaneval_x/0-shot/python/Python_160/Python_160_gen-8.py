# Here's a step-by-step solution to the problem above:

# First, we need to define the operator dictionary:
operators = {'+': lambda x, y: x + y,
             '-': lambda x, y: x - y,
             '*': lambda x, y: x * y,
             '//': lambda x, y: x // y,
             '**': lambda x, y: x ** y}

# Then we can create the algebra expression:
expr = operand[0]
for i in range(1, len(operand)):
    for j in range(len(operator)):
        if operator[j] == '+':
            expr = operators[operator[j]](expr, operand[i])
        elif operator[j] == '-':
            expr = operators[operator[j]](expr, operand[-i])
        elif operator[j] == '*':
            expr = operators[operator[j]](expr, operand[i])
        elif operator[j] == '//':
            expr = operators[operator[j]](expr, operand[i])
        elif operator[j] == '**':
            expr = operators[operator[j]](expr, operand[i])

# Finally, we can return the result of the expression:
return expr

# Testing the function:
print(do_algebra(['+', '*', '-'], [2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Should print: 9
print(do_algebra(['+', '-'], [10, 10, 10]))  # Should print: 0
print(do_algebra(['*', '//'], [10, 2, 3]),  # Should print: 15
print(do_algebra(['**'], [2, 3]))  # Should print: 8

# Note: The above code is a Python solution to the problem. 
# It uses the basic algebra operations dictionary to evaluate the algebra expression.
# The length of the operator list is equal to the length of the operand list minus one, 
# and the operand list has at least two operands. 

# The result is returned as a Python expression, and the length of the operator list
