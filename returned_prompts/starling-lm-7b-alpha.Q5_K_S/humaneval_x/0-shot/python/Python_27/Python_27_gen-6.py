The function `flip_case` takes a string as input and returns a new string with all lowercase characters converted to uppercase and all uppercase characters converted to lowercase. The function uses the `upper()` method to convert lowercase characters to uppercase and the `lower()` method to convert uppercase characters to lowercase. The function then concatenates the uppercase and lowercase versions of the string using the `+` operator and returns the result.

Here is an example of how to use the `flip_case` function:

```python
print(flip_case("Hello"))
```

This will output `hELLO`, as the lowercase `'H'` is converted to uppercase `'h'` and the uppercase `'E'` is converted to lowercase `'E'`.

The time complexity of the `flip_case` function is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because the function iterates over each character in the string once.

The space complexity of the `flip_case` function is O(1), as it only creates a single new string to store the result.

Overall, the `flip_case` function provides an efficient solution to flipping the case of a string, with a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1).

Here is a step-by-step explanation of how the `flip_case` function works:

1. The function `flip_case` takes a string `string` as input.
2. It initializes an empty string `result` to store the result of the flip operation.
3. The function then iterates over each character `char` in the `string`.
4. For each character, if the character is lowercase, it is converted to uppercase using the `upper()` method and appended to the `result` string using the `+` operator.
5. If the character is uppercase, it is converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method and appended to the `result` string using the `+` operator.
6. After iterating over all the characters in the `string`, the function returns the `result` string, which contains the flipped case of the original string.
