Here is a simple Python program that takes a string as an argument and flips the case of each character in the string.

```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    """ For a given string, flip lowercase characters to uppercase and uppercase to lowercase.
    >>> flip_case('Hello')
    'hELLO'
    """
    new_string = ""
    for char in string:
        if char.isupper():
            new_string += char.lower()
        elif char.islower():
            new_string += char.upper()
        else:
            new_string += char
    return new_string
```

Here's an example of how to use the `flip_case` function:

```python
print(flip_case('Hello'))
```

This will output: `'hELLO'`

The `flip_case` function works by iterating over each character in the input string. If the character is uppercase, it is converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method. If the character is lowercase, it is converted to uppercase using the `upper()` method. Characters that are not letters (e.g., spaces or punctuation) are left unchanged. The resulting flipped characters are concatenated to form a new string, which is then returned as the output of the function.

Note that the input string should be a single string, not a collection of strings. The function will only process the first string it encounters.

In the provided example, the input string is `'Hello'`. The function processes each character in the string and flips the case accordingly: `'H'` becomes `'h'`, `'e'` becomes `'E'`, `'l'` becomes `'l'`, and `'o'` becomes `'o'`. The resulting flipped string is `'hELLO'`, which is then printed to the console.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.
