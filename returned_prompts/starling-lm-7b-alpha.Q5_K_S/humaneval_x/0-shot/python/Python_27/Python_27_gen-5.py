Here is a step-by-step guide to solve this problem:

1. Define a function called flip_case that takes a string as an argument.
2. Use a for loop to iterate through each character in the string.
3. For each character, check if it is lowercase or uppercase.
4. If the character is lowercase, convert it to uppercase using the upper() method. If the character is uppercase, convert it to lowercase using the lower() method.
5. Return the modified string.
6. Test the function with an example input, such as 'Hello', and check if the result matches the expected output, which is 'hELLO'.

Here's the modified code with the steps implemented:

```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    result = ""
    for char in string:
        if char.islower():
            result += char.upper()
        elif char.isupper():
            result += char.lower()
        else:
            result += char
    return result
```

You can test the function with the provided example:
```python
print(flip_case('Hello'))  # Output: 'hELLO'
```

This will print 'hELLO' as expected.

```python
