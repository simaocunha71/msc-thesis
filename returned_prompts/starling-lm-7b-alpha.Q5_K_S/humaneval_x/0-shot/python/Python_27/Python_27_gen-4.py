Here's one possible solution to the problem:

```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    result = ""
    for char in string:
        if char.isupper():
            result += char.lower()
        else:
            result += char.upper()
    return result
```

This solution works by iterating through each character in the input string. It uses the `isupper()` function to check if a character is uppercase. If it is, the function converts it to lowercase using the `lower()` function and adds it to the `result` string. If the character is not uppercase, it is assumed to be lowercase, and the function converts it to uppercase using the `upper()` function and adds it to the `result` string. After iterating through all the characters in the input string, the function returns the `result` string, which contains all the characters from the input string with their cases flipped.

Here's an example usage of the function:

```python
print(flip_case('Hello'))  # Output: 'hELLO'
```

In this example, the function `flip_case()` is called with the input string `'Hello'`. The function flips the cases of each character in the string and returns the result, which is `'hELLO'`.
