To check if two words have the same characters, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a dictionary to store the count of each character in the first word. Initialize all counts to 0.
2. Iterate through each character in the first word and update the count in the dictionary.
3. Create a boolean variable to track if the second word is a match for the first word. Set it to True initially.
4. Iterate through each character in the second word. If the count of the character in the dictionary is 0 (meaning the character doesn't exist in the first word), set the boolean variable to False and break the loop. Otherwise, decrement the count in the dictionary.
5. If the boolean variable is still True after iterating through the second word, return True. Otherwise, return False.

Here's an implementation of the solution:

```python
def same_chars(s0: str, s1: str):
    """
    Check if two words have the same characters.
    >>> same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzhaddeddabc')
    True
    >>> same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabc')
    True
    >>> same_chars('dddddddabc', 'abcd')
    True
    >>> same_chars('eabcd', 'dddddddabc')
    False
    >>> same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabce')
    False
    >>> same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzhaddddabc')
    False
    """
    char_counts = {}
    for c in s0:
        if c not in char_counts:
            char_counts[c] = 0
        char_counts[c] += 1
    match = True
    for c in s1:
        if c not in char_counts or char_counts[c] == 0:
            match = False
            break
        char_counts[c] -= 1
    return match
```

You can test the function with the provided test cases to verify its correctness.
