To determine if two strings have the same characters, we can compare the lengths of the strings and then compare the characters at each index of the strings.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. We start by checking if the lengths of `s0` and `s1` are equal. If they're not, it's impossible for the strings to have the same characters, so we return False.

2. Next, we create a set called `chars` to store the unique characters from `s0`. We iterate over the characters in `s0` using a for loop and add each character to the set using the `add()` method. This ensures that each character in `s0` is only added once to the set.

3. After creating the set of unique characters from `s0`, we iterate over the characters in `s1` using another for loop. For each character in `s1`, we check if it is present in the `chars` set using the `in` keyword. If the character is not in the set, it means that `s1` has a character that is not in `s0`, so we return False.

4. If we have iterated through all the characters in `s1` and found that all of them are present in the `chars` set, it means that `s1` has all the same characters as `s0`, regardless of their order. In this case, we return True.

Here's a visual representation of the code:

```python
def same_chars(s0: str, s1: str):
    # Step 1: Check if the lengths of s0 and s1 are equal
    if len(s0) != len(s1):
        return False

    # Step 2: Create a set of unique characters from s0
    chars = set()
    for char in s0:
        chars.add(char)

    # Step 3: Iterate over the characters in s1 and check if they are in the chars set
    for char in s1:
        if char not in chars:
            return False

    # Step 4: If all characters in s1 are in the chars set, return True
    return True
```
