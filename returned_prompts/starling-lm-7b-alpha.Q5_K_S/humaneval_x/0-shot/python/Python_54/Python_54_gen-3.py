To check if two words have the same characters, you can follow these steps:

1. Sort the characters of both words alphabetically.
2. Compare the sorted characters of both words. If they are the same, then the words have the same characters.

Here's the Python code to implement this logic:

```python
def same_chars(s0: str, s1: str) -> bool:
    # Convert the strings to lowercase
    s0 = s0.lower()
    s1 = s1.lower()

    # Sort the characters in both strings
    s0_sorted = ''.join(sorted(s0))
    s1_sorted = ''.join(sorted(s1))

    # Compare the sorted characters
    return s0_sorted == s1_sorted
```

By following these steps, you can determine if two words have the same characters regardless of their order in the original words.

The provided code includes some test cases to demonstrate the functionality of the `same_chars` function. You can use these test cases to verify the correctness of your implementation.

```python
print(same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddeddabc'))  # True
print(same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabc'))  # True
print(same_chars('dddddddabc', 'abcd'))  # True
print(same_chars('eabcd', 'dddddddabc'))  # False
print(same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabce'))  # False
print(same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddddabc'))  # False
```

The `same_chars` function returns `True` if the words have the same characters, and `False` otherwise.

It's worth noting that the function is case-insensitive, meaning it treats uppercase and lowercase letters as the same. This is achieved by converting both input strings to lowercase using the `lower()` method before sorting and comparison.

By implementing this logic, you can determine if two words have the same characters regardless of their order in the original words.
