def solution(lst):
    """
    The function solution takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all odd elements in even positions.

    The first step in the solution is to initialize a variable sum to 0, which will store the sum of the odd elements in even positions.

    Next, a for loop is used to iterate over the range of the length of the input list. The range is used to access each index of the list.

    Inside the for loop, an if statement is used to check if the current element in the list is odd and if the index of the element is even. The modulo operator (%) is used to check if the element is odd (not divisible by 2) and the index is even (divisible by 2).

    If the element is odd and the index is even, the element is added to the sum variable using the += operator. This means that the sum is incremented by the value of the element.

    After the for loop is finished, the sum variable is returned as the result of the function.

    The time complexity of this solution is O(n) because it iterates over the list once. The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a single variable to store the sum.
