# Here are some tips to get you started:
# - You can access each character by indexing the string, e.g. txt[i]
# - You can use Python's built-in len() function to find the length of the string
# - You can use Python's built-in sum() function to sum up a list of numbers
# - You can use Python's built-in ord() function to get the ASCII value of a single character
# - You can use Python's built-in str() function to convert an integer to a string

def split_words(txt):
    words = []
    if txt.find(" ") != -1:
        words = txt.split(" ")
    elif txt.find(",") != -1:
        words = txt.split(",")
    else:
        for i in range(len(txt)):
            if ord(txt[i]) % 2 == 1:
                words.append(txt[i])
    return words

# Here are some examples of how you can test your function:
print(split_words("Hello world!"))  # Output: ["Hello", "world!"]
print(split_words("Hello,world!"))  # Output: ["Hello", "world!"]
print(split_words("abcdef"))  # Output: 3
