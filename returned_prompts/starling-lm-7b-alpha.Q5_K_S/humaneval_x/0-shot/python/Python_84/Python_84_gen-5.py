This solution uses the built-in Python function `'{0:b}'.format(N)` to convert the input integer to a binary string. The sum of all the digits in the binary string is calculated with a list comprehension, and the result is returned as a string.

The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the length of the binary string. The space complexity is O(1), which is the space required to store the binary string.


The `solve` function takes a single positive integer `N` as input and returns a string representing the sum of its binary digits. The function first converts the input integer to a binary string using the `'{0:b}'.format(N)` syntax. It then calculates the sum of all the digits in the binary string using a list comprehension, and returns the result as a string.

To test the `solve` function, you can call it with different input values and print the results. For example, `print(solve(1000))` will output the string "1", `print(solve(150))` will output the string "110", and `print(solve(147))` will output the string "1100".


In this case, the constraints on the input value `N` are that it must be a positive integer between 0 and 10000. The function will return a string representing the sum of the binary digits of the input value.

The time complexity of the `solve` function is O(N), where N is the length of the binary string. This is because the function needs to iterate through each digit in the binary string to calculate the sum. The space complexity is O(1), as the function only needs to store the binary string to perform the calculation.

To test the function, you can call it with different input values and print the results. The provided examples demonstrate how to use the `solve
