Here's a detailed explanation of the code:

1. The function `solve` takes a positive integer `N` as input.
2. The variable `binary` is assigned the binary representation of `N` using the `bin` function and slicing the result to remove the '0b' prefix.
3. The variable `sum` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the sum of binary digits.
4. A loop iterates through each digit in the `binary` string.
5. Inside the loop, the digit is converted to an integer and added to the `sum`.
6. After the loop, the `sum` is converted to a binary string using `str(sum)`.
7. The `zfill` function is used to pad the binary string with leading zeros so that it has the same length as the `binary` string.
8. The padded binary string is returned as the output.

The provided test cases demonstrate the expected output for different inputs to the `solve` function.

Note: The `zfill` function is used to ensure that the binary string has the same number of digits as the original binary representation, regardless of the number of leading zeros.
