To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the decimal number to binary format. We can do this by using the built-in Python function `bin()`.
2. Sum up the digits of the binary number.
3. Return the binary number as a string.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

Step 1: Convert the number to binary using `bin()`. This function takes an integer as an argument and returns a string representation of that integer in binary format. We can use it like this: `binary = bin(N)`.

Step 2: Sum up the digits of the binary number. To do this, we can use a loop to iterate through each digit of the binary number. We can convert each digit to an integer using `ord()`, add it to a sum variable, and then convert it back to a string using `chr()`. Here's an example of how this can be done:

```python
sum_digits = 0
for digit in binary:
    sum_digits += ord(digit)
```

Step 3: Return the binary number as a string. Since the `bin()` function returns the binary number as a string, we can simply return the result. Here's an example of how this can be done:

```python
return binary
```

Putting it all together, the complete solution looks like this:

```python
def solve(N):
    binary = bin(N)
    sum_digits = 0
    for digit in binary:
        sum_digits += ord(digit)
    return binary
```

This function takes a positive integer `N` as an argument and returns the binary representation of that number as a string. The sum of the digits in the binary number is also calculated and returned.

Note: The `ord()` function returns the integer representation of a character, while the `chr()` function returns the character representation of an integer. By using these functions, we can convert between characters and integers in a loop.

Here are some test cases to validate the function:

```python
print(solve(1000))  # Output: "1000"
print(solve(15
