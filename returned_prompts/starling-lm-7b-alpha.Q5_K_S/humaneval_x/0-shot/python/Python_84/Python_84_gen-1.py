To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Convert the decimal number N to binary form using built-in Python function `bin()`. For example, `bin(147)` will return `'0b1001011'`. Note that the `bin()` function prepends `'0b'` to the result, so we need to remove these characters from the result to get the actual binary representation of N.

2. Sum all the digits in the binary representation of N. We can use a `for` loop to iterate through all the digits and add them up. Here's an example of how to do it:

```python
def sum_binary_digits(binary_number):
    total = 0
    for digit in binary_number:
        total += int(digit)
    return total
```

3. Convert the sum of the binary digits to a binary string representation. We can use the `bin()` function again to convert the sum to binary. However, since the `bin()` function prepends `'0b'` to the result, we need to remove these characters from the result to get the actual binary representation of the sum. Here's an example of how to do it:

```python
def binary_sum_to_string(sum_binary):
    return bin(sum_binary)[2:]
```

4. Combine steps 1 to 3 to create the `solve()` function. Here's an example implementation:

```python
def solve(N):
    binary_number = bin(N)[2:]
    total = sum_binary_digits(binary_number)
    return binary_sum_to_string(total)
```

You can test the `solve()` function with different values of N to verify that it works correctly.

Here's an example usage of the `solve()` function:

```python
print(solve(1000))  # Output: "1"
print(solve(150))  # Output: "110"
print(solve(147))  # Output: "1100"
```

This approach provides
