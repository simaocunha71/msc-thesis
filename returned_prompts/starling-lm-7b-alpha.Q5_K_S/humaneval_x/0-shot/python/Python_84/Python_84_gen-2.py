# Here is the Python code to solve this problem.

# The above code first converts the given integer N to binary using Python's built-in bin() function and slices off the "0b" prefix. Then, it adds leading zeros if the length of the binary string is less than 4.

# Next, it initializes an empty string called result.

# Then, it iterates through each digit in the binary string. For each digit, it calculates the sum of the current digit and the previous digits using the int() function to convert the digits to integers. Then, it converts the sum into binary using the bin() function and slices off the "0b" prefix. Finally, it concatenates the binary representation of the sum to the result string.

# After the loop, it returns the reversed result string using slicing.

# To test the function, it prints the result of solving the examples provided in the problem statement.





# Here's a breakdown of the Python code:

# The solve() function takes a positive integer N as input.

# It first converts the integer to binary using the bin() function and slices off the "0b"
