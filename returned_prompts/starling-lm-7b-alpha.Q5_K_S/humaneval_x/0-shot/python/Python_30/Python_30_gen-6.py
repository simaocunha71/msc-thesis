The provided solution is an iterative implementation of the problem. Here's how it works:

1. The function `get_positive` takes a single parameter `l`, which is a list of integers.
2. It initializes an empty list `positive_nums` to store the positive numbers.
3. It then iterates through each element `num` in the input list `l`.
4. Inside the loop, it checks if the current number `num` is greater than 0 (i.e., positive) using an if statement. If it is, it appends the number to the `positive_nums` list using the `append()` method.
5. Once all the numbers have been checked, the function returns the `positive_nums` list containing only the positive numbers.

You can test the function by calling it with different input lists and checking the output. For example, in the provided doctests, the function is called with two different input lists and the expected outputs are displayed as comments.

I hope this explanation helps you understand how the solution works! Let me know if you have any more questions.
