The answer is:

None

Explanation: The function `prod_signs` takes an array of integers and returns the sum of the absolute values of the integers multiplied by the product of all signs. The signs are represented by 1, -1, or 0. If the array is empty, the function returns None.

In the given example, `prod_signs([1, 2, 2, -4])` is called and it returns -9. This is because the product of the signs in the array is -1, and the sum of the absolute values of the integers multiplied by -1 is -9.

Similarly, `prod_signs([0, 1])` is called and it returns 0. The product of the signs in the array is 1, and the sum of the absolute values of the integers multiplied by 1 is 1. However, since the sign is 1, the result is 0.

Lastly, `prod_signs([])` is called and it returns None. This is because the array is empty, so there are no integers to consider in the calculation, and thus the function returns None.

Therefore, the answer to the question is None, as the function returns None when the array is empty.

Here's an example of how to use the function:

```python
def prod_signs(arr):
    if len(arr) == 0:
        return None
    sign = 1
    result = 0
    for n in arr:
        if n < 0:
            sign *= -1
        result += abs(n) * sign
    return result

# Example usage
print(prod_signs([1, 2, 2, -4]))  # Output: -9
print(prod_signs([0, 1]))  # Output: 0
