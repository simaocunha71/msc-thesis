# Explanation
# The given function takes an array of integers and returns the sum of the magnitudes of the
# integers multiplied by the product of all signs of each number in the array, represented by 1,
# -1, or 0. 

# To solve this problem, the function first checks if the array is empty. If it is, the function
# returns None, as there are no integers to process.

# If the array is not empty, the function initializes a variable sign to 1 and a variable result to 0.
# The variable sign keeps track of the product of all signs in the array, starting with 1. If a
# negative number is encountered in the array, the sign is multiplied by -1. If a zero is encountered,
# the sign is multiplied by 0. Otherwise, the sign remains 1.

# The variable result keeps track of the sum of the magnitudes of the integers multiplied by the
# product of all signs. For each integer in the array, the absolute value of the integer is multiplied
# by the current value of sign, and the result is added to the variable result.

# At the end of the function, the value of result is returned as the result of the calculation.

# The provided test cases demonstrate the correctness of the function. The first test case returns -9,
# as the product of signs is -1 and the sum of magnitudes is 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 =
