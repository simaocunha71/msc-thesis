Here is a solution in Python:

```python
def change_base(x: int, base: int):
    if x == 0:
        return '0'
    digits = []
    while x:
        digits.append(str(x % base))
        x //= base
    return ''.join(digits[::-1])
```

In this solution, we first check if the input `x` is 0. If it is, we simply return '0' as the result.

Next, we initialize an empty list called `digits` to store the individual digits of the converted number. 

Inside the `while` loop, we repeatedly divide `x` by the base and append the remainder to the `digits` list. This process continues until `x` becomes 0. 

Finally, we join the digits in the `digits` list in reverse order using the `''.join(digits[::-1])` expression and return the resulting string as the output.

This solution ensures that the numerical base of the input number `x` is converted to the desired base, and the resulting string is returned as the output.

Here are some example tests to demonstrate the functionality of the `change_base` function:

```python
print(change_base(8, 3))  # Output: '22'
print(change_base(8, 2))  # Output: '1000'
print(change_base(7, 2))  # Output: '111'
```

These tests show that the `change_base` function correctly converts the input number to the desired base and returns the string representation of the converted number.
