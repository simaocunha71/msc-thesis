# Here's a step-by-step guide on how to solve this problem:

# Step 1: Define the function `will_it_fly` that takes two parameters `q` and `w`.
# Step 2: Inside the function, check if `q` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse. You can do this by converting `q` to a string and then comparing it to its reverse using slicing like so:
# if q == q[::-1]:
# Step 3: If `q` is a palindrome, check if the sum of its elements is less than or equal to `w`. You can do this by using the built-in `sum()` function and comparing the result to `w`.
# if sum(q) <= w:
# Step 4: If both conditions are true, return True. Otherwise, return False. You can do this by using an if-else statement.

def will_it_fly(q,w):
    if q == q[::-1]:
        if sum(q) <= w:
            return True
        else:
            return False
    else:
        return False

# Now you can test the function with the provided examples:
print(will_it_fly([1, 2], 5))  # False
print(will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1))  # False
print(will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9))  # True
print(will_it_fly([3], 5))  # True

# The function will return True if the object `q` will fly, and False otherwise, as required.

# Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the list `q`. This is because we only need to iterate through `q` once to determine if it is a palindrome and if the sum of its elements is less than or equal to `w`.

# Space complexity: O(1), which is constant. We only need a single boolean variable to store the result, and a single integer variable to store the sum of the elements of `q`.

# Overall, this solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), which makes it
