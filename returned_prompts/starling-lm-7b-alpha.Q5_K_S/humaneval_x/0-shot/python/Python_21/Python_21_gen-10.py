[0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]


Explanation:

In the provided function, `rescale_to_unit()`, we first find the smallest number and the largest number in the input list, `numbers`. We then iterate through the input list and apply a linear transform to each number, such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest number will become 1.

To achieve this, we subtract the smallest number from each number in the list and divide the result by the difference between the largest and smallest numbers. The resulting rescaled numbers are stored in a new list, `rescaled_numbers`, and returned as the output of the function.

The provided test case, `print(rescale_to_unit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]))`, demonstrates the usage of the `rescale_to_unit()` function with an example input list. The function correctly rescales the input list, resulting in the output `[0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]`.

The explanation and code provided should help you understand how the `rescale_to_unit()` function works and how to use it in your own code.
