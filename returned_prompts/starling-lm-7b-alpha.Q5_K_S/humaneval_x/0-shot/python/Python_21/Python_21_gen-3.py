    min_val = min(numbers)
    max_val = max(numbers)
    return [(x - min_val) / (max_val - min_val) for x in numbers]


# Code to test the function
print(rescale_to_unit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]))





# Here is the detailed explanation of the solution:
# The function rescale_to_unit takes a list of numbers as an input and returns a new list of numbers that are scaled linearly such that the smallest number in the original list becomes 0 and the largest number becomes 1. 
# 
# The function first calculates the minimum and maximum values in the input list using the min() and max() functions. 
# 
# Then, it applies a linear transform to each number in the input list by subtracting the minimum value from the number and dividing the result by the difference between the maximum and minimum values. This ensures that the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest number becomes 1 in the output list. 
# 
# Finally, the function returns the output list. 
# 
# The code provided at the end of the solution is a test case that demonstrates how to use the function. It calls the function with a sample input list [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0] and prints the result, which should be [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0].
