def maximum(arr, k):
    arr.sort(reverse=True)
    return arr[:k]




```

```
def maximum(arr, k):
    arr.sort(reverse=True)
    return arr[:k]
```

Here's a Python solution to the problem. It uses the built-in `sort()` method to sort the array in descending order, and then slices the first `k` elements from the sorted array to get the maximum `k` numbers.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n), where n is the length of the array. This is because the `sort()` method has a time complexity of O(n log n).

The space complexity of this solution is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of additional memory to store the result.

Note that the solution assumes that the input array `arr` is mutable, meaning that its elements can be modified. If `arr` is immutable, you can make a copy of it before sorting and slicing, like this:

```python
def maximum(arr, k):
    sorted_arr = sorted(arr, reverse=True)
    return sorted_arr[:k]
```

This ensures that the original array is not modified, while still providing the correct result.

```python
def maximum(arr, k):
    sorted_arr = sorted(arr, reverse=True)
    return sorted_arr[:k]
```

This Python solution sorts the array in descending order and returns the first `k` elements. It has a time complexity of O(n log n) and a space complexity of O(1).

To use this solution, you can call the `maximum()` function with the array and the desired value of `k`. For example, to find the maximum 3 numbers in the array `[-3, -4, 5]`, you can use the following code:

```python
arr = [-3, -4, 5]
k = 3
result = maximum(arr, k)
print(result)  # Output: [-4, -3, 5]
```

This will print the maximum 3 numbers in the array `[-3, -4,
