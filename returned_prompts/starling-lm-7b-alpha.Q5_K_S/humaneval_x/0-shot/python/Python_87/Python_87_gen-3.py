# Here is a Python solution to this problem:

# First, we initialize an empty list called "result" to store the coordinates we find.
# Then, we loop through each row in the given nested list. For each row, we find the index of the given value "x". If the index is not -1 (meaning that the value is present in the row), we append a tuple of the row's index and the value's index to the "result" list.
# After that, we sort the "result" list by the row's index in ascending order, and by the value's index in descending order. This ensures that the coordinates are sorted as specified in the problem statement.
# Finally, we return the sorted "result" list as the output.

# Here is an example of how to use the function:

# get_row([[1,2,3,4,5,6], [1,2,3,4,1,6], [1,2,3,4,5,1]], 1) == [(0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0)]
# get_row([], 1) == []
# get_row([[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3) == [(2, 2)]
