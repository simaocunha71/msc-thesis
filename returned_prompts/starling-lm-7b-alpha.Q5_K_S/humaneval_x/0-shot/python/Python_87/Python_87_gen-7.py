# Code Review
# 1. Time complexity analysis
# The time complexity of this function is O(n^2), as we need to traverse every element in the 2D list.
# 2. Space complexity analysis
# The space complexity of this function is O(k), where k is the number of coordinates that contain the number x.
# In the worst case, the space complexity can be O(n^2), where n is the total number of elements in the 2D list.

# Test cases
print(get_row([[1,2,3,4,5,6], [1,2,3,4,1,6], [1,2,3,4,5,1]], 1) == [(0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0)])
print(get_row([], 1) == [])
print(get_row([[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3) == [(2, 2)])

# Explanation
# Here, we sort the 2D list by rows in ascending order and then sort the coordinates within the row by columns in descending order.
# We iterate through the 2D list and check if the number x is in the current row.
# If it is, we append the current row index and the column index to the result list.
# Finally, we sort the result list by rows in ascending order and return it.
