# Time complexity: O(n^2)
# Space complexity: O(n)
# Here, n is the total number of elements in the 2D list, lst.
# This is because, we need to find each row containing x,
# and each column in the row containing x, and sort them.

# The time complexity can be reduced to O(n log n)
# by using built-in sorting function, such as sorted(),
# instead of the bubble sort.
# However, it is not efficient to use built-in sorting function,
# since it requires sorting the entire list, rather than just the elements needed.

# The space complexity can be reduced to O(n)
# by using a single list to store the coordinates,
# instead of a list of tuples.
# However, it is not efficient to use a single list,
# since it requires sorting the entire list, rather than just the elements needed.

```python
def get_row(lst, x):
    row = [i for i, sublist in enumerate(lst) if x in sublist]
    row = sorted(row)
    for i in range(len(row)):
        col = [j for j, elem in enumerate(lst[row[i]]) if elem == x]
        col.sort(reverse=True)
        row[i] = (row[i], col[0])
    row.sort()
    return row
```

Explanation:

In this solution, we start by finding all rows containing the integer x. We do this by iterating through the 2D list, and checking if x is in each sublist. We store the indices of these rows in a list called row. We then sort this list
