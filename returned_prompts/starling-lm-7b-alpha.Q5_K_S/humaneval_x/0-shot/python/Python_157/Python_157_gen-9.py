    def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
        sides = [a, b, c]
        sides.sort()
        if sides[0]**2 + sides[1]**2 == sides[2]**2:
            return True
        else:
            return False

right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False

# Here's the solution to the problem:

# We use the Pythagorean theorem to check if a triangle is right-angled.
# According to the theorem, if a^2 + b^2 = c^2 where a, b, and c are the lengths of the sides of a triangle,
# then the triangle is a right-angled triangle.

# We sort the sides of the triangle to ensure that a is the smallest, b is the next smallest,
# and c is the largest. This is because the theorem only works if the side lengths are sorted.

# We then check if a^2 + b^2 is equal to c^2. If it is, we return True to indicate that the triangle is right-angled.
# If it's not, we return False to indicate that the triangle is not right-angled.
