To solve this problem, we will need to use the concept of Fibonacci numbers and prime numbers. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. The first few Fibonacci numbers are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...

To find the n-th Fibonacci number, we can use the following formula:

F(n) = (phi^n - (-phi)^-n) / sqrt(5)
where phi is the golden ratio, approximately 1.618033988749895.

To check if a number is prime, we can use the following algorithm:

- If the number is less than 2, it is not prime.
- If the number is 2 or 3, it is prime.
- If the number is divisible by 2 or 3, it is not prime.
- If none of the above conditions are met, we can check if the number is divisible by any prime number less than or equal to its square root. If it is divisible by any of these prime numbers, it is not prime. Otherwise, it is prime.

To solve this problem, we can iterate through the Fibonacci sequence until we find a number that is also prime. We can use the formula to calculate the Fibonacci number, and then check if it is prime using the algorithm described above.

Here is a Python function that implements this solution:

```python
import math

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    if n == 2 or n == 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    max_div = int(math.sqrt(n))
    for i in range(5, max_div + 1, 6):
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
    return
