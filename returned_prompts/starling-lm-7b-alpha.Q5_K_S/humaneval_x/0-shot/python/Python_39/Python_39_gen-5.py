This code defines a function `prime_fib` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the `n`-th number that is both a Fibonacci number and prime. The function uses a helper function `is_prime` to check if a number is prime. The main loop generates Fibonacci numbers indefinitely until it finds one that is prime.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

- The `is_prime` function checks if a number `x` is prime. It first checks if `x` is equal to 2, which is the only even prime number. If `x` is divisible by 2, the function returns False. Otherwise, it checks if `x` is divisible by odd numbers starting from 3 up to the square root of `x`. If `x` is divisible by any of these numbers, the function returns False. If none of the numbers divide `x`, the function returns True.

- The main loop generates Fibonacci numbers indefinitely until it finds one that is prime. It initializes `a` and `b` as the first two Fibonacci numbers (1 and 2). Then, it enters a loop where it generates the next Fibonacci number by adding `a` and `b`, and assigns it to `b`, while assigning the previous `b` to `a`. The loop continues until the `n`-th prime Fibonacci number is found.

- The loop condition is controlled by the `_` variable, which is a convention to indicate that the variable is not used within the loop. This is a common practice in Python to avoid unnecessary variable assignments.
