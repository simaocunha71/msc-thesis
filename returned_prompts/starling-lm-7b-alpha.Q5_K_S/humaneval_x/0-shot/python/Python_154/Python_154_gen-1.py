    # To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
    # 1) Check if the second word is a substring in the first word. If it is, return True.
    # 2) If the second word is not a substring in the first word, rotate the second word and check if the rotated word is a substring in the first word. If it is, return True. Repeat this step until the second word rotates back to its original form. If no rotation is a substring, return False.
    # Here is the Python code to implement the above steps:

    # Step 1: Check if the second word is a substring in the first word
    if b in a:
        return True
    # Step 2: Rotate the second word and check if the rotated word is a substring in the first word
    else:
        for i in range(len(b)):
            b_rotated = b[i:]+b[:i]
            if b_rotated in a:
                return True
        return False

# Test the function
print(cycpattern_check("abcd","abd")) # False
print(cycpattern_check("hello","ell")) # True
print(cycpattern_check("whassup","psus")) # False
print(cycpattern_check("abab","baa")) # True
print(cycpattern_check("efef","eeff")) # False
print(cycpattern_check("himenss","simen")) # True

# Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the first word.
# Space complexity: O(1).

# Note: The rotate step can be optimized by using a single string concatenation operation instead of slicing the string. For example, if b is "abc" and i is 1, then b_rotated = b[i:]+b[:i] can be written as b_rotated = b[i:]+b[:i] = b[1:]+b[:1]. The time complexity of this operation is O(1).

# This problem can be solved using KMP string matching algorithm, which has a linear time complexity. However
