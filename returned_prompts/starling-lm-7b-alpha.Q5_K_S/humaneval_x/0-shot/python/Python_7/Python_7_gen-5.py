The function filter_by_substring takes in two parameters: strings, a list of strings, and substring, a string. It returns a new list that only contains strings from the input list that contain the given substring.

In the implementation, a list comprehension is used to iterate over each string in the input list. For each string, it checks if the substring is present using the "in" operator. If the substring is found in the string, the string is included in the new list.

The provided test cases demonstrate the usage of the function. The first test case passes an empty list and a substring 'a', and the function returns an empty list. The second test case passes a list of strings ['abc', 'bacd', 'cde', 'array'] and a substring 'a'. The function returns a list ['abc', 'bacd', 'array'] because only these strings contain the substring 'a'.

Overall, this function provides a convenient way to filter a list of strings based on the presence of a specific substring.
