To determine if a given string is a palindrome, we can follow these steps:

1. Remove any whitespace and punctuation marks from the string using the `translate()` method. This ensures that the palindrome check is case-insensitive and ignores any non-alphanumeric characters.
2. Convert the modified string to lowercase using the `lower()` method. This is done to make the palindrome check case-insensitive.
3. Reverse the modified string using slicing (`[::-1]`). This creates a new string that is the reverse of the original string.
4. Compare the reversed string with the original modified string using the `==` operator. If they are equal, the string is a palindrome.

Here's the modified `is_palindrome()` function that implements these steps:

```python
def is_palindrome(text: str) -> bool:
    modified_text = text.translate(str.maketrans('', '', string.whitespace + string.punctuation))
    modified_text = modified_text.lower()
    reversed_text = modified_text[::-1]
    return modified_text == reversed_text
```

You can now use this function to check if a given string is a palindrome:

```python
print(is_palindrome(''))  # True
print(is_palindrome('aba'))  # True
print(is_palindrome('aaaaa'))  # True
print(is_palindrome('zbcd'))  # False
```

Note that this implementation considers whitespace and punctuation marks as part of the palindrome. If you want to ignore them, you can modify the function accordingly.

It's worth mentioning that there are more efficient algorithms to check if a string is a palindrome, but this implementation provides a straightforward solution that works correctly.

In terms of complexity, the `translate()`, `lower()`, and `[::-1]` operations have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string. The `==` comparison also has a time complexity of O(n). Therefore, the overall time complexity of this implementation is O(n).
