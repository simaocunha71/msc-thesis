Here's a Python function that checks if a string is a palindrome:

```python
def is_palindrome(text: str):
    return text == text[::-1]
```

This function works by comparing the original string to its reverse (`text[::-1]`). If the two are identical, the string is a palindrome.

Here are a few examples of how you can use the `is_palindrome` function:

```python
print(is_palindrome(''))  # True
print(is_palindrome('aba'))  # True
print(is_palindrome('aaaaa'))  # True
print(is_palindrome('zbcd'))  # False
```

As you can see, the function correctly identifies whether each string is a palindrome or not.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because it needs to iterate through the entire string to reverse it. The space complexity is O(1), as it only uses a single variable to store the reversed string.

In summary, the `is_palindrome` function efficiently checks if a given string is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse.

```python
def is_palindrome(text: str):
    return text == text[::-1]
```
