The add function is a simple function that takes two integer parameters, x and y, and returns their sum. It can be used to add any two numbers together. Here are a couple of examples of how to use the add function:

```python
print(add(2, 3))  # Output: 5
print(add(5, 7))  # Output: 12
```

The function can be tested using the doctest module, which allows you to include examples and expected outputs in the docstring of the function. This can be useful for ensuring that the function is working correctly.

Here is an example of how the doctest module can be used to test the add function:

```python
import doctest

def test_add():
    doctest.register_optionflag('EXTRA')
    doctest.run_docstring_examples(add, 'add', name='add')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    test_add()
```

The test_add function uses the doctest.register_optionflag method to allow the use of the EXTRA flag, which can be used to include additional test cases. The doctest.run_docstring_examples method is then used to run the examples in the docstring of the add function.

By running the test_add function, all of the examples in the docstring of the add function will be tested, and any discrepancies between the expected and actual outputs will be reported.

```python
print(add(2, 3))  # Output: 5
print(add(5, 7))  # Output: 12
```

```python
print(add(2, 3))  # Output: 5
print(add(5, 7))  # Output: 12
```

Here are some additional examples of how to use the add function:

```python
print(add(3, 4))  # Output: 7
print(add(6, 8))  # Output: 14
print(add(9, 10))  # Output: 19
```

```python
print(add(2, 3))  # Output
