In Python, you can write a function to add two numbers using the `def` keyword. Here's an example of a function called `add` that takes two integer arguments `x` and `y`, and returns their sum:

```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    """Add two numbers x and y"""
    return x + y
```

To test the function, you can use the `>>>` notation followed by the function call and the expected result. For example, `>>> add(2, 3)` should return `5` and `>>> add(5, 7)` should return `12`. 

You can add comments to your code using `"""` to provide explanations or additional information about the function.

To use the function, you can simply call it with the desired arguments, like `add(2, 3)` or `add(5, 7)`.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.
