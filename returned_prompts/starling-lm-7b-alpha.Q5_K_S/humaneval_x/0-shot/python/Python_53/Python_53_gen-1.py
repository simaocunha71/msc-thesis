In this code, the add function takes two parameters, x and y, representing two integer values. The function then adds these two numbers together and returns the result. The add function is tested with two examples: add(2, 3) and add(5, 7). The expected results are shown in the comments next to each test case.




To use the add function, you can call it with two integer arguments like this:

add(2, 3)  # returns 5
add(5, 7)  # returns 12

You can also assign the result of the function call to a variable and use it later in your code:

result = add(2, 3)
print(result)  # prints 5

Here are some additional test cases to verify the correctness of the add function:

add(0, 0)  # returns 0
add(-2, 3)  # returns 1
add(5, -7)  # returns -2
