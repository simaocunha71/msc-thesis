The add function in Python is used to add two numbers, x and y. It takes two parameters, x and y, and returns the sum of the two numbers. The function is defined as follows:

```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    """Add two numbers x and y"""
    return x + y
```

To use the add function, you simply call it with the desired values for x and y. For example, if you want to add 2 and 3, you would call the function like this:

```python
result = add(2, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 5
```

Similarly, if you want to add 5 and 7, you would call the function like this:

```python
result = add(5, 7)
print(result)  # Output: 12
```

In the add function, the return statement `return x + y` is used to calculate and return the sum of x and y. The `+` operator is used to perform the addition operation.

You can use the add function in your Python code to add any two numbers by providing the desired values for x and y as arguments to the function.

Here are some additional examples of using the add function:

```python
result = add(10, 20)
print(result)  # Output: 30

result = add(3, 4)
print(result)  # Output: 7
```

By following the usage of the add function, you can easily add any two numbers in your Python code.

Note: The `print` statement is used to display the result of the addition operation on the console. You can modify or remove it according to your requirements.

In the provided code, the add function is documented using docstrings. Docstrings are a way to provide a brief description of what the function does and how to use it. They are enclosed in triple quotes (`"""` or `'''`) and are typically used for functions, classes, and modules.

The docstring for the add function, `"""Add two numbers x and y"""`, provides a clear explanation of what the function does and how it can be used. This documentation helps other programmers understand the purpose and
