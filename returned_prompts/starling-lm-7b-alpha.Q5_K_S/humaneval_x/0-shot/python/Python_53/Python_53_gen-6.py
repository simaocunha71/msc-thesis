In the provided code snippet, the `add` function takes two integer arguments `x` and `y` and returns their sum. The function is documented with a docstring that explains its purpose and provides examples of how to use it.

Here are a couple of examples to demonstrate the usage of the `add` function:

Example 1:
```python
print(add(2, 3))  # Output: 5
```
In this example, the `add` function is called with the arguments `2` and `3`. The function adds these two numbers together (`2 + 3 = 5`) and returns the result.

Example 2:
```python
print(add(5, 7))  # Output: 12
```
In this example, the `add` function is called with the arguments `5` and `7`. The function adds these two numbers together (`5 + 7 = 12`) and returns the result.

By using the `add` function with different combinations of integer arguments, you can perform addition operations and obtain the desired sum.

Note: The code snippet provided is just a function definition and does not include the actual implementation of the addition operation. In a real programming scenario, you would need to implement the `add` function to perform the addition operation correctly.

Please note that the provided code snippet is incomplete and lacks the actual implementation of the `add` function. You would need to define the function body to perform the addition operation and return the result.

Here's an example of a complete implementation of the `add` function in Python:

```python
def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    return x + y
```

With this implementation, you can now use the `add` function to add two integers together and obtain the sum.

```python
print(add(2, 3))  # Output: 5
print(add(5, 7))  # Output: 12
```

In this updated implementation, the `add` function takes two integer arguments `x` and `y` and returns their sum by using the `+` operator. The `-> int` part in the function signature indicates that the function will return an integer value.
