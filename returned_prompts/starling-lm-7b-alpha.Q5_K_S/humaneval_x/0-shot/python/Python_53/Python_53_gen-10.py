In Python, the function add(x, y) is defined to add two numbers x and y. The function takes two integer arguments, x and y, and returns their sum. The docstring for the function provides an example of how to use the function and demonstrates its behavior with some test cases.

To use the function, you can simply call it with the desired values for x and y. For example, to add the numbers 2 and 3, you would call the function like this: add(2, 3). The function would return the result 5.

Here are some additional examples of how to use the function:

- To add the numbers 5 and 7, you would call the function like this: add(5, 7). The function would return the result 12.
- To add the numbers 10 and 20, you would call the function like this: add(10, 20). The function would return the result 30.

You can use the function add(x, y) in your own Python code to perform addition operations on integers.

Here is some additional documentation on how to use the function:

- The function add(x, y) takes two integer arguments, x and y. These arguments represent the numbers you want to add together.
- The function returns the sum of the two input numbers, x and y.
- You can call the function by providing the desired values for x and y as arguments. For example, to add the numbers 3 and 4, you would call the function like this: add(3, 4). The function would return the result 7.

Some additional tips for using the function add(x, y):

- Make sure that the input values for x and y are integers. The function will not work correctly if the input values are not integers.
- You can use the function add(x, y) in your own Python code to perform addition operations on integers. Simply provide the desired values for x and y as arguments to the function, and it will return the sum of the two input numbers.

Overall, the function add(x, y) is a simple and convenient way to add two numbers together in Python. It takes two integer arguments, x and y, and returns their sum. You can use the function in your own code to perform addition
