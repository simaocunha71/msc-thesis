In this code, the add function is defined to take two integer parameters, x and y. The function simply returns the sum of the two input numbers, x and y. The function is documented using a triple-quoted string immediately after the function definition.

The function is then tested using the doctest module to ensure that it correctly adds the numbers 2 and 3, as well as the numbers 5 and 7. The expected output for each test is provided after the double colon (::).

To run the tests, you can use the doctest.testmod() function, which will execute the code in the module and compare the output with the expected output. If all tests pass, the function is working correctly.

Here's an example of how you can use the add function and run the tests:

```python
import doctest

def add(x, y):
    """Add two numbers x and y
    >>> add(2, 3)
    5
    >>> add(5, 7)
    12
    """
    return x + y

# Run the tests using doctest
result = doctest.testmod()
if result == 0:
    print("All tests passed.")
else:
    print("Some tests failed.")

# Use the add function to add two numbers
sum = add(5, 7)
print(sum)  # Output: 12
```

When you run this code, you'll see that all tests pass and the add function correctly adds the numbers 5 and 7 to give the result 12.

You can add more tests to the function's documentation to cover additional scenarios or edge cases. The doctest module will automatically run and verify these tests when you use the testmod() function.

Note: The doctest module is available in Python 2.7 and Python 3.x, so it can be used in both versions of the language.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.
