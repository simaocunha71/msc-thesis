The add function takes in two integers, x and y, and returns their sum. Here are some examples of how to use the add function:

```python
>>> add(2, 3)
5
>>> add(5, 7)
12
```

In the first example, the function is called with the arguments 2 and 3. The function adds these two numbers together and returns the result, which is 5.

In the second example, the function is called with the arguments 5 and 7. Again, the function adds these two numbers together and returns the result, which is 12.

You can use the add function in your code to add any two integers together. Simply call the function with the desired arguments and assign the returned value to a variable of your choice.

For example, if you want to add the numbers 4 and 6, you can do so by calling the add function like this:

```python
result = add(4, 6)
```

After executing this line of code, the variable "result" will hold the value 10, which is the sum of 4 and 6. You can then use this value in your code as needed.

In summary, the add function is a straightforward way to add two integers together in Python. By calling the function with the desired arguments, you can obtain the sum of these numbers and use it in your program as needed.

Here are some additional examples of using the add function:

```python
>>> add(10, 20)
30
>>> add(-5, 8)
3
>>> add(0, 0)
0
```

These examples illustrate how the add function can be used with different sets of arguments to calculate the sum of any two integers, regardless of their values.

I hope this explanation helps you understand how to use the add function and its capabilities in Python! Let me know if you have any more questions.

```python
def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    """Add two numbers x and y
    >>> add(2, 3)
    5
    >>> add(5, 7)
    12
    """
    return x + y
```
