The add function takes two parameters, x and y, which are both integers. It adds the two numbers together and returns the result. The function can be used to add any two numbers.

Here are a few examples of how to use the function:

- add(2, 3) returns 5 because 2 + 3 is 5.
- add(5, 7) returns 12 because 5 + 7 is 12.

To use the function, you simply need to call it with the two numbers you want to add as arguments, separated by commas. The function will then calculate the sum and return the result.

For example, to add the numbers 3 and 4, you would call the function like this: add(3, 4). The function would return 7, which is the sum of 3 and 4.

You can use this function to add any two numbers together, as long as they are both integers.

Here are a few more examples of how to use the function:

- add(10, 20) returns 30 because 10 + 20 is 30.
- add(50, 30) returns 80 because 50 + 30 is 80.
- add(7, 8) returns 15 because 7 + 8 is 15.

Overall, the add function is a simple and useful tool for adding any two numbers together. It can be used in a variety of programming scenarios where you need to perform arithmetic operations on integers.

Here are a few more examples of how to use the function:

- add(100, 200) returns 300 because 100 + 200 is 300.
- add(500, 300) returns 800 because 500 + 300 is 800.
- add(700, 800) returns 1500 because 700 + 800 is 1500.

In each of these examples, the add function is used to add two integers together and returns the sum as the result. This can be useful in a variety of programming scenarios where you
