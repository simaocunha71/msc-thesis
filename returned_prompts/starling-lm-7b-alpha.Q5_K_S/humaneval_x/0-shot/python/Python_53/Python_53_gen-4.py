In this programming question, you are asked to define a function called add that takes two integer parameters, x and y, and returns their sum. The function should be documented with a docstring that provides a brief explanation of what the function does and includes a few sample test cases.

Here is an example of how you can define the add function and provide a docstring:

```python
def add(x: int, y: int):
    """Add two numbers x and y
    >>> add(2, 3)
    5
    >>> add(5, 7)
    12
    """
    return x + y
```

In this code, the add function takes two parameters, x and y, and returns their sum by adding them together using the '+' operator. The docstring provides a brief explanation of what the function does, followed by a few sample test cases.

To use the add function, you can call it with two integer arguments, like this:

```python
result = add(2, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 5
```

This will call the add function with x=2 and y=3, and store the result in the variable result. Then, the result variable will be printed, which will display the sum of 2 and 3, which is 5.

You can also test the add function with other arguments to verify that it works correctly. For example, calling add(5, 7) will return 12, as indicated in the docstring.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.
