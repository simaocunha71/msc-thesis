To determine if a number is prime, we need to check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. The function `is_prime` takes a single parameter `n`, which is the number we want to check.
2. We initialize a boolean variable `is_prime` with the value `True`. This variable will be used to store the result of our check.
3. We start a loop that iterates over the range from 2 to `n-1`. This range represents all the potential factors of `n`. We don't need to check if `n` is divisible by `n` itself or by 1, as those are trivially true and don't contribute to determining whether `n` is prime.
4. Inside the loop, we use the modulo operator `%` to check if `n` is divisible by the current value of `i`. If the remainder is 0, it means `n` is divisible by `i`, and therefore not a prime number. In this case, we set the `is_prime` variable to `False` and break out of the loop.
5. After the loop, we check the value of the `is_prime` variable. If it is still `True`, it means that no factors other than 1 and `n` were found, and therefore `n` is a prime number. We return `True` in this case. Otherwise, we return `False`.
6. Finally, we provide a series of example test cases using the `>>>` syntax to demonstrate the correctness of the `is_prime` function.

Overall, this function correctly determines whether a given number is prime or not by checking if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.
