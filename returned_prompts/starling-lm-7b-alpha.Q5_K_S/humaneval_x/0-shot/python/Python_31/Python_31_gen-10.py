To determine whether a number is prime or not, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. We can do this by iterating through all the numbers from 2 to the square root of the given number, checking if it is divisible by any of them. If it is not divisible by any of the numbers, we can conclude that it is prime.
Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. The function `is_prime` takes one parameter `n`, which is the number we want to check for primality.
2. We initialize a boolean variable `is_prime` to `True`, assuming that the number is prime until proven otherwise.
3. We calculate the square root of `n` using the `math.sqrt` function and store it in the variable `sqrt_n`. We round it down to the nearest whole number using the `int` function.
4. We iterate through all the numbers from 2 to `sqrt_n + 1` using the `for` loop.
5. Inside the loop, we check if `n` is divisible by the current number `i` using the modulo operator `%`. If `n % i` is equal to 0, it means that `n` is divisible by `i`, so we set `is_prime` to `False` and break out of the loop.
6. After the loop finishes, we check the value of `is_prime`. If it is still `True`, it means that the number is prime, and we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.
7. We also include some sample test cases at the end of the function to demonstrate the usage of the `is_prime` function.

By following this algorithm, we can efficiently determine whether a given number is prime or not.
