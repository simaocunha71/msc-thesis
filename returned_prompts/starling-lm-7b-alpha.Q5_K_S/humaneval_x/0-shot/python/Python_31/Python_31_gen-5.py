To determine whether a number n is prime, we can follow these steps:

1. Check if the number is less than or equal to 1. If it is, return False, as 1 and all negative numbers are not prime.
2. Check if the number is 2. If it is, return True, as 2 is the only even prime number.
3. Check if the number is divisible by 2. If it is, return False, as all even numbers (except 2) are not prime.
4. Iterate through all odd numbers starting from 3 up to the square root of the given number. For each odd number, check if it divides the given number evenly. If it does, return False, as the number is not prime.
5. If none of the previous conditions are met, return True, as the number is prime.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the implementation of the `is_prime` function:

- The function first checks if the given number `n` is less than or equal to 1, and returns False if it is.
- Next, it checks if `n` is equal to 2, and returns True if it is. This is because 2 is the only even prime number.
- Then, it checks if `n` is divisible by 2 using the modulo operator `%`. If `n` is divisible by 2, it means it's an even number other than 2, so the function returns False.
- If none of the previous conditions are met, the function proceeds to iterate through all odd numbers starting from 3 up to the square root of `n`. It uses a `for` loop with the `range` function to generate a sequence of odd numbers.
- Inside the loop, it checks if the current odd number `i` divides `n` evenly using the modulo operator `%`. If it does, the function immediately returns False, as `n` is not a prime number.
- If none of the odd numbers in the range divide `n` evenly, the function reaches the end of the loop and returns True, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

You can use the `is_prime` function to determine whether a given number is prime or not. Simply call the function with the number you want to check as the
