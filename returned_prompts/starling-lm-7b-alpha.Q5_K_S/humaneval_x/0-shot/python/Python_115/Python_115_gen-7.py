To solve this problem, we can first find the maximum number of units in each row of the grid, and then use the capacity of the bucket to calculate the number of times needed to empty the wells.

Here is the step-by-step solution to this problem:

1. Find the maximum number of units in each row of the grid.
2. Calculate the number of times needed to empty the wells using the capacity of the bucket.
3. Return the result.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n + m), where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns. The space complexity is O(1).

Here is the Python code for this solution:

```python
def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    import math
    m = len(grid)
    n = len(grid[0])
    row_max = [0]*m
    for i in range(m):
        row_max[i] = max([grid[i][j] for j in range(n)])
    return math.ceil(sum(row_max)/capacity)
```

In this solution, the function `max_fill` takes two parameters: `grid` and `capacity`. The `grid` parameter is a 2D list that represents the rectangular grid of wells, and the `capacity` parameter is the capacity of the bucket. The function returns the number of times needed to empty the wells using the buckets.

The solution first initializes a list called `row_max` to store the maximum number of units in each row of the grid. Then, it iterates through each row of the grid and calculates the maximum number of units in that row by using a list comprehension. Finally, it uses the `math.ceil` function to round up the total number of times needed to empty the wells to the nearest integer.

Note that the `math.ceil` function is used to ensure that the result is rounded up to the nearest whole number, as we cannot have a fractional number of times to empty the wells.

Overall, this solution provides an efficient and accurate way to calculate the number of times needed to empty the wells using the buckets, with a time complexity of O(n + m) and a space complexity of O(1).
