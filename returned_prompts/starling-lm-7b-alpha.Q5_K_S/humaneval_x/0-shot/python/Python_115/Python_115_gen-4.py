To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of 1s in the grid, and divide it by the bucket capacity to get the total number of times we need to lower the buckets. This will give us an upper bound of the answer.
2. If the grid has no 1s, then the answer is 0. If the total number of 1s is less than or equal to the bucket capacity, then the answer is the total number of 1s.
3. Otherwise, we need to find the maximum number of 1s we can take from each row in the grid, so that the remaining 1s in each row can be taken by the next lowering of the buckets. We can do this by iterating through each row and subtracting the maximum number of 1s from the total number of 1s in the row until there are no 1s left in the row. This process is repeated until all the rows have no 1s left.
4. Finally, we need to calculate the number of times we need to lower the buckets to take all the remaining 1s in the grid. We can do this by dividing the total number of remaining 1s by the bucket capacity.
5. The total number of times we need to lower the buckets is the sum of the number of times we need to lower the buckets in step 2 and the number of times we need to lower the buckets in step 4.

Here is a Python implementation of the above steps:

```python
def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    # Calculate the total number of 1s in the grid
    total_ones = sum(sum(row) for row in grid)
    # Calculate the number of times we need to lower the buckets
    total_times = math.ceil(total_ones / capacity)
    
    # If the grid has no 1s, then the answer is 0
    if total_ones == 0:
        return 0
    # If the total number of 1s is less than or equal to the bucket capacity, then the answer is the total number of 1s
    elif total_ones <= capacity:
        return total_ones
    else:
        # Initialize the total number of times to lower the
