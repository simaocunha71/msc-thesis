To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize the number of times we need to lower the bucket to be the total number of 1s in the grid. This is because each 1 represents one unit of water, and we need to empty all the wells. So, the number of times we need to lower the bucket is the sum of all the values in the grid.

2. Create a 2D array called "grid_count" to store the number of 1s in each row and each column of the grid.

3. Traverse through each row of the grid, and for each row, traverse through each column. If a cell is 1, increment the corresponding entry in "grid_count" by 1.

4. Initialize a variable called "max_count" to be the number of times we need to lower the bucket.

5. Traverse through each row of the grid, and for each row, traverse through each column. If a cell is 1, update the corresponding entry in "grid_count" by subtracting the capacity of the bucket from it. Then, check if the updated entry is 0. If it is, update "max_count" by adding the minimum of the number of times we need to lower the bucket and the count of the row, column, and diagonal.

6. Finally, return the updated value of "max_count".

Here is the Python code that implements the above steps:

```python
def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    n = len(grid)
    m = len(grid[0])
    grid_count = [[0 for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n)]
    max_count = sum(sum(row) for row in grid)

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                grid_count[i][j] += 1
                grid_count[i][j] -= capacity
                if grid_count[i][j] == 0:
                    max_count = max(max_count, min(grid_count[i][j] + grid_count[i][j-1] + grid_count[i+1][j-
