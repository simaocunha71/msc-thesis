To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to calculate the maximum number of times we need to lower the buckets to empty the wells.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. Initialize a 2D array `dp` with the same dimensions as the grid. The `dp` array will store the maximum number of times we need to lower the buckets to empty the wells.

2. Initialize a 2D array `sum_col` to store the total number of 1s in each column of the grid.

3. Iterate through each cell of the grid and calculate the total number of 1s in the column using the `sum_col` array.

4. Use dynamic programming to calculate the maximum number of times we need to lower the buckets to empty the wells. We can do this by iterating through each cell of the grid and calculating the maximum number of times we can empty the wells with the given bucket capacity.

5. Return the total number of times we need to lower the buckets to empty the wells by summing the `dp` array.

Here is the Python code for the solution:

```python
def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
    sum_col = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]

    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            sum_col[i][j] = grid[i][j] + sum_col[i][j-1] if j > 0 else grid[i][j]

    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            c = capacity
            while c > 0 and j < n:
                if sum_col[i][-1] - sum_col[i][j] > 0:
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + dp[i][min(n-1, j+c-1)])
                c -= 1
                j += 1

    return sum(map(max, dp))
```
