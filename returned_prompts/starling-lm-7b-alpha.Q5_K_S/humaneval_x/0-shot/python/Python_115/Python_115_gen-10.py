To solve this problem, we can first calculate the maximum number of units of water in each row, and then calculate the number of times we need to lower the buckets.

Here is a possible solution:

1. Initialize the result variable `res` to 0, which represents the number of times we need to lower the buckets.

2. Initialize the variable `max_units` to 0, which represents the maximum number of units of water in each row.

3. Iterate over the `grid` and calculate the maximum number of units of water in each row. For example, if the `grid` is `[[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]]`, the maximum number of units of water in the first row is 1, in the second row is 1, and in the third row is 4. So, the `max_units` would be 4.

4. Use the `math.ceil` function to round up the `max_units` divided by the `capacity` to the nearest integer, and then add this value to the `res`. For example, if the `capacity` is 1, the result would be 4.

5. Finally, return the `res`.

The time complexity of this solution is O(m*n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the `grid`. The space complexity is O(1), as the only extra space needed is to store the `res` variable.

The above solution does not consider the situation where the `capacity` is greater than the `max_units`. In such cases, we can simply return 0, as we cannot lower the buckets.

Here is the Python implementation of the above solution:

```python
def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    res = 0
    max_units = 0
    for row in grid:
        max_units = max(max_units, sum(row))
    res = math.ceil(max_units/capacity)
    return res if res else 0
```

The above implementation is very simple, but it may have a higher time complexity in some cases, especially when the `capacity` is relatively small.
