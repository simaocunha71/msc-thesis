To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm to determine the number of times we need to lower the buckets. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. Initialize a counter `num_times` to keep track of the number of times we need to lower the buckets.

2. Initialize a `visited` matrix of the same size as the input grid, with all values set to 0. This matrix will help us keep track of the visited cells in the grid.

3. Use a priority queue to keep track of the cells in the grid that have a value of 1 (representing the water in the wells). Initialize the priority queue with the cells that have a value of 1.

4. While the priority queue is not empty, repeat the following steps:

   a. Dequeue the cell with the highest value from the priority queue. This cell represents the cell with the most water in the grid.

   b. If the value of the dequeued cell is less than the capacity of the bucket, it means that we can empty the cell using one bucket. In this case, update the `num_times` counter by adding 1, and mark the dequeued cell as visited in the `visited` matrix.

   c. If the value of the dequeued cell is equal to the capacity of the bucket, it means that the cell is fully filled. In this case, we can't empty it with one bucket, so we need to add it to the priority queue again. This ensures that we don't miss any cells that are fully filled.

   d. If the value of the dequeued cell is greater than the capacity of the bucket, it means that we can't empty the cell with one bucket. In this case, add the cell back to the priority queue for future processing.

5. After the while loop ends, return the value of the `num_times` counter as the result.

The provided solution uses a priority queue to dequeue the cells with the highest value, and a deque data structure from the `collections` module. The solution also uses a dictionary to store the indices of the cells with a value of 1 in the `visited` matrix, for faster lookups.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n*m*log(n
