To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm that iteratively selects the maximum capacity bucket that can be filled from the grid and empties it.

Here's how the algorithm works:

1. Initialize variables: total_times, grid_capacity, bucket_capacity, and max_capacity_times.
2. Iterate through each row and column of the grid:
    a. For each cell, if it has a value of 1, increment the grid_capacity by 1.
3. Calculate the total_times by dividing the grid_capacity by the bucket_capacity and rounding up to the nearest integer. This gives us the minimum number of times we need to lower the buckets to empty all the wells.
4. Initialize a queue called max_capacity_times to store the maximum capacity buckets that can be filled from the grid.
5. Iterate through each row and column of the grid:
    a. For each cell, if it has a value of 1, increment the grid_capacity by 1.
    b. Check if the grid_capacity is equal to the bucket_capacity. If it is, increment the max_capacity_times by 1 and reset the grid_capacity to 0.
6. Return the total_times.

Here's an example implementation of the algorithm in Python:

```python
from math import ceil

def max_fill(grid, bucket_capacity):
    total_times = 0
    grid_capacity = 0
    max_capacity_times = 0

    for row in grid:
        for col in row:
            if col == 1:
                grid_capacity += 1

        if grid_capacity == bucket_capacity:
            max_capacity_times += 1
            grid_capacity = 0

    total_times = ceil(grid_capacity / bucket_capacity)

    return total_times + max_capacity_times
```

This implementation has a time complexity of O(n * m), where n is the number of rows in the grid and m is the number of columns in the grid.

You can use this function to solve the problem and find the minimum number of times you need to lower the buckets to empty all the wells.
