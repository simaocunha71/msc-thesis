# Here's a step-by-step explanation of how this function works:

1. First, we check if the length of the array is less than 2. If it is, we return the array as it is.
2. Next, we calculate the sum of the first and last elements of the array. We use the indices `0` and `-1` to access the first and last elements.
3. If the sum is odd, we sort the array in ascending order by converting it to a list and using the `sort()` method. Then, we convert the sorted list back to a tuple and return it.
4. If the sum is even, we sort the array in descending order by converting it to a list and using the `sort(reverse=True)` method. Then, we convert the sorted list back to a tuple and return it.
5. Finally, we return the original array.

Here's an example usage of the `sort_array()` function:
```python
print(sort_array((2, 4, 3, 0, 1, 5)))  # Output: (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```

```python
def sort_array(array):
    if len(array) < 2:
        return array
    else:
        array_list = list(array)
        if sum(array[0], array[-1]) % 2 == 0:
            array_list.sort(reverse=True)
        else:
            array_list.sort()
        return tuple(array_list)
```

This function first checks if the length of the array is less than 2. If it is, the function simply returns the array as it is since there are no elements to sort.

If the length of the array is 2 or more, the function converts the array into a list using the `list()` function. This is necessary because Python's built-in `sort()` method can only be used on lists, not tuples.

Next, the function calculates the sum of the first and last elements of the array using the indices `0` and `-1`. If the sum is even (i.e., the remainder of the sum divided by
