To solve this problem, we will iterate through the list and check if the index of the element is a multiple of 3 or 4. If it is a multiple of 3,
we will square the element. If it is a multiple of 4 but not a multiple of 3, we will cube the element. We will then add up all the modified
elements and return the result.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize a variable `sum` to 0. This variable will store the sum of all modified elements in the list.
2. Iterate through the list using a for loop. For each element, check if its index is a multiple of 3. If it is, square the element and add the squared value to the `sum` variable.
3. After checking for multiples of 3, check if the index is a multiple of 4 but not a multiple of 3. If it is, cube the element and add the cubed value to the `sum` variable.
4. Once the iteration is complete, return the `sum` variable.

Here's the Python code that implements the above solution:

```python
def sum_squares(lst):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            sum += lst[i] ** 2
        elif i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0:
            sum += lst[i] ** 3
    return sum
```

You can test the function with the provided examples:

```python
print(sum_squares([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: 6
print(sum_squares([]))  # Output: 0
print(sum_squares([-1, -5, 2, -1, -5]))  # Output: -126
```

The function will return the correct sum of squares and cubes according to the problem requirements.
