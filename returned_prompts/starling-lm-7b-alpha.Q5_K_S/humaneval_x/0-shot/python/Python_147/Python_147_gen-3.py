To solve this problem, we can iterate through all the elements in the array and count the number of triples that satisfy the given condition.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize a variable `count` to keep track of the number of valid triples. Set it to 0 initially.

2. Iterate through the array `a` from index 2 to `n-2` (since the condition requires `i < j < k`). For each index `i`, check if `a[i]` is divisible by 3. If it is, increment `count` by 1.

3. For each `i`, iterate through the array `a` from index `i+1` to `n-2` (since `j` must be greater than `i`). For each index `j`, check if `a[j]` is divisible by 3. If it is, increment `count` by 1.

4. For each `i` and `j`, iterate through the array `a` from index `j+1` to `n-2` (since `k` must be greater than `j`). For each index `k`, check if `a[k]` is divisible by 3. If it is, increment `count` by 1.

5. After iterating through all possible values of `i`, `j`, and `k`, return the value of `count`.

Here's an example implementation of the above solution in Python:

```python
def get_max_triples(n):
    a = [i * i - i + 1 for i in range(1, n+1)]
    count = 0

    for i in range(2, n-1):
        if a[i] % 3 == 0:
            count += 1

        for j in range(i+1, n-1):
            if a[j] % 3 == 0:
                count += 1

            for k in range(j+1, n-1):
                if a[k] % 3 == 0:
                    count += 1

    return count
```
