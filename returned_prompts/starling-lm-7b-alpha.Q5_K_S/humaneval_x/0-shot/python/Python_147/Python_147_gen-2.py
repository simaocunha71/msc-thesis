To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize a counter variable to keep track of the number of valid triples.
2. Iterate through all possible values of i, j, and k in the range of 1 to n.
3. Check if the sum of a[i], a[j], and a[k] is divisible by 3. If it is, increment the counter.
4. Finally, return the value of the counter.

Here is the Python code that implements this logic:

```python
def get_max_triples(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            for k in range(j + 1, n + 1):
                if (i * i - i + 1 + j * j - j + 1 + k * k - k + 1) % 3 == 0:
                    count += 1
    return count
```

This code will return the number of valid triples for a given value of n. In the example provided, the output would be 1, as the valid triple is (1, 7, 13).

Please note that this solution has a time complexity of O(n^3), as it checks all possible combinations of i, j, and k in the range of 1 to n.

Here are some additional observations about this problem:

- If n is odd, then the maximum number of valid triples is equal to the number of odd numbers in the range from 1 to n. For example, if n = 5, the odd numbers are 1, 3, 5, and 7. So, the maximum number of valid triples is 4.
- If n is even, then the maximum number of valid triples is equal to half of the number of even numbers in the range from 1 to n. For example, if n = 6, the even numbers are 2, 4, and 6. So, the maximum number of valid triples is 1.

These observations can be used to optimize the solution, but the provided solution already has an efficient approach to find the number of valid triples.
