To solve this problem, we can use a three-pointer approach. We initialize the left pointer as 0 and the right pointer as n. Then, we iterate through the array, incrementing the left pointer and decrementing the right pointer until the middle pointer is at index (n + 1) / 2.

For each iteration, we check if the sum of the middle element with the left and right elements is divisible by 3. If it is, we increment the count of valid triples. We also update the left and right pointers to move towards the center. If the sum is not divisible by 3, we only update the left pointer to move towards the center.

Finally, we return the count of valid triples.

Here's the Python code to implement this solution:

```python
def get_max_triples(n):
    a = [i * i - i + 1 for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    count = 0
    left, right = 0, n
    while left < right:
        if (a[left] + a[right]) % 3 == 0:
            count += 1
        left += 1
        right -= 1
        if left > right:
            break
    return count
```

In the example provided, the array `a` is `[1, 3, 7, 13, 21]`. The only valid triple is `(1, 7, 13)`, so the output is 1.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) because we only iterate through the array once. The space complexity is O(1) as we only use a fixed amount of space for the count variable and the left and right pointers.

Overall, this solution provides an efficient way to calculate the number of triples that satisfy the given condition.

```python
def get_max_triples(n):
    a = [i * i - i + 1 for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    count = 0
    left, right = 0, n
    while left < right:
        if (a[left] + a[right]) % 3 == 0:
            count
