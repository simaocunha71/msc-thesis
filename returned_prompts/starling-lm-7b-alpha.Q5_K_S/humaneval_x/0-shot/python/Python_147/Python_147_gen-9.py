To solve this problem, we can iterate through all possible triples (i, j, k) and check if their sum is divisible by 3. We can use a counter to keep track of the number of such triples.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize a counter variable, let's call it "count", to keep track of the number of valid triples. Set it to 0.
2. For each value of i (from 1 to n), calculate the corresponding value of a[i] using the given formula: a[i] = i^2 - i + 1. Store this value in a temporary variable, let's call it "ai".
3. For each value of j (from i+1 to n), calculate the corresponding value of a[j] using the same formula. Store this value in a temporary variable, let's call it "aj".
4. For each value of k (from j+1 to n), calculate the corresponding value of a[k] using the same formula. Store this value in a temporary variable, let's call it "ak".
5. Check if the sum of ai, aj, and ak is divisible by 3. If it is, increment the count variable by 1.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 for all possible values of i, j, and k.
7. After iterating through all possible triples, return the final value of the count variable.

Here's the Python code implementing the above steps:

```python
def get_max_triples(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        ai = i**2 - i + 1
        for j in range(i+1, n+1):
            aj = j**2 - j + 1
            for k in range(j+1, n+1):
                ak = k**2 - k + 1
                if (ai + aj + ak) % 3 == 0:
                    count += 1
    return count
```

In this code, we first initialize the count variable to 0. Then, we use three nested loops to iterate through all possible values of i, j, and k. For each triple
