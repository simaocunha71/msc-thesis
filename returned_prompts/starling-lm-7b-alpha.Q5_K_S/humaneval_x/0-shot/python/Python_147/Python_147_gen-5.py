To solve this problem, we can count the number of triples for each possible remainder when divided by 3 (0, 1, 2) and sum them up.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. For each remainder (0, 1, 2), we need to count the number of triples (a[i], a[j], a[k]) that satisfy the conditions.

2. Let's start with the remainder 0. We can calculate the number of triples by finding the number of pairs (a[i], a[j]) where a[i] + a[j] is divisible by 3.

3. Similarly, for the remainders 1 and 2, we can calculate the number of triples by finding the number of pairs (a[i], a[j]) where a[i] + a[j] is divisible by 3.

4. Once we have the count for each remainder, we can sum them up to get the total count of triples.

Here's the Python code that implements the above logic:

```python
def get_max_triples(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        a = i * i - i + 1
        remainder = a % 3
        if remainder == 0:
            count += (n - i) // 3
        elif remainder == 1:
            count += (n - i) // 3 - (n - i) % 3
        elif remainder == 2:
            count += (n - i) // 3 - (n - i) % 3 + 1
    return count
```

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), and the space complexity is O(1).

In the example provided, when n = 5, the array a is [1, 3, 7, 13, 21]. The only valid triple is (1, 7, 13), so the output is 1.

I hope this explanation helps you understand the solution better! Let me know if you have any more questions.
