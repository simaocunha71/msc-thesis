To solve this problem, we can iterate through the array and count the number of triples that satisfy the condition. We can use the following steps:

1. Initialize a counter variable to keep track of the number of valid triples.
2. Iterate through the array from index 0 to n-3 (since we need three elements for a triple).
3. For each index i, calculate the values of a[i], a[j], and a[k] using the given formula.
4. Check if the sum of a[i], a[j], and a[k] is divisible by 3. If it is, increment the counter variable.
5. After iterating through all the indices, return the counter variable as the result.

Here's the Python code to implement this solution:

```python
def get_max_triples(n):
    counter = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1, n-2):
            for k in range(j+1, n):
                if (i*i - i + 1 + j*j - j + 1 + k*k - k) % 3 == 0:
                    counter += 1
    return counter
```

In the example given, the array a is [1, 3, 7, 13, 21]. We can calculate the valid triples as follows:

- (1, 7, 13) satisfies the condition because the sum (1 + 7 + 13) is divisible by 3.

Therefore, the output for the given example is 1, as there is only one valid triple.

Note: The time complexity of this solution is O(n^3) because we are iterating through all possible combinations of three indices.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.
