# This solution first checks whether the input number is a multiple of 4. If not, it immediately returns False.
# Then, it initializes a set to store the even factors of the number. It starts from 2 and loops through all the numbers from 2 to n/2. If a number is a factor of the input number, it adds it to the set.
# Finally, it checks whether the set contains two factors that can form a sum of 4. If it does, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

# The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^(1/2)), as it needs to check at most n/2 numbers.
# The space complexity is O(n^(1/2)), as it uses a set to store at most n/2 numbers.

# This solution can be improved by using dynamic programming, which reduces the time complexity to O(sqrt(n) + log(n)) and the space complexity to O(sqrt(n) + log(n)). However, the improvement is not significant if the input number is relatively small.
