The given function, `is_equal_to_sum_even`, takes a number `n` as input and checks whether `n` can be expressed as the sum of exactly four positive even numbers. The function returns `True` if `n` can be expressed as the sum of four even numbers, and `False` otherwise.

Here's an explanation of the code:

1. The function first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 4. If it is, the function immediately returns `False` because it is not possible to express a number less than or equal to 4 as the sum of exactly four even numbers.

2. Next, the function uses a loop to iterate through all possible combinations of four even numbers that sum up to `n`. The outer loop iterates over the values of `x`, ranging from 0 to `n - 3` (as `n` cannot be an even number itself). The inner loop iterates over the values of `y`, ranging from `x + 1` to `(n - x) / 2` (as `y` must be smaller than half of the remaining sum after subtracting `x` from `n`).

3. Inside the inner loop, the function checks if the sum of `x` and `y` is equal to `n`. If it is, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` can be expressed as the sum of four even numbers. If the sum is not equal to `n`, the function moves on to the next iteration of the inner loop.

4. If the function completes the inner loop without finding a combination of four even numbers that sum up to `n`, it returns `False`.

In summary, the function `is_equal_to_sum_even` checks whether a given number `n` can be expressed as the sum of exactly four positive even numbers by iterating through all possible combinations and checking if the sum is equal to `n`.

Here are a few examples of how the function can be used:

```python
print(is_equal_to_sum_even(4))  # False
print(is_equal_to_sum_even(6))  # False
print(is_equal_to_sum_even(8))  # True
```

The function correctly evaluates whether the given
