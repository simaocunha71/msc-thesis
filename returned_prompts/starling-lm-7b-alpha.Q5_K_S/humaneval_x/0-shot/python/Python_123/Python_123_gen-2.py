# Time complexity: O(n * log(n))
# Space complexity: O(n)

# The time complexity is determined by the sorting step, which has a time complexity of O(n * log(n)).
# The space complexity is determined by the storage of the collatz sequence and the odd numbers, which has a space complexity of O(n).

# Note: The solution provided here is not the most efficient one, as it involves unnecessary steps such as creating a set of even and odd numbers and sorting the list of odd numbers. However, it is provided here to illustrate a simple and intuitive approach to solving the problem.
