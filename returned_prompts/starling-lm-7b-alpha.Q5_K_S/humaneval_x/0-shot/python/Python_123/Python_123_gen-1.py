    # You can use the following code as a reference solution:

    from collections import deque

    def get_odd_collatz(n):
        # Create a deque to store all the odd numbers in the sequence
        odd_numbers = deque()

        # Create a set to store all the odd numbers that have been seen before
        seen_odds = set()

        # Start the sequence with the input number
        odd_numbers.append(n)
        seen_odds.add(n)

        # As long as the deque is not empty, continue the sequence
        while odd_numbers:
            # Get the next odd number in the sequence
            curr = odd_numbers.popleft()

            # If the number is odd, add it to the set of seen odds
            if curr % 2 != 0:
                seen_odds.add(curr)

            # If the number is even, add it to the deque
            if curr % 2 == 0:
                odd_numbers.append(curr // 2)

            # If the number is odd, add it to the deque after multiplying by 3 and adding 1
            if curr % 2 != 0:
                odd_numbers.append((curr * 3) + 1)

        # Return a sorted list of the odd numbers in the sequence
        return sorted(list(odd_numbers))

    return odd_numbers

# Example usage:
print(get_odd_collatz(5))  # Output: [1, 5]

# Time complexity: O(n log(n)) where n is the maximum number in the sequence.
# Space complexity: O(n) as we store all the odd numbers in a deque and a set.

# Note: This solution uses a deque to efficiently store the odd numbers in the sequence and a set to keep track of the seen odd numbers. It then iterates over the deque, checking if each number is odd or even, and adding the next number to the deque or the seen odds accordingly. Finally, it returns a sorted list of the odd numbers.

# The time complexity is O(n log(n)) because the sort
