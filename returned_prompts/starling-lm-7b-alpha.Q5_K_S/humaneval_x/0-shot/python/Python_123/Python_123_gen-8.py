To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize an empty list to store the odd numbers in the Collatz sequence.
2. Start with the given positive integer n.
3. Create a while loop that continues until n becomes 1.
4. Inside the while loop, check if the current value of n is odd. If it is, append it to the list of odd numbers.
5. Calculate the next value of n according to the rules of the Collatz sequence. If n is even, divide it by 2. If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until n becomes 1.
7. Finally, return the list of odd numbers in increasing order.

Here is the Python code that implements the above steps:

```python
def get_odd_collatz(n):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the odd numbers in the Collatz sequence
    odd_numbers = []

    # Start with the given positive integer n
    n = int(n)

    while n != 1:
        # Check if the current value of n is odd
        if n % 2 != 0:
            # If it is, append it to the list of odd numbers
            odd_numbers.append(n)

        # Calculate the next value of n according to the rules of the Collatz sequence
        if n % 2 == 0:
            n = n / 2
        else:
            n = 3 * n + 1

    # Sort the list of odd numbers in increasing order
    odd_numbers.sort()

    return odd_numbers
```

You can use this function to find the odd numbers in the Collatz sequence for any positive integer n. For example, to find the odd numbers in the Collatz sequence for 5, you can call the function like this: `get_odd_collatz(5)`. The function will return `[1, 5]`, which are the odd numbers in the Collatz sequence for 5.

As an additional step to improve the solution, we can add a check to avoid adding duplicates to the `odd_numbers` list. This can be done by
