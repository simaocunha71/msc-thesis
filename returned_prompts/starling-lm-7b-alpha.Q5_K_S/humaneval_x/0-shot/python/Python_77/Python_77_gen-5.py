    # The cube of a number n is n*n*n. 
    # So if we take the cube root of a, and it's an integer, then the cube root is the number we're looking for.
    # This is equivalent to checking if a is a perfect cube.
    from math import isqrt
    return isqrt(a)**3 == a


    # Another way to do it is to check if the cube root of a (rounded down to the nearest whole number) cubed is equal to a.
    # This is equivalent to checking if a is a perfect cube.
    # return round(a**(1/3))**3 == a
