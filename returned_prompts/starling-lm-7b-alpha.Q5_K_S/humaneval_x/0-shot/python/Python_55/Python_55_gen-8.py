The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. The first few terms of the sequence are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, and so on. The Fibonacci numbers are defined by the recurrence relation:

    F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), for n > 1, with seeds F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1.

The Fibonacci sequence can be generated using the following rules:

    F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1, and for all n > 1, F(n) = F(n − 1) + F(n − 2).

The Fibonacci sequence is a common sequence in computer science, often used to model problems involving growth, such as the number of rabbits in a colony after a certain number of months, or the number of days until a particular number of days have passed since some date.

The Fibonacci sequence can be computed using a variety of methods, including recursion, iteration, and matrix exponentiation.

The Fibonacci sequence is often used in computer science, particularly in the field of algorithms and data structures. For example, the Fibonacci heap is a data structure that is used in graph algorithms, particularly for finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph.

The Fibonacci sequence is also used in nature, where it is seen in the arrangement of seeds in sunflower heads, the arrangement of leaves on a stem, and the branching in trees and rivers.

Here are some examples of the Fibonacci sequence:

    Fibonacci(1) = 1
    Fibonacci(2) = 1
    Fibonacci(3) = 2
    Fibonacci(4) = 3
    Fibonacci(5) = 5
    Fibonacci(6) = 8
    Fibonacci(7) = 13
    Fibonacci(8) =
