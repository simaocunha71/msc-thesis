# Explanation:
# The function add takes a list of integers as an input. It initializes the variable even_sum to 0, which will hold the sum of even elements at odd indices in the list. 

# The function uses a for loop to iterate through each index in the list. The if statement checks if the index is at an odd position (i % 2 == 0) and if the element at that index is even (lst[i] % 2 == 0). 

# If both conditions are true, the element is added to the even_sum variable using the += operator. 

# After iterating through all the elements in the list, the function returns the value of even_sum. 

# In the provided example, the function is called with the list [4, 2, 6, 7]. The even elements at odd indices in this list are 2 and 6, and their sum is calculated and returned, which is 2. 

# The print statement then prints the result of the function call, which is 2. 




# In the solution, the function add is defined to take a list of
