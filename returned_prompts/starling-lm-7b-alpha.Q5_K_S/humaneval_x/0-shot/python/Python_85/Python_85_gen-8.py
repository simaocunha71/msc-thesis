The function add takes a list of integers as an argument and returns the sum of the even elements at odd indices. To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Initialize a variable called result to keep track of the sum of even elements at odd indices. You can set result to 0 at the beginning.
2. Iterate over the list using a for loop and access each element using the index variable.
3. Check if the element at the odd index is even by using the modulo operator (%). If the remainder of dividing the index by 2 is 1, then the element at the odd index is even.
4. If the element at the odd index is even, add it to the result variable.
5. After iterating through the entire list, return the result variable.

Here's an example implementation of the add function:

```python
def add(lst):
    result = 0
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 == 1 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            result += lst[i]
    return result
```

To test the function, you can call it with a list of integers as an argument. For example, if you call add([4, 2, 6, 7]), it will return 2 because the even elements at odd indices are 2 and 6, and their sum is 2.

Here's an example of how to call the add function and print the result:

```python
result = add([4, 2, 6, 7])
print(result)  # Output: 2
```

By following these steps and using the provided code, you can solve the problem and find the sum of the even elements at odd indices in a given list of integers.

Additionally, you can use the following code snippet as an alternative solution using list comprehension and the enumerate function:

```python
def add(lst):
    return sum(lst[i] for i in range(len(lst)) if i % 2 == 1 and lst[i] % 2 == 0)
```

This code snippet uses a list comprehension to generate a new list that only includes the even elements at odd
