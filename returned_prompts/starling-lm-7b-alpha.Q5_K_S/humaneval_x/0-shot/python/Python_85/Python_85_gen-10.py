To add the even elements that are at odd indices in the given list, you can follow these steps:

1. Initialize a variable `sum` to 0. This variable will store the sum of the even elements at odd indices.
2. Iterate through the list using a `for` loop and the `enumerate()` function. This will allow you to access both the index and value of each element in the list.
3. Check if the index is odd (i.e., `i % 2 == 1`) and if the value at that index is even (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`). If both conditions are met, add the value to the `sum` variable.
4. After iterating through all the elements, return the value of the `sum` variable.

Here's an example implementation of the `add()` function:

```python
def add(lst):
    sum = 0
    for i, num in enumerate(lst):
        if i % 2 == 1 and num % 2 == 0:
            sum += num
    return sum
```

You can test the function with the given example:

```python
print(add([4, 2, 6, 7]))  # Output: 2
```

This will return the sum of the even elements at odd indices, which in this case is 2.

It's important to note that the `enumerate()` function is used here to access both the index and value of each element in the list. The `i % 2 == 1` condition ensures that we only consider odd indices, and the `num % 2 == 0` condition checks if the value at that index is even.

Additionally, the `%` operator is used to perform the modulo operation, which returns the remainder of the division. In this case, it is used to check if a number is odd (i.e., `num % 2 == 1`) or even (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`).

By following these steps, you can accurately calculate the sum of the even elements at odd indices in a non-empty list of integers.

Note: The `add()` function can be modified to handle empty lists or lists with only one
