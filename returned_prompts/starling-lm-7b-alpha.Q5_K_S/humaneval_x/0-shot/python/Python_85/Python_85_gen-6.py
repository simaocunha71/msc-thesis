In the given question, the task is to add the even elements that are at odd indices from the given list of integers. Here, the list is lst = [4, 2, 6, 7]. The even elements at odd indices in the list are 2 and 6. To calculate the sum of these even elements, we can use the following Python code:

```python
def add(lst):
    sum_of_even_at_odd = 0
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 == 1 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            sum_of_even_at_odd += lst[i]
    return sum_of_even_at_odd
```

Explanation:

The function `add(lst)` takes a list as input and initializes a variable `sum_of_even_at_odd` to 0. It then iterates through the list using a for loop and checks if the index `i` is odd (i % 2 == 1) and if the element at that index (lst[i]) is even (lst[i] % 2 == 0). If both conditions are true, the element is added to the `sum_of_even_at_odd`. Finally, the function returns the sum of the even elements at odd indices.

For the given example, the function will return 2 + 6 = 8, as the even elements at odd indices are 2 and 6, and their sum is 8.

You can test the function with different input lists to check its functionality.

Answer:
8

```python
def add(lst):
    sum_of_even_at_odd = 0
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 == 1 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            sum_of_even_at_odd += lst[i]
    return sum_of_even_at_odd
```

To use the function, you can call it with a list as an argument, like this:

```python
result = add([4, 2, 6, 7])
print(result)  # Output:
