To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Iterate through the list and find the largest prime number.
2. Convert the largest prime number to a string.
3. Sum the digits of the converted string.
4. Return the sum of the digits.

Here is a detailed explanation of the code provided:

The function `skjkasdkd` takes a list of integers as input.

First, it finds the largest prime number in the list using the `max` function with a `key` argument that filters out non-prime numbers. The `key` argument is a lambda function that checks if a number is prime by iterating through all its divisors from 2 to the square root of the number and checking if any of them evenly divide the number. If any divisor is found, the function returns `False`, indicating that the number is not prime. If no divisor is found, the function returns `True`, indicating that the number is prime. The `max` function returns the largest number for which the lambda function returns `True`.

Next, the function converts the largest prime number to a string using the `str` function. This is necessary to be able to sum its digits.

Then, the function uses a list comprehension to iterate through each character in the string representation of the largest prime number. For each character, it converts it to an integer using the `int` function and adds it to the `digits_sum` variable.

Finally, the function returns the `digits_sum`, which is the sum of the digits of the largest prime number.

To test the function, you can provide a sample list of integers, such as `[0,3,2,1,3,5,7,4,5,5,5,2,181,32,4,32,3,2,32,324,4,3]`. The function will return the sum of the digits of the largest prime number in the list, which is `10`.

You can use the provided sample test cases to verify that the function produces the expected output.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
