To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Define a helper function `is_prime` that checks whether a number is prime or not. This function will be used to determine if a number is prime.

2. Iterate through the list of integers and find the largest prime value using the `is_prime` function.

3. Calculate the sum of the digits of the largest prime value using the `sum_of_digits` function. This function is not provided in the question, so you can define it yourself.

4. Return the sum of the digits of the largest prime value as the output.

Here's an example implementation of the solution:

```python
def is_prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def sum_of_digits(num):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(num))

def skjkasdkd(lst):
    largest_prime = max(x for x in lst if is_prime(x))
    return sum_of_digits(largest_prime)
```

You can use this implementation to solve the problem and get the desired output.

For example, if you pass the list `[0,3,2,1,3,5,7,4,5,5,5,2,181,32,4,32,3,2,32,324,4,3]` to the `skjkasdkd` function, it will return `10` as the sum of the digits of the largest prime value in the list.

Similarly, if you pass the list `[1,0,1,8,2,4597,2,1,3,40,1,2,1,2,4,2,5,1]` to the function, it will return `25` as the sum of the digits of the largest prime value in the list.

And so on for the remaining examples.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you
