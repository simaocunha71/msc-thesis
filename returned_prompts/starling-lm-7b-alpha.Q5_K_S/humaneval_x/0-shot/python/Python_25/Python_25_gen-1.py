The provided Python code defines a function named `factorize` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of prime factors of `n`. The function uses a while loop to iterate through all possible factors of `n` starting from 2 until `i * i` is greater than `n`. Within the loop, it checks if `n` is divisible by `i`, and if so, it appends `i` to the result list and divides `n` by `i` until it is no longer divisible. Finally, if `n` is greater than 1 after the loop, it appends `n` to the result list.

The code includes a few sample test cases to demonstrate the usage of the `factorize` function and verify its correctness.

Overall, this code provides a simple and efficient implementation of the prime factorization algorithm for a given integer.

Here's an example of how you can use the `factorize` function:

```python
result = factorize(8)
print(result)  # Output: [2, 2, 2]
```

In this example, the `factorize` function is called with the input `8`. The function returns a list `[2, 2, 2]`, which represents the prime factorization of `8`. The resulting list is then printed to the console.

You can use this code as a starting point for your own implementations or adapt it to fit your specific needs.
