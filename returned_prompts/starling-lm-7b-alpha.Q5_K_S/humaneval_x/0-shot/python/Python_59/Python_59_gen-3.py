To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Start with the largest possible factor of n, which is n itself.
2. Divide n by the largest factor and check if it is a prime number. If it is, return the factor. If not, move on to the next largest factor.
3. Repeat step 2 until we have checked all factors of n.
4. If none of the factors is a prime number, return an error message.

Here is an example implementation of the solution in Python:

```python
def largest_prime_factor(n: int):
    """Return the largest prime factor of n. Assume n > 1 and is not a prime.
    >>> largest_prime_factor(13195)
    29
    >>> largest_prime_factor(2048)
    2
    """
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
    return n
```

In this implementation, we start with the largest possible factor of n, which is n itself. We then use a while loop to check all factors of n, starting from 2. If a factor is not a divisor of n, we increment the factor and move on to the next one. If a factor is a divisor of n, we divide n by that factor and continue checking the next largest factor. We repeat this process until we have checked all factors of n. Finally, we return the largest factor that is a prime number.

This solution has a time complexity of O(sqrt(n)), as we only need to check factors up to the square root of n.

Note that this solution assumes that n is not a prime number itself. If n is a prime number, the function will return an error message.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.

    >>> largest_prime_factor(2048)
