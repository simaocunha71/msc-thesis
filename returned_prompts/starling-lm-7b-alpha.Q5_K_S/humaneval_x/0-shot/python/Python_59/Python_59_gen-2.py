Here's a step-by-step explanation of the function:

1. Initialize a variable `i` to 2, as 2 is the smallest prime number.
2. Use a while loop to iterate until `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `n`. This is because any factors greater than the square root of `n` will have a corresponding factor less than or equal to the square root of `n`.
3. Inside the while loop, check if `n` is divisible by `i` using the modulo operator `%`. If the result is 0, it means `n` is divisible by `i` and `i` is a factor of `n`. In this case, update `n` by dividing it by `i` to get the remaining factors, and return `i` as the largest prime factor found so far.
4. If `n` is not divisible by `i`, increment `i` by 1 and continue to the next iteration of the loop.
5. After the while loop, check if `n` is equal to 1. If it is, it means all the factors have been found and the largest prime factor is the original value of `n`. In this case, return `n`.
6. If `n` is not equal to 1, it means there are factors greater than the square root of `n`. In this case, increment `i` by 1 and continue the loop.
7. Repeat steps 3-6 until `i` is no longer a factor of `n`.
8. The function will return the largest prime factor found.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```python
print(largest_prime_factor(13195))  # Output: 29
print(largest_prime_factor(2048))   # Output: 2
```

This implementation of the function uses a while loop to find the largest prime factor of a given number `n`. It starts with the smallest prime number (2) and checks if `n` is divisible by `i`. If it is, it updates `n` by dividing it by `i` and returns `i` as the largest prime factor found so far. If `n` is not divisible by `i`, it increments `i
