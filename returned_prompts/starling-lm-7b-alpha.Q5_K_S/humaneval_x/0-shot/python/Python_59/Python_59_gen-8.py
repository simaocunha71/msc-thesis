To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Start with the largest prime number less than or equal to n.
2. Check if n is divisible by this prime number. If it is, divide n by this prime number and repeat step 1.
3. If n is not divisible by the current prime number, go to the next largest prime number and repeat steps 2-3.
4. Continue this process until n is no longer divisible by prime numbers. At this point, the largest prime factor of n is the last prime number that divided n.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code provided:

1. The function `largest_prime_factor` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the largest prime factor of `n`.
2. We initialize a variable `largest` to store the largest prime factor found so far, starting with the largest prime number less than or equal to `n`.
3. We enter a `while` loop that continues until `n` is no longer divisible by prime numbers.
4. Inside the loop, we check if `n` is divisible by the current `largest` prime number. If it is, we divide `n` by `largest` and update `largest` to the largest prime number less than or equal to `n` (since `n` is now smaller).
5. If `n` is not divisible by the current `largest` prime number, we increment `largest` by 1 and continue to the next prime number.
6. Once the `while` loop breaks, we have found the largest prime factor of `n`, so we return its value.

To test the function, we can use the provided doctest statements. These statements verify that the function returns the correct largest prime factor for the given input values.

Overall, this code provides an efficient solution to find the largest prime factor of a given number.
