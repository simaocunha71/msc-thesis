The solution to the problem is as follows:

The modulo operation is a standard operation in mathematics that returns the remainder of the division of one number by another. In this case, the modulo operation is used to calculate the remainder of the division of 2 to the power of n by p. This is a common operation in modular arithmetic, which is a branch of number theory.

The function modp(n: int, p: int) takes two parameters: n, the exponent, and p, the modulus. It uses a while loop to repeatedly multiply 2 by itself until it reaches the power of n. Then, it uses the modulo operation to find the remainder of the division of the result by p. Finally, it returns the result.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the function:

1. Initialize a variable "x" to 2.
2. While "x" is less than 2^n, multiply "x" by 2.
3. Calculate the remainder of the division of "x" by p.
4. Return the result.

This function is a standard implementation of modular exponentiation, which is a common operation in computer science and mathematics.

Here are some test cases for the function:

Test Case 1:
modp(3, 5)
Output: 3
Explanation: 2^3 mod 5 = 8 mod 5 = 3

Test Case 2:

Explanation: 2^3 mod 11 = 8

Test Case 5:

Explanation: 2^100 mod 101 = 1

Overall, the function modp(n: int, p: int) is a standard implementation of mod
