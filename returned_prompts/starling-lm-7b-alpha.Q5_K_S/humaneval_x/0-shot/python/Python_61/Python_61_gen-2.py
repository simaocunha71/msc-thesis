In order to solve this problem, we can use a stack to keep track of all the opening brackets we encounter. Then, we iterate through the string and whenever we find an opening bracket, we push it to the stack. When we find a closing bracket, we check if it matches the top of the stack and pop it if it does. If we ever find a closing bracket that doesn't match the top of the stack or if we run out of opening brackets before all closing brackets are consumed, then there are brackets without a match.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the function works:

1. Initialize an empty stack to keep track of opening brackets.
2. Iterate through the input string.
3. For each character in the string:
   - If the character is an opening bracket (i.e., '('), push it onto the stack.
   - If the character is a closing bracket (i.e., ')'), check if the top of the stack is an opening bracket that matches the closing bracket. If it does, pop the opening bracket from the stack. If it doesn't, there is a bracket without a match and we return False.
4. After iterating through the entire string, check if the stack is empty. If the stack is not empty, there are brackets without a match and we return False. If the stack is empty, all opening brackets have been matched with closing brackets and we return True.

Here's the code for the function:

def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:
    stack = []
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(char)
        elif char == ')':
            if stack and stack[-1] == '(':
                stack.pop()
            else:
                return False
    return not stack


And here are some test cases to verify the correctness of the function:

print(correct_bracketing("("))  # False
print(correct_bracketing("()"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing("(()())"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing(")(()"))  # False
