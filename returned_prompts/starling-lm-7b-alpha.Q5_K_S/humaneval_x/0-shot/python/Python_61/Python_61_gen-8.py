In order to solve this problem, we need to implement a stack data structure.

Here's a step-by-step walkthrough of the solution:

1. Initialize an empty stack.
2. For each bracket in the input string:
  * If the bracket is opening, add it to the stack.
  * If the bracket is closing:
    * If the stack is empty, return False because there is no opening bracket for the closing bracket.
    * If the top of the stack is not an opening bracket that matches the closing bracket, return False because the closing bracket does not have a corresponding opening bracket.
    * Otherwise, remove the opening bracket from the stack.
3. If the stack is not empty, return False because there are opening brackets without corresponding closing brackets. Otherwise, return True.

Here's the Python code that implements the above algorithm:

```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    stack = []
    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket == "(":
            stack.append(bracket)
        elif bracket == ")":
            if not stack:
                return False
            opening_bracket = stack.pop()
            if opening_bracket != "(":
                return False
    return not stack
```

You can use the function like this:

```python
print(correct_bracketing("("))  # False
print(correct_bracketing("()"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing("(()())"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing(")(()"))  # False
```
