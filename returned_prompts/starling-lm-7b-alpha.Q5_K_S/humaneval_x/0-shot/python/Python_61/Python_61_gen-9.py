To solve this problem, we will use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets encountered.

Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Initialize an empty stack.
2. Iterate through the input string.
3. If the current character is an opening bracket ("("), add it to the stack.
4. If the current character is a closing bracket (")"), remove the last element from the stack and check if it is the matching bracket to the current opening bracket. If not, return False.
5. If the stack is empty at the end of the iteration, return True. Otherwise, return False.

Here is the Python code to implement the above algorithm:

```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    stack = []
    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket == "(":
            stack.append(bracket)
        elif bracket == ")":
            if not stack:
                return False
            elif stack[-1] != "(":
                return False
            else:
                stack.pop()
    return not stack
```
This implementation has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string.







```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    """ brackets is a string of "(" and ")".
    return True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

    >>> correct_bracketing("(")
    False
    >>> correct_bracketing("()")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing("(()())")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing(")(()")
    False
    """

    stack = []
    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket == "(":
            stack.append(bracket)
        elif bracket == ")":
            if not stack:
                return False
            elif stack[-1] != "(":
                return False
            else:
                stack.pop()
    return not stack
```

In this implementation, we use a stack to keep track of the opening br
