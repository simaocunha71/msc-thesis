In order to solve this problem, we need to keep track of the number of opening and closing brackets. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to do this:

1. Initialize two counters, one for opening brackets (`open_count`) and one for closing brackets (`close_count`). Set both of them to zero.
2. Iterate through the brackets in the input string. For each opening bracket encountered (i.e., `(`), increment the `open_count` counter by one. For each closing bracket encountered (i.e., `)`), increment the `close_count` counter by one.
3. If at any point `open_count` is greater than `close_count`, it means that there are more opening brackets than closing brackets. In this case, return False, as there can't be a correct bracketing.
4. After iterating through all the brackets, if `open_count` is not equal to `close_count`, return False. If they are equal, return True, as every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

Here's the Python code that implements the above steps:

```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    open_count = close_count = 0
    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket == '(':
            open_count += 1
        elif bracket == ')':
            close_count += 1
        if open_count > close_count:
            return False
    return open_count == close_count
```

You can test the function with the provided test cases to verify that it works correctly:

```python
print(correct_bracketing("("))  # False
print(correct_bracketing("()"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing("(()())"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing(")(()"))  # False
```

The function will return True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and False otherwise.
