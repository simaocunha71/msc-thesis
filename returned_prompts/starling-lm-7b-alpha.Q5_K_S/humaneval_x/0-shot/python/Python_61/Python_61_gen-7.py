In order to solve the problem, you can use the stack data structure. Initialize an empty stack, then iterate through the brackets string. For every opening bracket ("("), push it to the stack. For every closing bracket (")"), pop the top element of the stack. If the closing bracket does not match the most recent opening bracket, return False. If there are opening brackets left in the stack at the end, return False. Otherwise, return True.

Here is a Python implementation of the above algorithm:

def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    stack = []
    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket == '(':
            stack.append(bracket)
        elif bracket == ')':
            if not stack:
                return False
            if stack[-1] == '(':
                stack.pop()
            else:
                return False
    return not stack

This implementation has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the brackets string.
