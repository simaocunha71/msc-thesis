# Here is a solution using Python's built-in collections.Counter
# This takes advantage of the fact that the number of opening and closing
# brackets should be equal if the string is correctly bracketed.
from collections import Counter

def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    # Count the number of opening and closing brackets
    counts = Counter(brackets)
    # If the counts are not equal, the string is not correctly bracketed
    return counts['('] == counts[')']


To test the function, you can use Python's built-in doctest module.
Here's an example of how to create a doctest for the function:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod()
