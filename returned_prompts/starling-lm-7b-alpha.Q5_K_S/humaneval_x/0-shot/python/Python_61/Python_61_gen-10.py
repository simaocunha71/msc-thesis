In order to solve this problem, we need to create a stack and use it to keep track of the opening brackets. We will iterate through the string of brackets and if we find an opening bracket, we will push it to the stack. If we find a closing bracket, we will check if it matches with the top of the stack. If the stack is empty or the closing bracket does not match the top of the stack, we will return False. Once we have iterated through all the brackets, if the stack is empty, we will return True. Otherwise, we will return False.

Here is the code to solve the problem:

def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    stack = []
    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket == "(":
            stack.append(bracket)
        elif bracket == ")":
            if not stack or stack.pop() != "(":
                return False
    return not stack

The function correct_bracketing takes a string of brackets as input and returns True if the bracketing is correct and False otherwise. The function uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. It iterates through the string of brackets and pushes each opening bracket onto the stack. If it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack does not match the closing bracket. If either of these conditions is true, it returns False. If it has iterated through all the brackets and the stack is empty, it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
