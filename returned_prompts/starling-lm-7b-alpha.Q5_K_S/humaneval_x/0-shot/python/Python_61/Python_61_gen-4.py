To solve this problem, you can use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. You will iterate through the string of brackets, and for each opening bracket you find, you will add it to the stack. When you encounter a closing bracket, you will remove the last opening bracket from the stack, and if the stack is empty, you will return False. Otherwise, you will continue iterating through the string. If you reach the end of the string and the stack is not empty, you will return False. Otherwise, you will return True.

Here's a step-by-step guide to implementing the solution:

1. Initialize an empty stack.
2. Iterate through the string of brackets.
3. For each opening bracket, add it to the stack.
4. For each closing bracket, remove the last opening bracket from the stack. If the stack is empty, return False.
5. After iterating through the entire string, if the stack is not empty, return False. Otherwise, return True.

Here's the code that implements the solution:

```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    stack = []
    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket == "(":
            stack.append(bracket)
        elif bracket == ")":
            if not stack:
                return False
            stack.pop()
    return not stack
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string of brackets. It has a space complexity of O(n), as the maximum size of the stack is equal to the length of the string of brackets.











```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    """ brackets is a string of "(" and ")".
    return True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

    >>> correct_bracketing("(")
    False
    >>> correct_bracketing("()")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing("(()())")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing(")(()")
    False
    """
