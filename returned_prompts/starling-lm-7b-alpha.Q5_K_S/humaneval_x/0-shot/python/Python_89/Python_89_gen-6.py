To solve this problem, we need to implement a function called `encrypt` that takes a string `s` as an argument and returns a string that is encrypted using a rotated alphabet. The rotation should shift the letters down by two multiplied by two places. 

Here is one possible solution:

```python
def encrypt(s):
    # Initialize an empty string to store the encrypted result
    result = ""

    # Iterate through each character in the input string
    for char in s:
        # Convert the character to its corresponding ASCII code
        ascii_code = ord(char)

        # Rotate the character by two multiplied by two places
        rotated_ascii_code = (ascii_code - 2 * 2) % 97

        # Convert the rotated ASCII code back to a character
        result += chr(rotated_ascii_code)

    return result
```

This solution works by iterating through each character in the input string and converting it to its corresponding ASCII code. Then, it rotates the ASCII code by two multiplied by two places and converts it back to a character. Finally, it appends the rotated character to the result string. 

For example, if we call the function with `encrypt('hi')`, it will return 'lm' because 'h' is rotated to 'l' and 'i' is rotated to 'm'. 

Similarly, if we call the function with `encrypt('asdfghjkl')`, it will return 'ewhjklnop' because 'a' is rotated to 'e', 's' is rotated to 'w', 'd' is rotated to 'h', 'f' is rotated to 'j', 'g' is rotated to 'k', 'h' is rotated to 'l', 'j' is rotated to 'n', 'k' is rotated to 'o', and 'l' is rotated to 'p'. 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.
