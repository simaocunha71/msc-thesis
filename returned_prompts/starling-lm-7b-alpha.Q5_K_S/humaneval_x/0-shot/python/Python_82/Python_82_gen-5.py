To determine if the length of a string is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. We define a function called `prime_length` that takes a string as an argument.
2. We convert the length of the string to an integer using the `len()` function.
3. We define a function called `is_prime` that takes an integer `n` as an argument. This function will determine if `n` is a prime number.
4. In the `is_prime` function, we start by checking if `n` is less than or equal to 1. If it is, we immediately return `False` because prime numbers are greater than 1.
5. Next, we use a `for` loop to iterate over a range from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). We use the `int()` function to convert the range end to an integer because the range end is a float by default.
6. Inside the loop, we check if `n` is divisible by the current number (`i`). If it is, we return `False` because `n` is not a prime number.
7. After the loop, if we haven't returned `False` yet, we return `True` because no divisors other than 1 and `n` have been found, meaning that `n` is a prime number.
8. Finally, we use the `is_prime` function to check if the length of the input string is a prime number. If it is, we return `True`; otherwise, we return `False`.

Here's the code:

```python
def prime_length(string):
    length = len(string)
    def is_prime(n):
        if n <= 1:
            return False
        for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
            if n % i == 0:
                return False
        return True
    return is_prime(length)
```

You can use this function to check if the length of a string is a prime number. For example:

```python
print(prime_length('Hello'))  #
