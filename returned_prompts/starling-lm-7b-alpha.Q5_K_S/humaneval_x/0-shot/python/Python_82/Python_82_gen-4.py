To solve this problem, we need to check if the length of the string is a prime number. A prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself. We can start by defining a helper function called `is_prime` to check if a number is prime. This function will take a number as input and return True if the number is prime, and False otherwise.

Here's a Python implementation of the `is_prime` function:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

In this function, we first check if the input number `n` is less than or equal to 1. If it is, we return False, as 1 and 0 are not prime numbers. Then, we use a `for` loop to iterate from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). We check if `n` is divisible by any number in this range. If it is, we return False, as it is not a prime number. If no divisors are found, we return True, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

Now, we can use the `is_prime` function to check if the length of the string is a prime number. Here's a Python implementation of the `prime_length` function:

```python
def prime_length(string):
    length = len(string)
    return is_prime(length)
```

In this function, we first calculate the length of the input string using the `len()` function. Then, we pass this length to the `is_prime` function to check if it is a prime number. The function returns True if the length is a prime number, and False otherwise.

You can use the `prime_length` function to check if the length of a string is a prime number. For example:

```python
print(prime_length('Hello'))  # Output: True
print(prime_length('abcdcba'))  # Output: True
print(prime_length('kittens'))  # Output: True
print(prime_length
