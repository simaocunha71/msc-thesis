# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Space Complexity: O(1)


# The time complexity of this function is O(n) because we are iterating over the entire input list once.
# The space complexity of this function is O(1) because the only extra space we are using is the single variable "sum" to store the result.


# Note: This solution assumes that the input list is a list of integers. If the input list can contain any type of elements, we need to modify the function to check if the element is an integer and ignore non-integers.



# Another way to solve this problem is to use list comprehension and built-in Python functions. Here is an alternative solution that uses list comprehension and the built-in Python function sum():


def double_the_difference(lst):
    # Filter the odd integers from the list
    odd_integers = [i for i in lst if i % 2 != 0 and isinstance(i, int)]
    # Square the odd integers and sum them
    result = sum([i ** 2 for i in odd_integers])
    # Return the result
    return result

# Test the function
print(double_the_difference([1, 3, 2, 0]))  # Output: 10
print(double_the_difference([-1, -
