# Test the function
print(double_the_difference([1, 3, 2, 0])) # Output: 10
print(double_the_difference([-1, -2, 0])) # Output: 0
print(double_the_difference([9, -2])) # Output: 81
print(double_the_difference([0])) # Output: 0
print(double_the_difference([])) # Output: 0


# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(1)
# The time complexity is O(n) because we need to iterate through the list once.
# The space complexity is O(1) because we only use a single variable to store the sum.

# Stability: The function is stable as it does not sort or modify the original list.
# It simply iterates through the list and calculates the sum of squares of the odd numbers.

# Test cases:
# double_the_difference([1, 3, 2, 0]) # Output: 10
# double_the_difference([-1, -2, 0]) # Output: 0
# double_the_difference([9, -2]) # Output: 81
# double_the_difference([0]) # Output: 0
# double_the_difference([]) # Output: 0

# Edge cases:
# double_the_difference([0]) # Output: 0
# double_the_difference([]) # Output: 0

# The function correctly handles edge cases, including an empty list and a list with only zeroes.
# It also correctly handles negative numbers and non-integer inputs, ignoring them and not including them in the sum.
