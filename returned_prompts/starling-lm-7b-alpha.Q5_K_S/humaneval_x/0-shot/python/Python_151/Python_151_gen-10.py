# Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the list. We are iterating over the list once. 
# Space Complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra data structure to store the elements of the array.

# Stability in Python: Python lists are not stable. i.e, the order of elements in the list can change. 
# Here, we are not sorting or modifying the original list. So, the stability does not play a role here. 

# In-place modification: Yes, as we are modifying the values of the elements in the list itself. 

# External Sorting: No, as the given problem does not require sorting of the elements in the list. 

# Online Algorithm: No, as we need the whole list to calculate the sum of squares of odd numbers and then multiply it by 2. 

# Lower Bound: Yes, as we are finding the lower bound of the list which are the elements that are odd. 

# Upper Bound: No, as we are not finding
