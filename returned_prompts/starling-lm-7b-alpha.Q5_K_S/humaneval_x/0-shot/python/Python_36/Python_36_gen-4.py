To solve this problem, we need to count the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n, which are divisible by 11 or 13.

We can start by creating a function that checks if a number is divisible by 11 or 13. Then, we can iterate through all the numbers less than n that are divisible by either 11 or 13. For each of these numbers, we can check if the number contains the digit 7. If it does, we increment a counter. Finally, we return the counter, which represents the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n, which are divisible by 11 or 13.

Here's the code to implement this solution:

```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:
            if '7' in str(i):
                count += 1
    return count
```

You can test the function using the provided test cases:

```python
print(fizz_buzz(50))  # Output: 0
print(fizz_buzz(78))  # Output: 2
print(fizz_buzz(79))  # Output: 3
```

The function `fizz_buzz` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than `n` which are divisible by 11 or 13.

In the implementation, we initialize a counter variable `count` to 0. Then, we iterate through all the numbers from 1 to `n-1` using a `for` loop. For each number, we check if it is divisible by either 11 or 13 using the modulo operator `%`. If it is, we convert the number to a string using the `str()` function and check if the digit 7 is present in the string representation of the number. If it is, we increment the counter. Finally, we return the counter, which represents the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less
