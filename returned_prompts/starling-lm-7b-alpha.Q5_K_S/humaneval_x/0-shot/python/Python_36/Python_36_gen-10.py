Here is a simple solution for this problem:

def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:
            if '7' in str(i):
                count += 1
    return count


This solution works by iterating over all integers less than n. If an integer is divisible by 11 or 13, we check if it contains the digit 7, and increment the count if it does.

Here's a breakdown of the solution's logic:

- We initialize a counter variable, count, to keep track of the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers divisible by 11 or 13.
- We use a for loop to iterate over all integers less than n.
- Inside the loop, we use the modulo operator (%) to check if the current integer is divisible by 11 or 13. If it is, we proceed to the next step.
- We convert the current integer to a string and check if it contains the digit 7 using the 'in' keyword. If it does, we increment the count variable.
- After the loop finishes, we return the final value of the count variable, which represents the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) since it iterates over all integers less than n. The space complexity is O(1) as we only use a single variable, count, to store the result.

This solution should correctly calculate the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13, as per the requirements of the problem.
