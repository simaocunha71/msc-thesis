Here is a solution to your problem:

To encode a string by shifting every character by 5 in the alphabet, you can use the following function:

```python
def encode_shift(s: str):
    """
    returns encoded string by shifting every character by 5 in the alphabet.
    """
    return "".join([chr(((ord(ch) + 5 - ord("a")) % 26) + ord("a")) for ch in s])
```

This function takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string with each character shifted by 5 positions in the alphabet. It uses the `ord()` and `chr()` functions to convert between ASCII values and characters. The `% 26` operation ensures that the shifting wraps around the alphabet if necessary (e.g., shifting 'z' will result in 'c').

To decode a string that has been encoded with the `encode_shift` function, you can use the following function:

```python
def decode_shift(s: str):
    """
    takes as input string encoded with encode_shift function. Returns decoded string.
    """

    return "".join([chr(((ord(ch) - 5 + ord("a")) % 26) + ord("a")) for ch in s])
```

This function takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string with each character shifted back by 5 positions in the alphabet. It uses the same `ord()` and `chr()` functions as the encoding function. Again, the `% 26` operation ensures that the shifting wraps around the alphabet if necessary.

To use these functions, you can simply call them with the string you want to encode or decode. For example:

```python
encoded_string = encode_shift("Hello, world!")
print(encoded_string)  # Output: "Mjqqt, btwqi!"

decoded_string = decode_shift("Mjqqt, btwqi!")
print(decoded_string)  # Output: "Hello, world!"
```

In this example, we encode the string "Hello, world!" with the `encode_shift` function, which results in
