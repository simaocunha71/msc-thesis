In the function encode_shift, we are shifting every character of the string s by 5 in the alphabet. We are using ord() function to get the ascii value of the character and then adding 5 to it and then taking modulus of 26 to ensure that it remains in the range of alphabets. Finally, we are adding the ascii value of "a" to ensure that the shifted character is an alphabet and then using chr() function to convert it back into character.
In the function decode_shift, we are doing the reverse process. We are subtracting 5 from the ascii value of the character and then taking modulus of 26 to ensure that it remains in the range of alphabets. Finally, we are subtracting the ascii value of "a" to ensure that the decoded character is an alphabet and then using chr() function to convert it back into character.

Here is the step by step process:

1. The encode_shift function takes a string as input and returns a new string after shifting every character by 5 in the alphabet.
2. Inside the function, we use a list comprehension to iterate through each character in the input string.
3. For each character, we use the ord() function to get its ascii value and add 5 to it.
4. We then take the modulus of 26 to ensure that the shifted character remains within the range of alphabets.
5. After that, we add the ascii value of "a" to the shifted character to ensure that it is an alphabet.
6. Finally, we use the chr() function to convert the shifted ascii value back into a character and join all the characters to form a new string.
7. The decode_shift function takes a string as input and returns a new string after shifting every character back by 5 in the alphabet.
8. Inside the function, we use a list comprehension to iterate through each character in the input string.
9. For each character, we use the ord() function to get its ascii value and subtract 5 from it.
10. We then take the modulus of 26 to ensure that the decoded character remains within the range of alphabets.
11. After that, we subtract the
