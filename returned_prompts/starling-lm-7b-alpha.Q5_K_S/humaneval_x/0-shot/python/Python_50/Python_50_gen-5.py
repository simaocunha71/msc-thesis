In order to solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Define a function called encode_shift that takes a string as input and returns the encoded string by shifting every character by 5 in the alphabet. We can achieve this by using the ord() function to get the Unicode value of each character, adding 5 to it, taking the modulus of 26 to ensure the shift stays within the alphabet range, and then converting the Unicode value back to a character using the chr() function. We can join all the characters back together using the join() function.

2. Define a function called decode_shift that takes a string as input and returns the decoded string. We can achieve this by reversing the steps in the encode_shift function. We can use the ord() function to get the Unicode value of each character, subtracting 5 from it, taking the modulus of 26 to ensure the shift stays within the alphabet range, and then converting the Unicode value back to a character using the chr() function. We can join all the characters back together using the join() function.

Here is the code for the functions:

```python
def encode_shift(s: str):
    return "".join([chr(((ord(ch) + 5 - ord("a")) % 26) + ord("a")) for ch in s])

def decode_shift(s: str):
    return "".join([chr(((ord(ch) - 5 + ord("a")) % 26) + ord("a")) for ch in s])
```

To use these functions, you can simply call them with a string as input. For example:

```python
print(encode_shift("hello"))  # Output: "mjqqt"
print(decode_shift("mjqqt"))  # Output: "hello"
```

The encode_shift function will shift each character in the input string by 5 in the alphabet, and the decode_shift function will reverse this process to get the original string back.

Note that these functions assume that the input string only contains lowercase letters. If you need to support uppercase letters or other characters, you can modify the functions accordingly.

```python
def encode_shift(s: str):
