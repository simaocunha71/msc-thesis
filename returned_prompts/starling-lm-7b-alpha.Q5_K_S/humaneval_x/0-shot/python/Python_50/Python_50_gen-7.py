Here's a simple Python program that defines two functions `encode_shift` and `decode_shift` for encoding and decoding strings using a Caesar cipher with a shift of 5.

To encode a string using the `encode_shift` function, you can pass the string as an argument to the function. The function will then return the encoded string by shifting each character in the string by 5 positions in the alphabet. The `chr` and `ord` functions are used to convert the Unicode code point of each character to a character and back again.

To decode a string that has been encoded using the `encode_shift` function, you can pass the encoded string as an argument to the `decode_shift` function. The function will then return the decoded string by shifting each character in the string back by 5 positions in the alphabet.

Here's an example usage of the functions:

```python
encoded_string = encode_shift("Hello, World!")
print(encoded_string)  # Output: "Mjqqt, Btwqi!"

decoded_string = decode_shift("Mjqqt, Btwqi!")
print(decoded_string)  # Output: "Hello, World!"
```

In this example, the string "Hello, World!" is encoded using the `encode_shift` function, which returns the encoded string "Mjqqt, Btwqi!". The `decode_shift` function is then used to decode the encoded string, which returns the original string "Hello, World!".

The `chr` function is used to convert the Unicode code point of each character to a character, and the `ord` function is used to convert a character back to its Unicode code point. The `%` operator is used to calculate the modulo of the division of the Unicode code point of each character by 26, which is the number of letters in the alphabet. This ensures that the shift wraps around if it exceeds the range of the alphabet.

Overall, this program provides a simple way to encode and decode strings using a Caesar cipher with a shift of 5 in the alphabet.
