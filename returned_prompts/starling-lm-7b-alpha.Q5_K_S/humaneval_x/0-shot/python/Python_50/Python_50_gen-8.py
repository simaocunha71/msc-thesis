In the `encode_shift` function, we take a string `s` as input. We use a list comprehension to iterate over each character `ch` in the string. We shift each character by 5 in the alphabet by adding `5` to the `ord(ch)` value, then subtracting the `ord("a")` value to keep it within the range of lowercase alphabets. We then use the modulo operator `%` with `26` to ensure the character wraps around if it exceeds the range of alphabets. Finally, we convert the shifted character back to a string using the `chr` function and join all the characters back together using the `"".join()` method.

In the `decode_shift` function, we take a string `s` as input. We assume that the string has been encoded using the `encode_shift` function. We use a similar approach as in the `encode_shift` function, but this time we subtract `5` from the `ord(ch)` value to shift each character back by 5 in the alphabet. We then use the modulo operator `%` with `26` to ensure the character wraps around if it falls below the range of alphabets. Finally, we convert the shifted character back to a string using the `chr` function and join all the characters back together using the `"".join()` method.

To use these functions, you can simply call them with a string argument. For example, to encode a string with the `encode_shift` function, you can call `encode_shift("hello")`. This will return the encoded string "mjqqt". To decode a string with the `decode_shift` function, you can call `decode_shift("mjqqt")`. This will return the decoded string "hello".

Here's an example of how you can use these functions in Python:

```python
encoded_string = encode_shift("hello")
print(encoded_string)  # Output: "mjqqt"

decoded_string = decode_shift("mjqqt")
print(decoded_string)  # Output: "hello"
```

Note that the `encode_shift` function can only be used to encode a string, and the `decode
