Here are the answers to your questions:

1. The encode_shift function shifts every character in the string by 5 in the alphabet. It does this by using the ord() function to get the Unicode code point of each character, adding 5, taking modulo 26 to ensure the shift doesn't go beyond the alphabet, and then converting the code point back to a character using chr(). The result is joined into a string using "".join().

2. The decode_shift function takes as input a string that has been encoded using the encode_shift function. It reverses the encoding process by subtracting 5 from each character's Unicode code point, taking modulo 26 to undo the shift, and then converting the code point back to a character. The result is joined into a string using "".join().

Here's an example of how to use these functions:

```python
encoded_string = encode_shift("hello")
print(encoded_string)  # Output: "mjqqt"

decoded_string = decode_shift(encoded_string)
print(decoded_string)  # Output: "hello"
```

In this example, the original string "hello" is encoded as "mjqqt" and then decoded back to "hello".

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.
