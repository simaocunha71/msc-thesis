The function common(l1, l2) takes two lists as input and returns a sorted unique common element for the two lists. It does this by first converting both lists to sets to remove any duplicates. Then, it uses the intersection operator (&) to find the common elements between the two sets. Finally, it converts the resulting set back to a list and sorts it in ascending order using the sorted() function.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. The function common(l1, l2) takes two lists, l1 and l2, as input.
2. It converts both lists to sets using the set() function. This removes any duplicate elements from the lists.
3. It finds the intersection of the two sets using the & operator. This gives us a set of unique common elements between the two lists.
4. It converts the resulting set back to a list using the list() function.
5. Finally, it sorts the list in ascending order using the sorted() function and returns the sorted list as the output.

You can test the function by running the provided doctest cases. The first case checks if the function correctly returns the sorted unique common elements for the given input lists. The second case checks if the function correctly returns the sorted unique common elements for the given input lists.

Here's an example usage of the function:

common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121])  # Returns [1, 5, 653]
common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2])  # Returns [2, 3]

These examples show how you can use the common() function to find the sorted unique common elements for two lists.
