def add_elements(arr, k):
    return sum([i for i in arr[:k] if len(str(i)) <= 2])

# Time Complexity: O(n + k)
# Space Complexity: O(1)

# Here's an explanation of the solution:

# The solution first initializes an empty list called `arr`. Then, it iterates through each element in the input array `arr` using a for loop. For each element, it checks if the length of the string representation of the element (i.e., `len(str(i))`) is less than or equal to 2. If it is, the element is added to the `arr` list. Finally, the sum of all elements in the `arr` list is returned.

# The time complexity of this solution is O(n + k), where n is the length of the input array `arr` and k is the value of the `k` parameter. This is because the solution iterates through each element in the `arr` array and checks the length of each element, which takes O(n) time. Additionally, the solution also iterates through the first k elements of the `arr` array, which takes O(k) time. Therefore, the total time complexity is O(n + k).

# The space complexity of this solution is O(1), which means that the amount of space used by the solution does not grow with the size of the input array `arr` or the value of the `k` parameter. This is because the solution only uses a fixed amount of space to store the `arr` list, regardless of the size of the input array or the value of `k`.

# Overall, this solution is efficient and has a low space complexity, making it a good choice for solving the given problem.

# Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

# 1. The solution defines a function called `add_elements` that takes two parameters: `arr`, which is the input array of integers, and `k`, which is the integer value to use as a limit for the number of elements to consider.

# 2. Inside the function, a new list called `arr` is initialized as an empty list. This list will store the elements that satisfy the condition of having at most two digits.
