The function `sort_third` takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list `l'` with the same values at indices that are not divisible by three, while the values at indices that are divisible by three are sorted in ascending order. Here's how the function works:

1. It initializes an empty list `l'` to store the sorted values at indices divisible by three.
2. It loops through the indices of `l` using the `range` function. For each index `i`, it checks if `i` is divisible by three using the modulo operator `%`.
3. If `i` is not divisible by three, it appends the value at index `i` in `l` directly to `l'`.
4. If `i` is divisible by three, it appends the sorted value at index `i` in `l` to `l'`. It uses the `sorted` function to sort the values and selects the first value using `[0]`.
5. Finally, it returns the resulting list `l'`.

The provided examples demonstrate the usage of the `sort_third` function. In the first example, the input list `[1, 2, 3]` is unchanged as none of its indices are divisible by three. In the second example, the values at indices 3, 6, and 9 (which are divisible by three) are sorted in ascending order, resulting in the output `[2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]`.

You can use this `sort_third` function in your Python program to sort the values at indices divisible by three while keeping the other values unchanged.
