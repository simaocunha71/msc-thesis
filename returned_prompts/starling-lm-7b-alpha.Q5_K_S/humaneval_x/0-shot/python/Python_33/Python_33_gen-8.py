The function `sort_third` takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list `l'` such that `l'` is identical to `l` in the indices that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal to the values of the corresponding indices of `l`, but sorted.

To achieve this, the function iterates over the indices of `l` using the `enumerate` function. For each index `i`, the function checks if `i` is divisible by three using the modulo operator `%`. If `i` is divisible by three, it appends the sorted value of `l[i]` to the new list `l'`. If `i` is not divisible by three, it appends the value of `l[i]` as it is. Finally, the function returns the new list `l'`.

The function uses the `sorted` function to sort the values of `l` at the indices that are divisible by three. The `sorted` function returns a new list containing the sorted values of the input list.

The provided examples demonstrate the usage of the `sort_third` function. In the first example, the function is called with the list `[1, 2, 3]`, and it returns the same list `[1, 2, 3]` as there are no indices divisible by three. In the second example, the function is called with the list `[5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]`. The indices divisible by three are `3` and `6`, so the function sorts the values `3` and `8` and returns the new list `[2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]`.

Overall, the `sort_third` function provides a way to modify a list by sorting specific elements while leaving the rest of the list unchanged.

Note: The code provided in the solution is written in Python, as indicated by the usage of Python-specific syntax and functions such as `enumerate`, `%`, and `sorted`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Define the `sort_third` function that takes a list `l` as input.
