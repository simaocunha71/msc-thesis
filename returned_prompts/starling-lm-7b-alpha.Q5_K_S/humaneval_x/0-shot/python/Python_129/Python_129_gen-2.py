To solve this problem, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path in the grid. We can use a queue to keep track of the cells we need to visit, and we can use a set to keep track of the cells we have already visited. We can also keep track of the minimum path so far using a list.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize the queue with the starting cell (0, 0) and the set with the starting cell.
2. While the queue is not empty, do the following:
   a. Remove the first cell from the queue (this will be the next cell to visit).
   b. If the length of the minimum path is equal to k, return the minimum path.
   c. Generate the neighbors of the current cell. Each neighbor will be a tuple of (row, col) coordinates.
   d. For each neighbor, check if it is within the grid boundaries and if it has not been visited before. If it satisfies these conditions, add it to the queue and the set of visited cells.
   e. Add the value of the current cell to the minimum path list.
3. If the while loop finishes without finding a minimum path of length k, return an empty list.

Here's a Python implementation of the solution:

```python
from collections import deque

def minPath(grid, k):
    N = len(grid)
    queue = deque([(0, 0)])
    visited = {(0, 0)}
    min_path = []
    
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        
        if len(min_path) == k:
            return min_path
        
        neighbors = [(x+dx, y+dy) for dx, dy in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]]
        
        for nx, ny in neighbors:
            if 0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N and (nx, ny) not in visited:
                queue.append((nx, ny))
                visited.add((nx, ny))
                min_path.append
