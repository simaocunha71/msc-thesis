To solve this problem, we can use a BFS (breadth-first search) approach. We will start from each cell in the grid and perform a BFS until we find a path with length k. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. Create a set called visited to keep track of the visited cells in the grid.

2. Initialize a queue called q with all the coordinates of the grid.

3. While the queue q is not empty, perform the following steps:
   a. Dequeue the first coordinate from q and assign it to cur.
   b. If the length of the path from cur to the previous cell is equal to k,
      return the values in the path in increasing order. This is because we have found a path with length k.
   c. Check if cur is not in the visited set and cur is not the starting cell. If these conditions are met, add cur to the visited set, append the value of cur to the path, and enqueue the neighbors of cur to q.

4. If we reach this point, it means that there is no path with length k in the grid. In this case, return an empty list.

Here is the Python code that implements the above steps:

```python
from collections import deque

def minPath(grid, k):
    visited = set()
    q = deque(grid)
    path = []

    while q:
        cur = q.popleft()
        if len(path) == k:
            return path
        if cur not in visited and cur != 0:
            visited.add(cur)
            path.append(grid[cur])
            for nei in [(cur-1, 0), (cur+1, 0), (cur, 1)]:
                q.append(nei[0] * len(grid) + nei[1])
    return []
```

In the code, we start by initializing the visited set with all the coordinates in the grid. Then, we use a while loop to continue until the queue q is empty. Inside the loop, we dequeue the first coordinate from q and assign it to cur. If the length of the path from cur to the previous cell is equal to k, we return the values in
