Here are some comments to the solution:

1. It is important to use the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm in this problem since the path length is k. The BFS algorithm can find all the possible paths of length k.
2. To ensure the result is unique, we can use the lexicographically method to compare the paths. The lexicographically method can find the smallest path.
3. It is necessary to keep track of the visited cells to avoid repeating the cells. We use a boolean 2D array visited to record the visited cells.
4. The grid can be considered as a matrix, so we can use two pointers to traverse the grid.

Here is the Python implementation of the solution:

```
from collections import deque

def minPath(grid, k):
    """
    :type grid: List[List[int]]
    :type k: int
    :rtype: List[int]
    """
    def lexi(path1, path2):
        for i in range(min(len(path1), len(path2))):
            if path1[i] != path2[i]:
                return path1[i] < path2[i]
        return len(path1) < len(path2)

    visited = [[False] * len(grid[0]) for _ in range(len(grid))]
    queue = deque([(0,0,[grid[0][0]])])
    while queue:
        x, y, path = queue.popleft()
        if visited[x][y]:
            continue
        visited[x][y] = True
        if len(path) == k:
            return path
        for dx, dy in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and not visited[nx][ny]:
                queue.append((nx, ny, path + [grid[nx][ny]]))
    return path
```

The time complexity of this solution is O(N^2
