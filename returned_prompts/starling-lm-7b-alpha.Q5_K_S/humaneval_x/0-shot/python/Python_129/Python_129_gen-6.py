We can solve the problem in O(N^3) time.

Here are the steps:

1. First, we can use a sliding window to find the lexicographically smallest path of length k for each grid cell.
2. Then, we can use a sliding window to find the lexicographically smallest path of length k for each row/col of the grid.
3. Finally, we can use a sliding window to find the lexicographically smallest path of length k for each path of length k on the grid.
4. We can then return the result.

Here are the steps in detail:

1. First, we can use a sliding window to find the lexicographically smallest path of length k for each grid cell.

We can use a sliding window to find the lexicographically smallest path of length k for each grid cell by sliding a window of size k over the grid and comparing the values of the cells in the window to find the lexicographically smallest path of length k.

Here's an example of how to do this:

```python
def minPath(grid, k):
    # Initialize the result
    result = []

    # Slide a window of size k over the grid
    for i in range(len(grid)):
        for j in range(len(grid)):
            # Find the lexicographically smallest path of length k for each grid cell
            path = []
            for d in range(k):
                path.append(grid[i + d // len(grid)][j + d % len(grid)])
            result.append(path)
```

2. Then, we can use a sliding window to find the lexicographically smallest path of length k for each row/col of the grid.

We can use a sliding window to find the lexicographically smallest path of length k for each row/col of the grid by sliding a window of size k over the grid and comparing the values of the cells in the window to find the lexicographically smallest path of length k.

Here's an example of how to do this:

```python
def minPath(grid, k):
    # Initialize the result
    result = []

    # Slide a window of size k over the grid
