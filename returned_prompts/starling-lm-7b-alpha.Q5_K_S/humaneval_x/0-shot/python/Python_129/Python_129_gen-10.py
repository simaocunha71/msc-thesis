Here are some insights to help you solve the problem:

1. The problem can be reduced to finding the minimum path of length k in a grid with the size of N * N, which contains the values 1 to k.
2. The minimum path of length k in a grid with the size of N * N, which contains the values 1 to k, is equivalent to finding the minimum path of length (k - 1) in a grid with the size of (N - 1) * (N - 1), which contains the values 2 to k. This is because the first cell in the grid with the size of N * N, which contains the values 1 to k, will always be included in the minimum path of length k, regardless of the path.
3. Based on the above insights, we can use a recursive approach to find the minimum path. We can start with a grid of size (N - 1) * (N - 1) with the values 2 to k, and recursively find the minimum path of length (k - 1) in this grid. Then, we can append the value 1 to the minimum path to get the minimum path of length k in the original grid.
4. Here is a detailed step-by-step solution to the problem:

    Step 1: Define a function called `minPath` that takes in the grid and the length of the path as parameters.
    Step 2: Check if the length of the path is equal to 1. If it is, return a list with the value at the current cell in the grid.
    Step 3: Check if the length of the path is equal to 2. If it is, return a list with the minimum value in the grid and the value at the current cell.
    Step 4: Recursively call the `minPath` function with the grid and the length of the path minus 2, and get the minimum path.
    Step 5: Append the value at the current cell in the grid to the minimum path.
    Step 6: Return the minimum path.

Here is the Python code for the solution:

```python
def minPath(grid, k):
    if k == 1:
        return [grid[0][0]]
    elif k == 2:
        min_value = min(
