Here is an efficient solution with time complexity O(N^3) and space complexity O(N^2).

We can use a bfs to find the shortest path of length k from every cell. Then we sort all these paths by the first number in them, and pick the one with the smallest first number.

Here is the Python implementation:

```
from collections import deque

class Solution(object):
    def minPath(self, grid, k):
        """
        :type grid: List[List[int]]
        :type k: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
        def bfs(grid, k, i, j):
            q = deque([(i, j)])
            visited = [[False]*len(grid[0]) for _ in range(len(grid))]
            visited[i][j] = True
            while q:
                i, j = q.popleft()
                if len(q) == k:
                    return q
                for dx, dy in directions:
                    x, y = i+dx, j+dy
                    if not (0 <= x < len(grid) and 0 <= y < len(grid[0]) and
                            not visited[x][y] and grid[x][y] != -1):
                        continue
                    visited[x][y] = True
                    q.append((x, y))
            return []

        result = []
        for i in xrange(len(grid)):
            for j in xrange(len(grid[0])):
                grid[i][j] = -1 if i == j == 0 else grid[i][j]
                path = bfs(grid, k, i, j)
                if path:
                    result.append(path)
        result = min(result, key = lambda x: x[0])
        return result
```

The key idea is to use a bfs to find the shortest path from every cell. If the length of the path is equal to k, we
