To solve this problem, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. We will start from every cell of the grid and explore all possible paths of length k. We will keep track of the path and its length, and whenever the length of the path is equal to k, we will check if the path is lexicographically smaller than any other path of length k that we have found so far. If it is, we will update our answer to be the current path. Otherwise, we will continue exploring other paths.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. Create a queue and add all the cells of the grid to it. This will be our starting point for the BFS.
2. Initialize an empty list called `result` to store the paths of length k that we find.
3. While the queue is not empty, perform the following steps:
    - Dequeue a cell from the queue. Let's call this cell `cur`.
    - If the length of the path from the starting cell to `cur` is equal to k, add the path to the `result` list and continue to the next iteration of the loop.
    - If the length of the path from the starting cell to `cur` is less than k, explore all the neighboring cells of `cur`. For each neighboring cell, create a new path by appending the value of the neighboring cell to the current path. If the value of the neighboring cell is not in the `result` list, add the new path to the queue and the `result` list. If the value of the neighboring cell is already in the `result` list, compare the new path with the path in the `result` list that has the same value. If the new path is lexicographically smaller, update the `result` list with the new path. If the new path is not smaller, continue to the next neighboring cell.
4. After the BFS is complete, return the `result` list.

The time complexity of this solution is O(N^2 * K), where N is the number of rows/columns in the grid and K is the length of the path. This is because we need to explore all possible paths of length k in the grid, and each path can have a length of up to k.

The space complexity of this solution is also
