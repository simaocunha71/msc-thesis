To solve this problem, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find all the shortest paths of length k in the grid. Then, we can find the lexicographically smallest path among them.

Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Initialize a queue with the starting cell of the grid.
2. Initialize an empty list to store the shortest paths of length k.
3. While the queue is not empty:
   a. Pop the leftmost cell from the queue.
   b. If the length of the current path is equal to k, add the current path to the list of shortest paths.
   c. Otherwise, generate all the neighboring cells of the current cell and add them to the queue. For each neighboring cell, append the value of the current cell to its path.
4. Sort the list of shortest paths in lexicographic order.
5. Return the lexicographically smallest path.

Here is an implementation of the above steps in Python:

```python
from collections import deque

def minPath(grid, k):
    N = len(grid)
    queue = deque([(0, 0, [grid[0][0]])])  # (row, col, path)
    shortest_paths = []
    while queue:
        row, col, path = queue.popleft()
        if len(path) == k:
            shortest_paths.append(path)
        else:
            for neighbor in [(row + 1, col), (row - 1, col), (row, col + 1), (row, col - 1)]:
                if 0 <= neighbor[0] < N and 0 <= neighbor[1] < N:
                    queue.append((neighbor[0], neighbor[1], path + [grid[neighbor[0]][neighbor[1]]]))
    return min(shortest_paths)
```

The time complexity of this solution is O(N^2 * k) because we need to visit each cell in the grid at most once and the length of each path is k. The space complexity is also O(N^2 * k) because we need to store all the shortest paths of length k.
