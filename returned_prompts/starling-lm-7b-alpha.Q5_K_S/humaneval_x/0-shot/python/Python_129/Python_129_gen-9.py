To solve this problem, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find all the paths of length k in the grid. Then, we can find the lexicographically smallest path among all the paths.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. Create a set to store the cells that have been visited during the BFS.
2. Create a dictionary to store the distances from each cell to the starting cell. Initialize all the distances to infinity, except for the starting cell, which is initialized to 0.
3. Use BFS to find all the paths of length k in the grid:
   a. Enqueue the starting cell into the queue.
   b. While the queue is not empty:
      i. Dequeue a cell from the queue.
      ii. Check all the neighboring cells:
           1. If the neighboring cell has not been visited, enqueue it into the queue with a distance equal to the distance of the current cell plus 1.
           2. If the neighboring cell has been visited and its distance is equal to the distance of the current cell plus 1, update the distance of the neighboring cell to the current cell's distance.
4. Create a set to store the unique values among all the paths of length k.
5. Find the lexicographically smallest path among all the paths by iterating over all the paths and selecting the minimum value at each index.
6. Return the lexicographically smallest path.

Here's the Python code for the solution:

```python
from collections import deque

def minPath(grid, k):
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    visited = set()
    distances = {(0, 0): 0}
    queue = deque([(0, 0)])

    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        if (x, y) not in visited:
            visited.add((x, y))
            for dx, dy in directions:
                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny <
