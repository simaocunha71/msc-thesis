The `filter_by_prefix` function takes a list of strings and a prefix as input. It uses list comprehension to filter the list of strings to only include strings that start with the given prefix. The function returns a new list containing only the strings that start with the prefix.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. The function `filter_by_prefix` takes two parameters: `strings` (the input list of strings) and `prefix` (the prefix to filter the strings).

2. Inside the function, a list comprehension is used to create a new list. The comprehension iterates over each string in the `strings` list and checks if the string starts with the given `prefix`. If it does, the string is added to the new list.

3. The list comprehension syntax `[s for s in strings if s.startswith(prefix)]` means "for each string `s` in the `strings` list, check if `s` starts with the `prefix` and if so, add `s` to the new list".

4. Finally, the function returns the new list containing only the strings that start with the given prefix.

To use the `filter_by_prefix` function, you can pass in a list of strings and the desired prefix as arguments. The function will return a new list containing only the strings that start with the prefix.

For example, if you call `filter_by_prefix([], 'a')`, it will return an empty list because there are no strings in the input list. If you call `filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a')`, it will return `['abc', 'array']` because only these two strings start with the prefix 'a'.

Overall, the `filter_by_prefix` function provides a convenient way to filter a list of strings based on a given prefix.

from typing import List


def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Filter an input list of strings only for ones that start with a given prefix.

    >>> filter_by_prefix([], 'a')
