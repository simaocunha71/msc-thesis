In this problem, we need to define a function f that takes a parameter n and returns a list of size n. The value of the element at index i is the factorial of i if i is even, otherwise it is the sum of the numbers from 1 to i.

We can define another function fact that calculates the factorial of a number n. This function uses recursion to calculate the factorial. If the number n is 0, it returns 1, otherwise it multiplies n with the factorial of n - 1.

We can also define another function sum_numbers that calculates the sum of the numbers from 1 to n. This function also uses recursion. If the number n is 1, it returns 1, otherwise it adds n to the sum of the numbers from 1 to n - 1.

Finally, in the function f, we use a loop to iterate from 1 to n. For each number i, if it is even, we append the result of the function fact(i) to the result list, otherwise we append the result of the function sum_numbers(i). After iterating all the numbers, we return the result list.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), as we only need to iterate from 1 to n once.

The space complexity is also O(n), as the maximum length of the result list is n.

In the test, we call the function f with the parameter 5 and print the
