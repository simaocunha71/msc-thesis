To solve this problem, we need to consider two cases:

1. If the index i is even, we need to calculate the factorial of i. The factorial of i is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to i. In Python, we can use the built-in function `math.factorial()` to calculate the factorial of a number.

2. If the index i is odd, we need to calculate the sum of all positive integers less than or equal to i. In Python, we can use the built-in function `sum()` to calculate the sum of a range of numbers.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the code works:

1. Define the function `f(n)` that takes a parameter `n` as the size of the list.

2. Create an empty list called `result` to store the calculated values.

3. Use a loop to iterate from 1 to `n`. Inside the loop:

   a. Check if the current index `i` is even using the modulo operator `%`. If `i % 2 == 0`, it means `i` is even.
   
   b. If `i` is even, use `math.factorial(i)` to calculate the factorial of `i` and append it to the `result` list. Otherwise, use `sum(range(1, i + 1))` to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to `i` and append it to the `result` list.
   
4. After the loop finishes, return the `result` list.

Here's the Python code for the solution:

```python
import math

def f(n):
    result = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            result.append(math.factorial(i))
        else:
            result.append(sum(range(1, i + 1)))
    return result
```

You can test the function with the provided example `f(5)` to verify the correctness of the code:

```python
print(f(5))  # Output: [1, 2, 6, 24,
