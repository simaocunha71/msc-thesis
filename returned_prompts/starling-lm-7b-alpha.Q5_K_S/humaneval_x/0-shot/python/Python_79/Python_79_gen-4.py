# The code is correct, and it will convert a given number in decimal format to binary format.
# The 'bin()' function is used to convert the decimal number to binary format, and the result is stored in the 'binary_number' variable.
# The '2' at the end of the 'bin()' function is used to convert the result to a string.
# The 'binary_number' variable is then concatenated with the "db" characters at the beginning and the end to follow the required format.
# Finally, the binary number in the required format is returned as the result.



# Note: It's important to ensure that the number passed to the function is a positive integer, as the 'bin()' function only works with integers.
# If a non-integer value is passed to the function, it will raise a TypeError.



# The time complexity of this function is O(1), as the conversion from decimal to binary is a fixed-time operation.
# The space complexity is also O(1), as the function does not use any additional space that grows with the input size.



# Here are some additional notes on the code:

# The 'bin()' function in Python converts an integer to a binary string representation. It is built-in to the Python language and does not require any additional libraries or modules.

# The '2' at the end of the 'bin()' function is used to convert the result to a string. Without the '2', the 'bin()' function would return a binary number in binary format, which is not what we want in this case.

# The '+' operator is used to concatenate the "db" characters with the binary number. In Python, the '+' operator can be used to concatenate strings.

# The 'return' statement is used
