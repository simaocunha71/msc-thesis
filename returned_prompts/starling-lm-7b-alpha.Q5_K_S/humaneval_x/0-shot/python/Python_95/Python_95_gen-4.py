To solve this problem, we need to check if all the keys in the dictionary are either all in lowercase or all in uppercase. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this:

1. Initialize a boolean variable called all_lowercase to True and another one called all_uppercase to True.

2. Iterate over each key in the dictionary. For each key, check if it's uppercase or lowercase. If it's uppercase, set all_lowercase to False. If it's lowercase, set all_uppercase to False.

3. If both all_lowercase and all_uppercase are False, return False because this means that there are keys that are neither all uppercase nor all lowercase.

4. If all_lowercase is False, it means that there are keys that are not lowercase. In this case, return False.

5. If all_uppercase is False, it means that there are keys that are not uppercase. In this case, return False.

6. If both all_lowercase and all_uppercase are True, return True because this means that all keys are either all uppercase or all lowercase.

Here's the Python code that implements these steps:

```python
def check_dict_case(dict):
    all_lowercase = True
    all_uppercase = True
    for key in dict:
        if key.isupper():
            all_lowercase = False
        elif key.islower():
            all_uppercase = False
    if all_lowercase and all_uppercase:
        return True
    elif all_lowercase:
        return False
    elif all_uppercase:
        return False
```

This code will correctly return True for the first example, False for the second and third example, and True for the fourth and fifth example.

Note: The Python `isupper()` and `islower()` methods are used to check if a string is entirely in uppercase or lowercase, respectively.

In Python, all built-in types, including dictionaries, are case-sensitive. This means that `"A"` and `"a"` are considered to be different keys.

The `isupper()` method returns `True` if
