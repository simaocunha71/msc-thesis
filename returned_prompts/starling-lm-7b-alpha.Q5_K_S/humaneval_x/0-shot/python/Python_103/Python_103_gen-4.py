To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the average of the integers from n through m (inclusive). This can be done by adding the two numbers and dividing the sum by 2.
2. Round the result to the nearest integer. If the decimal part is greater than or equal to 0.5, round up; otherwise, round down.
3. Convert the rounded average to binary representation using the `bin()` function in Python.
4. If n is greater than m, return -1, indicating an invalid input.

Here's an example implementation of the solution in Python:

```python
def rounded_avg(n, m):
    if n > m:
        return -1
    avg = (n + m) / 2
    rounded_avg = round(avg)
    return f"0b{bin(rounded_avg)[2:]}"
```

You can use this function to test the examples provided in the question:

```python
print(rounded_avg(1, 5))  # Output: "0b11"
print(rounded_avg(7, 5))  # Output: -1
print(rounded_avg(10, 20))  # Output: "0b1111"
print(rounded_avg(20, 33))  # Output: "0b11010"
```

This implementation follows the steps outlined above and returns the binary representation of the rounded average as a string prefixed with "0b".

Note that the `bin()` function in Python returns a binary string with a prefix of "0b", so we need to slice the string starting from the third character (index 2) to remove the prefix.

The `round()` function is used to round the average to the nearest integer, rounding up if the decimal part is greater than or equal to 0.5, and rounding down otherwise.

If the input is invalid (i.e., n is greater than m), the function returns -1 as specified in the problem.

Overall, this solution provides the desired functionality of calculating the rounded average of the integers from n through m and converting it to binary representation.
