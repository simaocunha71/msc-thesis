# Test Cases
print(rounded_avg(1, 5))  # Output: "0b11"
print(rounded_avg(7, 5))  # Output: -1
print(rounded_avg(10, 20))  # Output: "0b1111"
print(rounded_avg(20, 33))  # Output: "0b11010"


# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Space Complexity: O(1)

# Here, we use a for loop to iterate through the range of numbers from n to m. We calculate the sum of all numbers in this range and store it in the total variable. Then, we calculate the average by dividing the total by the number of elements in the range. After rounding the average to the nearest integer, we convert it to binary using the bin() function and return the result. If n is greater than m, we return -1 to indicate an invalid input.
