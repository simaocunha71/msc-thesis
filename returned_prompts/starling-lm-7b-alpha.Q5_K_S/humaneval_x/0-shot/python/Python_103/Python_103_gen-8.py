To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the average of the integers from n through m (including n and m).
2. Round the average to the nearest integer.
3. Convert the rounded average to binary.
4. If n is greater than m, return -1.

Here's a detailed step-by-step solution:

1. Calculate the average of the integers from n through m (including n and m).
   This can be done by summing all the integers from n to m and dividing the sum by the number of integers.

2. Round the average to the nearest integer.
   To round to the nearest integer, you can use the round() function in Python. For example, round(3.6) will return 4, while round(3.4) will return 3.

3. Convert the rounded average to binary.
   In Python, you can use the bin() function to convert a number to binary. The bin() function returns a string representation of the binary number, prefixed with "0b". For example, bin(4) will return "0b100".

4. If n is greater than m, return -1.
   This can be done by checking if n is greater than m using an if statement. If the condition is true, you can return -1.

Here's a Python implementation of the solution:

```python
def rounded_avg(n, m):
    if n > m:
        return -1
    average = round(sum(i for i in range(n, m+1)) / (m - n + 1))
    binary_average = bin(average)[2:]
    return "0b" + binary_average
```

You can test the function with the provided examples:

```python
print(rounded_avg(1, 5))  # Output: "0b11"
print(rounded_avg(7, 5))  # Output: -1
print(rounded_avg(10, 20))  # Output: "0b1111"
print(rounded_avg(20, 33))  # Output: "0b110
