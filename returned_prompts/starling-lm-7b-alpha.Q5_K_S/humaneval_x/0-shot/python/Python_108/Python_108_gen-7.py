# Unit tests

# Explanation:
# The function count_nums takes in an array of integers and initializes a counter variable, count, to 0. It then iterates through each number in the array using a for loop. For each number, it uses the map function to convert the absolute value of the number to a list of its individual digits as integers. The sum function is then used to calculate the sum of these digits. If the sum is greater than 0, the count variable is incremented by 1. Finally, the function returns the count variable, which represents the number of elements in the array that have a sum of digits greater than 0.
