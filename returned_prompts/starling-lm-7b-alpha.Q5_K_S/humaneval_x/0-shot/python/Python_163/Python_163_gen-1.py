# Here's a breakdown of the solution:

# The `generate_integers` function is a generator function that takes in two
# positive integers `a` and `b`. It first checks if `a` is greater than `b`,
# and if so, it swaps the values of `a` and `b` to ensure that `a` is the
# smaller number and `b` is the larger number.

# Next, it checks if `a` is an even number (i.e., if `a` is divisible by 2). If
# so, it yields `a` as the first even number between `a` and `b`.

# Then, it enters a loop that continues as long as the sum of `a` and 2 is
# less than or equal to `b`. In each iteration of the loop, it yields the
# next even number by adding 2 to `a`. This ensures that only even numbers are
# generated between `a` and `b`.

# Finally, it checks if `b` is an even number and if `b` is not equal to `a`. If
# so, it yields `b` as the last even number between `a` and `b`.

# The `answers` list is used to collect all the even numbers generated by the
# `generate_integers` function, and the result is printed to the console.

# This solution uses a generator function to efficiently generate the even
# numbers between `a` and `b` in ascending order, without the need to store all
# the numbers in memory at once.

# It's important to note that generator functions are
