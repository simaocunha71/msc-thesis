To solve this problem, we can use the built-in max() function in Python, which returns the maximum element in the given list. Here's the code for the max_element function:

```python
def max_element(l: list):
    return max(l)
```

To verify the correctness of the function, we can use Python's doctest module to write test cases. Here are a couple of test cases for the max_element function:

```python
def test_max_element():
    assert max_element([1, 2, 3]) == 3
    assert max_element([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]) == 123

test_max_element()
```

When you run the test_max_element() function, it will execute the max_element function with the given test cases and check if the returned value is correct. If the returned value matches the expected value, the test case will pass; otherwise, it will fail.

In this case, since the max_element function correctly returns the maximum element in the list, both test cases will pass.

By following this approach, you can easily write and test functions in Python using doctest.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.
