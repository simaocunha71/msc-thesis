To encode a string by cycling groups of three characters, you can use the `encode_cyclic` function. This function splits the input string `s` into groups of three characters each. It then cycles the elements within each group, unless the group has fewer than three elements. Finally, it joins the cycled groups together to form the encoded string.

To decode a string that has been encoded with the `encode_cyclic` function, you can use the `decode_cyclic` function. This function takes the encoded string as input and returns the decoded string. It achieves this by splitting the input string into groups of three characters, cycling the elements within each group, and joining the cycled groups back together to form the decoded string.

Here's an example usage of the `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic` functions:

```python
input_string = "abcdefgh"
encoded_string = encode_cyclic(input_string)
print(encoded_string)  # Output: "bcdeghaf"
decoded_string = decode_cyclic(encoded_string)
print(decoded_string)  # Output: "abcdefgh"
```

In the example above, the `encode_cyclic` function is used to encode the string "abcdefgh" by cycling groups of three characters, resulting in the string "bcdeghaf". The `decode_cyclic` function is then used to decode the encoded string back to the original string, resulting in "abcdefgh".

You can use these functions to encode and decode strings using cyclic grouping of three characters.

Note: The `encode_cyclic` function assumes that the input string length is divisible by 3 or has a remainder of 1. If the input string length is not divisible by 3, the last group may have less than three elements.

The `decode_cyclic` function also assumes that the input string has been encoded using the `encode_cyclic` function. If the input string has been encoded with a different method, it may not be possible to correctly decode it using the `decode_cyclic` function.

In the `encode_cyclic` function, the `(len(s) + 2) // 3` expression is used to calculate the number of groups.
