In the `encode_cyclic` function, I split the string into groups of three characters. Then, I cycle the elements in each group, unless the group has fewer elements than three.

In the `decode_cyclic` function, I reverse the process. I join the cycled groups of three characters, taking into account the cycling that occurred during encoding.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the decoding process:

1. Split the input string into groups of three characters using list comprehension and slicing: `groups = [s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))] for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)]`. This creates a list of substrings, where each substring contains three consecutive characters from the original string.

2. Cycle the elements in each group, unless the group has fewer elements than three. This is done using list comprehension and string concatenation: `groups = [(group[1:] + group[0]) if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]`. If a group has exactly three elements, the second element is moved to the front, effectively cycling the elements. If a group has fewer than three elements, it remains unchanged.

3. Join the cycled groups of three characters back into a single string using the `join` method: `"".join(groups)`. This concatenates all the substrings in the `groups` list into a single string, resulting in the decoded message.

By following these steps, the `decode_cyclic` function successfully reverses the encoding process performed by the `encode_cyclic` function.

Here are some examples of usage:
```python
print(encode_cyclic("hello"))  # Output: helolle
print(decode_cyclic("helolle"))  # Output: hello
```

In the first example, the input string "hello" is encoded using the `encode_cyclic` function, resulting in the output string "helolle". In the second example, the encoded string "helolle" is decoded using the `decode_cyclic` function, producing the original string "hello".

Overall, the `encode_cyclic` and `decode_cyclic` functions provide
