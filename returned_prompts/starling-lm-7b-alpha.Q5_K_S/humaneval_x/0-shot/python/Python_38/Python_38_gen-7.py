In the `encode_cyclic` function, the string is split into groups of three characters using list comprehension. Each group is assigned to a variable in the list `groups`.
The `encode_cyclic` function cycles the elements in each group, unless the group has fewer elements than 3. This is achieved using a list comprehension as well. The cycled elements are joined back into a string using the `join` method, and the resulting string is returned.
The `decode_cyclic` function takes a string that has been encoded using the `encode_cyclic` function. It reverses the cycling process to obtain the original string. This is done by splitting the input string into groups of three characters, and then joining the characters in each group in reverse order. The resulting string is returned.

Here's an example of how to use the functions:

```python
# Encoding a string
encoded_string = encode_cyclic("abcdefg")
print(encoded_string)  # Output: cdefabeg

# Decoding a string
decoded_string = decode_cyclic("cdefabeg")
print(decoded_string)  # Output: abcdefg
```

In the example above, the `encode_cyclic` function is used to encode the string "abcdefg", resulting in the string "cdefabeg". The `decode_cyclic` function is then used to decode the string "cdefabeg", resulting in the original string "abcdefg".

The time complexity of both functions is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because each function iterates over the input string once. The space complexity is also O(n), as both functions create a new list to store the cycled characters.
