In the `encode_cyclic` function, the string is first split into groups of three characters. This is done using a list comprehension and the `s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))]` syntax. This syntax is used to get a slice of the string starting at `(3 * i)` and ending at `min((3 * i + 3), len(s))`. The `min` function is used here to ensure that the slice does not go beyond the length of the string.

The `groups` list comprehension then iterates over a range that is `(len(s) + 2) // 3` in length. This range is used to ensure that each group in the `groups` list contains three characters, even if the length of the input string is not a multiple of three.

In the `decode_cyclic` function, the input string is cycled by taking the second and third characters of each group and placing them before the first character. This is done using a list comprehension and the `(group[1:] + group[0]) if len(group) == 3 else group` syntax. This syntax checks if the length of the group is equal to three. If it is, it takes the second and third characters and places them before the first character. Otherwise, it leaves the group unchanged.

Finally, the cycled groups are joined back together into a string using the `"".join(groups)` syntax.
