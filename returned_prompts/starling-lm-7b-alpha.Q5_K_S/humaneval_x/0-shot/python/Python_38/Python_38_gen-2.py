In the encode_cyclic function, we split the string into groups of three characters. We then cycle the elements in each group, unless the group has fewer elements than three. This is done by taking the second and third element and placing them in front of the first element in the group. This creates a cyclic pattern in the string.

In the decode_cyclic function, we take the input string that was encoded with the encode_cyclic function and reverse the cyclic pattern to get the original string. This is done by taking the first element of each group and placing it at the end of the group, followed by the second and third elements. This creates a non-cyclic pattern in the string, which is the original string.

Here is an example of how the functions work:

encode_cyclic("abcdefg") -> "bcdeafg"
decode_cyclic("bcdeafg") -> "abcdefg"

The encode_cyclic function takes a string as input and returns the encoded string by cycling groups of three characters. The decode_cyclic function takes the encoded string as input and returns the decoded string.

The encode_cyclic function works by splitting the input string into groups of three characters. For each group, it cycles the elements by taking the second and third element and placing them in front of the first element in the group. This creates a cyclic pattern in the string. The function then joins all the groups back together into a single string.

The decode_cyclic function works by splitting the input string into groups of three characters. For each group, it takes the first element and places it at the end of the group, followed by the second and third elements. This creates a non-cyclic pattern in the string, which is the original string. The function then joins all the groups back together into a single string.

Here is an example of how the functions work:

encode_cyclic("abcdefg") -> "bcdeafg"
decode_cyclic("bcdeafg") -> "abcdefg"

The encode_cyclic function can be used to encode a string by cycling groups of three characters, and the decode_cyclic function can be used to decode the encoded string back to its original form.

Here is an example of how the functions can be used:

s = "abcdefg"
