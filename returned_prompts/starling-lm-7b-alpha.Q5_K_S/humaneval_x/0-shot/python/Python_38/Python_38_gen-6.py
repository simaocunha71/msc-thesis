The encode_cyclic function works by splitting the string into groups of three characters, and then cycling the elements within each group to create a new string. The decode_cyclic function works by reversing the process, splitting the string into groups and then reversing the cycling of the elements within each group to return the original string.

Here's how each function works:

The encode_cyclic function:
- Splits the input string into groups of three characters using a list comprehension and the range function. The index i is used to determine the starting and ending indices of each group in the input string.
- Creates a new list comprehension to cycle the elements within each group. If a group has fewer elements than three, it is left unchanged. Otherwise, the second element is moved to the front and the first element is moved to the end. The cycled groups are stored in the groups list.
- Joins the cycled groups back together into a single string using the join method, and returns the result.

The decode_cyclic function:
- Splits the input string into groups of three characters using a list comprehension and the range function. The index i is used to determine the starting and ending indices of each group in the input string.
- Creates a new list comprehension to reverse the cycling of the elements within each group. If a group has fewer elements than three, it is left unchanged. Otherwise, the first element is moved to the front and the second element is moved to the end. The reversed groups are stored in the groups list.
- Joins the reversed groups back together into a single string using the join method, and returns the result.

Here are some example usages of the encode_cyclic and decode_cyclic functions:

print(encode_cyclic("abcdef"))  # Output: "cedfba"
print(decode_cyclic("cedfba"))  # Output: "abcdef"

These functions can be used to encode and decode strings using a cyclic rotation of groups of three characters.
