In the provided code:

The encode_cyclic function takes a string as an input and returns an encoded string by cycling groups of three characters. Here's how it works:

The string is split into groups, each of length 3. For example, if the input string is "abcdefgh", the groups would be ["abc", "def", "gh"].
For each group, the elements are cycled so that the second element becomes the first, and the first element becomes the third. If the group has fewer elements than 3, it is not cycled. For example, if the group is "abc", it remains the same.
The cycled groups are then joined back together to form the encoded string.
The decode_cyclic function takes an encoded string as input and returns the original string. Here's how it works:

The encoded string is split into groups, each of length 3. For example, if the encoded string is "abcabcdefgh", the groups would be ["abc", "abc", "def", "gh"].
For each group, the elements are rearranged so that the first element becomes the second, and the second element becomes the first. The third element remains the same. If the group has fewer elements than 3, it is not rearranged. For example, if the group is "abc", it remains the same.
The rearranged groups are then joined back together to form the decoded string.
