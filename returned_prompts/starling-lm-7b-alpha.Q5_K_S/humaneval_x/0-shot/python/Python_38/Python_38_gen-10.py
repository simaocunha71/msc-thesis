In the "encode_cyclic" function, we start by splitting the string into groups of three characters. We use list comprehension to iterate over the string, starting at index 0 and incrementing by 3 at each iteration. For each index, we use slicing to select a substring of length 3, starting at the current index and ending at the smallest index that is a multiple of 3 and is less than or equal to the length of the string. We store these substrings in a list called "groups".

Next, we use another list comprehension to cycle the elements in each group. We only cycle the elements if the length of the group is exactly 3. If the length is less than 3, we leave the group unchanged. For each group, we take the second element and all subsequent elements, then concatenate them with the first element. This effectively cycles the elements. We store the cycled groups in a new list called "groups".

Finally, we join all the cycled groups back together into a single string using the "join" method, with an empty string as the separator. This gives us the encoded string.

In the "decode_cyclic" function, we start by splitting the input string into groups of three characters using slicing and concatenation. We use a for loop to iterate over the string, starting at index 0 and incrementing by 3 at each iteration. For each index, we use slicing to select a substring of length 3, starting at the current index and ending at the smallest index that is a multiple of 3 and is less than or equal to the length of the string. We store these substrings in a list called "groups".

Next, we use another for loop to reverse the cycling of elements in each group. For each group, we take the first element and all subsequent elements, then concatenate them with the second element. This effectively reverses the cycling. We store the decycled groups in a new list called "groups".

Finally, we join all the decycled groups back together into a single string using the "join" method, with an empty string as the separator. This gives us the decoded string.
