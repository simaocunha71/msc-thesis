In the encode_cyclic function, the string is divided into groups of three characters. Each of these groups is then cycled, with the last character in the group becoming the first, and the first character in the group becoming the last. The cycled groups are then joined together to form the encoded string.

In the decode_cyclic function, the input string is split into the same groups of three characters. Each of these groups is cycled in reverse, with the first character in the group becoming the last, and the last character in the group becoming the first. The cycled groups are then joined together to form the decoded string, which is the same as the original string.

The purpose of these functions is to encode and decode a string using a cyclic shift of characters within groups of three. This can be useful in various applications, such as data compression or encryption.

Here is an example usage of the functions:

```python
encoded_string = encode_cyclic("abcdefg")
print(encoded_string)  # Output: "bcdcfeag"

decoded_string = decode_cyclic(encoded_string)
print(decoded_string)  # Output: "abcdefg"
```
In this example, the original string "abcdefg" is encoded using the encode_cyclic function, resulting in the string "bcdcfeag". The encoded string is then decoded using the decode_cyclic function, resulting in the original string "abcdefg".

Overall, these functions provide a way to encode and decode strings using a cyclic shift of characters within groups of three, which can be useful in various applications.
