# Here is a step-by-step explanation of the solution:
# 1. Firstly, we create a list of tuples, where each tuple consists of a number from the input list and its index in the original list.
# 2. Then, we sort the list of tuples by the sum of the digits of the numbers. In the case of the same sum of the digits, we prioritize the original index in the input list.
# 3. Finally, we return a new list of numbers without the indices, which is obtained by extracting the first element of each tuple from the sorted list of tuples.
