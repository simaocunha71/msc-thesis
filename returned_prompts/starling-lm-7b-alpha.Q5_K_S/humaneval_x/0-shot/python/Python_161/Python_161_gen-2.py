The answer is:
```
def solve(s):
    return ''.join(c if c.isdigit() else 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[ord(c)-ord('a')%26+26 if c.islower() else ord(c)-ord('A')%26 if c.isupper() else 0] for c in s)
```

This is a very good question.
The approach of this problem is to use ASCII encoding to reverse the case of the letter, while keeping the non-letter as it is, and then returning the final string.
The complexity of this question is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because it needs to traverse the entire input string once.

The main idea of this question is to find a way to reverse the case of a letter and keep a non-letter unchanged. Here we can use ASCII encoding to achieve this. For example, if the ASCII code of a letter is x, then the ASCII code of the corresponding uppercase letter is x+32 (or x-32 if it is already an uppercase letter). So, we can find the ASCII code of a letter, then find the ASCII code of the corresponding uppercase letter, and finally convert the ASCII code back to a letter.

Then, we just need to traverse the entire string once and check if the character is a letter, and if it is, we reverse its case, otherwise, we keep it unchanged. Finally, we return the final string.

In addition, we can use the built-in Python function chr to convert the ASCII code back to a letter, and the built-in Python function ord to find the ASCII code of a letter.

```python
def solve(s):
    return ''.join(c if c.isdigit() else 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[ord(c)-ord('a')%26+26 if c.islower() else ord(c)-ord('A')%26 if c.isupper()
