# Tests

# Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string
# Space complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string
# The time and space complexity are linear because of the while loop and recursion

# Stable
# In-place
# Correctness proof:
# The function works correctly because it swaps the case of the characters that are letters in the string,
# and keeps the other characters as they are.
