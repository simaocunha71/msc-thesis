The answer is:
```
def solve(s):
    if not any(char.isalpha() for char in s):
        return s[::-1]
    else:
        return ''.join(c.upper() if c.islower() else c.lower() for c in s)
```

Explanation:
This solution first checks if the string contains any letters. If it does not, it simply returns the reversed string. Otherwise, it uses a generator expression to iterate over the string and convert each lowercase letter to uppercase, and each uppercase letter to lowercase. The resulting string is returned.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

- `any(char.isalpha() for char in s)` checks if any character in the string `s` is a letter. It returns `True` if there are any letters, and `False` otherwise.
- `s[::-1]` is a slicing operation that returns a reversed version of the string `s`.
- `c.upper() if c.islower() else c.lower()` is a conditional expression that checks if a character `c` is lowercase. If it is, it converts the character to uppercase; otherwise, it converts the character to lowercase.
- `''.join(...)` joins all the characters in the generator expression into a single string.

With these steps, the function correctly solves the problem as described in the question.

```python
print(solve("1234"))  # Output: "4321"
print(solve("ab"))    # Output: "AB"
print(solve("#a@C"))  # Output: "#A@c"
```

These test cases verify that the function works correctly for different inputs, including strings with and without letters, and strings with special characters.

```python
assert solve("1234") == "4321"
assert solve("ab") == "AB"
assert solve("#a@C") == "#A@c"
```

These assertions ensure that the function produces the expected output for the provided test cases, further demonstrating its correctness.
