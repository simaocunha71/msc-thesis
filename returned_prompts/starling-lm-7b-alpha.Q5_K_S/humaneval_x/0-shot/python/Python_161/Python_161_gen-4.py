The function `solve(s)` will take a string `s` as an input. The function will iterate through the string and check if the character at index `i` is a letter or not. If the character is a letter, the function will reverse its case, i.e., if the letter is lowercase, it will be converted to uppercase, and vice versa. If the character is not a letter, the function will keep it as it is. After iterating through the entire string, the function will return the resulted string.

Here are some examples to illustrate the function:

1. `solve("1234")`: In this example, the string `s` contains only digits, so there are no letters to reverse their case. The function will return the string as it is, i.e., "1234".

2. `solve("ab")`: In this example, the string `s` contains two lowercase letters 'a' and 'b'. The function will reverse the case of these letters and return the string "AB".

3. `solve("#a@C")`: In this example, the string `s` contains one lowercase letter 'a', one uppercase letter 'C', and two non-letter characters '#' and '@'. The function will reverse the case of the lowercase letter 'a' and return the string "#A@c".

Here's a Python implementation of the function:

```python
def solve(s):
    result = ""
    for char in s:
        if char.isalpha():
            result += chr(ord(char.lower()) ^ 32)
        else:
            result += char
    return result[::-1]
```

This implementation uses a for loop to iterate through each character in the input string `s`. The `isalpha()` method is used to check if the character is a letter. If it is, the `ord()` function is used to get the ASCII value of the character, and the `^` operator is used to invert the case of the letter. The `chr()` function is then used to convert the inverted ASCII value back to a character. If the character is not a letter, it is appended to the `result` string as it is.
