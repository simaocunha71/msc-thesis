Explanation:
The function takes a string as input and checks if the string is all numeric. If the string is all numeric, the function reverses the string and returns the result. If the string contains any letters, the function iterates over each character in the string and checks if the character is lowercase. If the character is lowercase, the function converts it to uppercase by subtracting the ASCII value of 'a' from the ASCII value of the character and adding the ASCII value of 'A'. If the character is uppercase, the function converts it to lowercase by subtracting the ASCII value of 'A' from the ASCII value of the character and adding the ASCII value of 'a'. The function then joins all the characters back into a string and reverses the string. The reversed string is returned as the result.
