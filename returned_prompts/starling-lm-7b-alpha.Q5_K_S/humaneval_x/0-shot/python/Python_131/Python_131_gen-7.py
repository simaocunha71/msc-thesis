To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the integer to a string, so that we can access each digit one by one.
2. Initialize a variable `product` to 1, which will store the product of odd digits.
3. Iterate through each digit in the string representation of the integer.
4. Check if the current digit is odd (i.e., if its integer value modulo 2 is 1).
5. If the current digit is odd, multiply the `product` by the current digit and update the `product`.
6. After iterating through all the digits, return the `product`. If all digits are even, the `product` will remain 1.

Here is the Python code that implements the above steps:

```python
def digits(n):
    # Convert the integer to a string
    n_str = str(n)
    product = 1

    # Iterate through each digit in the string representation of the integer
    for digit in n_str:
        # Check if the current digit is odd
        if int(digit) % 2 == 1:
            # If the current digit is odd, multiply the product by the current digit and update the product
            product *= int(digit)

    # After iterating through all the digits, return the product
    return product
```

You can test the function using the provided examples:

```python
print(digits(1))  # Output: 1
print(digits(4))  # Output: 0
print(digits(235))  # Output: 15
```

The function `digits(n)` takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns the product of the odd digits in `n`. If all digits are even, the function returns 0.

For example, for the input `n = 1`, all digits are odd (1), so the product of odd digits is 1. For the input `n = 4`, all digits are even (4), so the product of odd digits is 0. For the input `n = 235`, the odd digits are 3 and 5, so the product of
