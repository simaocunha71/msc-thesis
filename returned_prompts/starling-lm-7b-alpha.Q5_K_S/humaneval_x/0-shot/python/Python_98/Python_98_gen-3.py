To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize a variable called `count` to keep track of the number of uppercase vowels in even indices. Set its initial value to 0.
2. Iterate over the string `s` using the `enumerate()` function. This function will provide both the index and value of each character in the string.
3. Inside the loop, check if the index is even (`i % 2 == 0`). If it is, check if the character is an uppercase vowel (`vowel in 'AEIOU'`). If both conditions are true, increment the `count` variable by 1.
4. After the loop, return the final value of the `count` variable.

Here's an example implementation of the solution:

```python
def count_upper(s):
    count = 0
    for i, vowel in enumerate(s):
        if i % 2 == 0 and vowel in 'AEIOU':
            count += 1
    return count
```

By following these steps, the function `count_upper` will return the number of uppercase vowels in even indices of the given string `s`.

You can test the function with the provided examples to verify its correctness:

```python
print(count_upper('aBCdEf'))  # Output: 1
print(count_upper('abcdefg'))  # Output: 0
print(count_upper('dBBE'))  # Output: 0
```

Each test case should produce the expected result, confirming the correctness of the `count_upper` function.

Note: The `enumerate()` function is used to iterate over the string `s` with both the index and value of each character. This allows us to check the index (`i`) to determine if it is even (`i % 2 == 0`). Additionally, we can use the `in` operator to check if a character is an uppercase vowel (`vowel in 'AEIOU'`).

By combining these checks and keeping track of the count using the `count` variable, we can accurately count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices of
