To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize a counter variable to 0. This variable will be used to store the count of uppercase vowels in even indices.
2. Iterate through the string using a for loop, starting from index 0 and ending at index (length of string - 1).
3. Inside the loop, check if the current character at index i is an uppercase vowel (A, E, I, O, or U). We can use the `isupper()`
