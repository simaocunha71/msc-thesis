The function `count_upper` takes a string `s` as an argument and counts the number of uppercase vowels in even indices of the string. The uppercase vowels are 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', and 'U'. The function initializes a variable `count` to 0, then iterates over the indices of the string using a for loop. For each even index `i`, it checks if the character at index `i` is an uppercase vowel by using the `isupper()` method. If the character is an uppercase vowel, it increments the `count` variable by 1. Finally, the function returns the value of the `count` variable.

Here is an example usage of the function:

```python
print(count_upper('aBCdEf'))  # Output: 1
print(count_upper('abcdefg'))  # Output: 0
print(count_upper('dBBE'))  # Output: 0
```

The first example returns 1 because there is one uppercase vowel 'B' at index 1, which is an even index. The second example returns 0 because there are no uppercase vowels at even indices. The third example also returns 0 for the same reason.

Overall, the function `count_upper` provides a way to count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices of a given string.

In Python, the `isupper()` method is a built-in method for strings that returns True if all characters in the string are uppercase, and False otherwise. It can be used to check if a character is an uppercase letter.

Here is the code for the `count_upper` function:

```python
def count_upper(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(0, len(s), 2):
        if s[i].isupper() and s[i] in ['A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U']:
            count += 1
    return count
```

This function uses a for loop that iterates over the indices of the string `s` using the `range()` function. The `range()` function takes three arguments: the starting index, the
