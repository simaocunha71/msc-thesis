The number of uppercase vowels in even indices of a string s can be calculated by iterating over the string, checking if the index is even and if the character is an uppercase vowel. If both conditions are met, the vowel is added to a count. The function `count_upper` takes a string `s` as input and returns the count of uppercase vowels in even indices.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Define a function `count_upper` that takes a string `s` as input.
2. Initialize a variable `count` to 0, which will store the count of uppercase vowels in even indices.
3. Iterate over the string `s` using a `for` loop. For each character in the string, the loop variable `c` takes the value of the character.
4. Check if the index of the current character is even using the condition `i % 2 == 0`. The `%` operator calculates the remainder of the division of `i` by 2. If the remainder is 0, then `i` is even.
5. If the index is even, check if the character `c` is an uppercase vowel. The uppercase vowels are defined as 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', and 'U'. You can use the `in` operator to check if `c` is in the string `'AEIOU'`.
6. If the character `c` is an uppercase vowel and the index is even, increment the `count` variable by 1.
7. After iterating over all the characters in the string, return the final value of `count`.
8. Call the `count_upper` function with different test cases to verify the correctness of the solution.

Here's an example of how you can use the `count_upper` function:

```python
def count_upper(s):
    count = 0
    for i, c in enumerate(s):
        if i % 2 == 0 and c in 'AEIOU':
            count += 1
    return count

# Test cases
print(count_upper('aBCdEf'))  # Expected output: 1
print(
