To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize a counter variable to keep track of the number of uppercase vowels in even indices. Set it to 0 initially.
2. Iterate through the string `s` using a for loop. Use the `enumerate()` function to access both the index and the character of the string.
3. Check if the index is even using the modulo operator (`%`). If the index is even, then check if the character is an uppercase vowel (i.e., 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'). You can use the `isupper()` method to check if a character is uppercase and the `in` operator to check if a character is one of the vowels.
4. If an uppercase vowel is found at an even index, increment the counter by 1.
5. After iterating through the entire string, return the final value of the counter.

Here's an example implementation of the `count_upper()` function:

```python
def count_upper(s):
    counter = 0
    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        if i % 2 == 0 and char.isupper() and char in 'AEIOU':
            counter += 1
    return counter
```

You can test the function with the provided examples:

```python
print(count_upper('aBCdEf'))  # Output: 1
print(count_upper('abcdefg'))  # Output: 0
print(count_upper('dBBE'))  # Output: 0
```

The function will correctly count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices of the given string.

In the example implementation, the `enumerate()` function is used to iterate through the string `s` while keeping track of both the index and the character. The condition `i % 2 == 0` checks if the index is even. The `char.isupper()` method checks if the character is uppercase, and the `char in 'AEIOU'` condition checks if the character is one of the uppercase vowels. If all these conditions are met, the counter is incremented by 1. Finally, the
