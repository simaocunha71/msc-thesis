To determine if all numbers in the list `l` are below the threshold `t`, you can iterate through each number in the list and check if it is less than the threshold. If any number is not below the threshold, the function should return `False`. Otherwise, it should return `True`.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. Define the function `below_threshold` with two parameters: `l` (the list of numbers) and `t` (the threshold).
2. Iterate through each number `n` in the list `l` using a `for` loop.
3. Check if `n` is not less than the threshold `t` using the `not` keyword and the `<` operator. If it is not less than the threshold, return `False` immediately.
4. If all numbers in the list are below the threshold, the function will reach the end of the loop without returning `False`, so it will return `True` by default.
5. Test the function with a few example cases to verify its correctness.

Here's the code for the solution:

```python
def below_threshold(l: list, t: int):
    for n in l:
        if not (n < t):
            return False
    return True
```

And here are a couple of test cases:

```python
print(below_threshold([1, 2, 4, 10], 100))  # Expected output: True
print(below_threshold([1, 20, 4, 10], 5))  # Expected output: False
```

These test cases confirm that the function correctly determines if all numbers in the list are below the threshold.

Note: In Python, the `<` operator checks if the left operand is less than the right operand. The `not` keyword negates a boolean value, so `not (n < t)` checks if `n` is not less than `t`.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.
