To determine if all numbers in the list l are below the threshold t, you can follow these steps:

1. Initialize a variable named result to True. This variable will keep track of whether all numbers in the list are below the threshold.
2. Iterate through each number in the list l using a for loop. For each number, compare it with the threshold t. If the number is greater than or equal to the threshold, set the result to False and break out of the loop. This indicates that at least one number in the list is not below the threshold.
3. If the loop completes without encountering a number greater than or equal to the threshold, the result will remain True. In this case, return True to indicate that all numbers in the list are below the threshold.
4. Otherwise, if the loop is broken early due to finding a number greater than or equal to the threshold, return False to indicate that not all numbers in the list are below the threshold.

Here's an example implementation of the solution in Python:

```python
def below_threshold(l: list, t: int):
    result = True
    for num in l:
        if num >= t:
            result = False
            break
    return result
```

You can test the function using the provided test cases:

```python
print(below_threshold([1, 2, 4, 10], 100))  # Expected output: True
print(below_threshold([1, 20, 4, 10], 5))  # Expected output: False
```

The function will return True if all numbers in the list are below the threshold, and False otherwise.
