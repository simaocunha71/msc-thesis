Here's a possible solution to the problem:

```python
def below_threshold(l: list, t: int):
    """Return True if all numbers in the list l are below threshold t.
    >>> below_threshold([1, 2, 4, 10], 100)
    True
    >>> below_threshold([1, 20, 4, 10], 5)
    False
    """

    for num in l:
        if num > t:
            return False
    return True
```

This solution works by iterating through each number in the list l. For each number, it checks if the number is greater than the threshold t. If it is, the function immediately returns False, indicating that not all numbers in the list are below the threshold. If no number is greater than the threshold, the function returns True, indicating that all numbers in the list are below the threshold.

Note that the function uses a for loop to iterate through the list. This is a common and idiomatic way to iterate through all elements of a list in Python. The loop variable num is used to represent each number in the list as we iterate through it.

The function uses the if statement to check if the current number is greater than the threshold. If it is, the function immediately returns False. If the loop completes without encountering any numbers greater than the threshold, the function returns True.

Overall, this solution provides a straightforward and efficient way to determine if all numbers in a list are below a given threshold.
