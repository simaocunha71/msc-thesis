To determine if all numbers in the list `l` are below the threshold `t`, you can use a for loop to iterate through each number in the list. Inside the loop, you can check if each number is less than the threshold. If any number is not less than the threshold, you can immediately return False. If the loop completes without returning False, it means that all numbers in the list are below the threshold, and you can return True.

Here's the code for the `below_threshold` function:

```python
def below_threshold(l: list, t: int) -> bool:
    for num in l:
        if num >= t:
            return False
    return True
```

In the provided examples, the first call `below_threshold([1, 2, 4, 10], 100)` returns True because all numbers in the list are below 100. The second call `below_threshold([1, 20, 4, 10], 5)` returns False because the number 20 is not below the threshold of 5.

You can use this function to determine if all numbers in a list are below a certain threshold.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 4, 10]
threshold = 100
result = below_threshold(numbers, threshold)
print(result)  # Output: True
```

```python
numbers = [1, 20, 4, 10]
threshold = 5
result = below_threshold(numbers, threshold)
print(result)  # Output: False
```

```python
numbers = [3, 5, 7, 9]
threshold = 10
result = below_threshold(numbers, threshold)
print(result)  # Output: True
```

```python
numbers = [100, 200, 300, 400]
threshold = 500
result = below_threshold(numbers, threshold)
print(result)  # Output: False
```

```python
numbers = []
threshold = 0
result = below_
