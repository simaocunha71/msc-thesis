Here is one possible implementation:

```python
def below_threshold(l: list, t: int):
    """Return True if all numbers in the list l are below threshold t.
    >>> below_threshold([1, 2, 4, 10], 100)
    True
    >>> below_threshold([1, 20, 4, 10], 5)
    False
    """
    for i in l:
        if i > t:
            return False
    return True
```

In this implementation, we iterate over the list `l` and check if any number is greater than `t`. If we find any number greater than `t`, we immediately return `False` to indicate that not all numbers in the list are below the threshold. If the loop finishes without finding any number greater than `t`, we return `True`.

The time complexity of this implementation is O(n), where n is the length of the input list `l`. This is because we only need to iterate over the list once to determine if all numbers are below the threshold.

The space complexity of this implementation is O(1), because we are not using any additional data structures that scale with the size of the input list.

This implementation correctly answers the question based on the given example tests.
