# Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:
# 
# 1. First, we check if the list is empty. If it is, we return None because there are no elements to find the second smallest from.
# 2. If the list has only one element, we also return None because there are no other elements to compare with.
# 3. If the list has exactly two elements, we simply return the only element, as there is no second smallest element.
# 4. If the list has more than
