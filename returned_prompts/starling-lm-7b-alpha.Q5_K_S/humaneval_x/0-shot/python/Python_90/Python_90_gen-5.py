    # Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:
    # Step 1: Sort the list in ascending order using the sorted() function.
    # Step 2: Check if the length of the sorted list is less than 2. If it is, return None, as there are no 2nd smallest elements.
    # Step 3: Return the second element of the sorted list.

    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    if len(sorted_lst) < 2:

# Test cases:
print(next_smallest([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Expected output: 2
print(next_smallest([5, 1, 4, 3, 2]))  # Expected output: 2
print(next_smallest([]))  # Expected output: None
print(next_smallest([1, 1]))  # Expected output: None
