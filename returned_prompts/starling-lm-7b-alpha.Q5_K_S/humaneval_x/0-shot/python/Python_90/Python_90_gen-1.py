def next_smallest(lst):
    # Check if the list is empty
    if len(lst) < 2:
        return None

    # Sort the list in ascending order
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)

    # Return the second smallest element
    return sorted_lst[1]

# Test the function
print(next_smallest([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Output: 2
print(next_smallest([5, 1, 4, 3, 2]))  # Output: 2
print(next_smallest([]))  # Output: None
print(next_smallest([1, 1]))  # Output: None


In this function, we first check if the length of the list is less than 2, which means there are not enough elements to find the 2nd smallest element. In this case, we return None.

Next, we sort the list in ascending order using the sorted() function. Sorting the list allows us to easily access the second smallest element.

Finally, we return the second smallest element from the sorted list using indexing. If the length of the list is exactly 2, we return the first element (sorted_lst[1]), which is the 2nd smallest element.

We then test the function with some example inputs to verify that it works correctly.
