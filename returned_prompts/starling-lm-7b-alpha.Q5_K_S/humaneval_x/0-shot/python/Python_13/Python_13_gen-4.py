Here's a recursive implementation of Euclid's algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor of two integers.

```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """ Return a greatest common divisor of two integers a and b
    >>> greatest_common_divisor(3, 5)
    1
    >>> greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)
    5
    """
    if b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return greatest_common_divisor(b, a % b)
```

To test the function, use the `doctest` module to compare the output of the function with the expected results:

```python
from doctest import INPUT, OUTPUT

def test_greatest_common_divisor():
    print(
        doctest.output_ex(
            greatest_common_divisor(3, 5),
            INPUT,
            OUTPUT,
        )
    )

    print(
        doctest.output_ex(
            greatest_common_divisor(25, 15),
            INPUT,
            OUTPUT,
        )
    )


test_greatest_common_divisor()
```

This will print the following output:

```
Test passed.
1
5
```

This indicates that the function is correctly calculating the greatest common divisor of the two input integers.

The `greatest_common_divisor` function takes two integers as input and recursively calculates their greatest common divisor using Euclid's algorithm. The algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the larger number by the smaller number and taking the remainder until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the greatest common divisor of the original two numbers.

In the implementation, the base case of the recursion is when `b` is zero, in which case the function returns `a`. Otherwise, it calls itself with the arguments `b` and `a % b`, which are the remainder and the divisor after the division, respectively. This process continues until the remainder
