Here's an example of how to use the `greatest_common_divisor` function:

```python
result = greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)
print(result)  # Output: 5
```

In this example, we call the `greatest_common_divisor` function with the arguments `25` and `15`. The function calculates the greatest common divisor of these two numbers and returns the result, which is assigned to the variable `result`. Finally, we print the value of `result`, which is `5`.
