# Here's a correct implementation:

def odd_count(lst):
    return ["the number of odd elements "+str(sum(1 for i in lst[i] if int(i)%2!=0))+"n the str"+str(i)+"ng "+str(i)+" of the "+str(i)+"nput." for i in range(len(lst))]
```
Here's an explanation of the code:

The function `odd_count` takes a list of strings `lst` as input. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over the indices of the strings in `lst`. For each index `i`, it creates a string that describes the number of odd digits in the `i`-th string of `lst`. The result is a list of these strings.

In the original implementation, the line `[i for i in lst[i] if int(i)%2!=0]` is incorrect because it tries to iterate over the characters of each string in `lst` using the index `i` from the outer loop. This will result in an error because `i` is not defined in the inner loop. 

To fix this, we can use the `sum` function with a generator expression to count the number of odd digits in each string. The generator expression `(1 for i in lst[i] if int(i)%2!=0)` creates an iterator that yields `1` for each odd digit in the string at index `i` of `lst`. The `sum` function then adds up all the `1`'s to get the total count of odd digits.

Finally, the resulting count is converted to a string and concatenated with the rest of the description string using string concatenation (`+`).
