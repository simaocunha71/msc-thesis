Here is the solution:

The code defines a function `poly` that evaluates a polynomial with coefficients `xs` at point `x`. The function `find_zero` finds the zero of the polynomial with coefficients `xs`. The `poly` function calculates the value of the polynomial at a given point `x` by summing the product of each coefficient and the corresponding power of `x`. The `find_zero` function uses Newton's method to find the zero of the polynomial. It starts with an initial approximation `x0` and iteratively updates it until the difference between consecutive approximations is small enough. The function returns the zero point rounded to two decimal places.

To use the function, you can simply call `find_zero` with a list of coefficients as the argument. For example, `find_zero([1, 2])` will return the zero point of the polynomial `1 + 2x`, which is `-0.5`. Similarly, `find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1])` will return the zero point of the polynomial `(x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3)`, which is `1.0`.

Overall, this code provides a convenient way to find the zero of a polynomial given its coefficients.

Here are some additional test cases to demonstrate the functionality of the code:
```python
print(round(find_zero([
