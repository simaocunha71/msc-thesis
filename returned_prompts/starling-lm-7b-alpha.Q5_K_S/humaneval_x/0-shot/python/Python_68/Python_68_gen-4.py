To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Initialize an empty list `even_values` to store the even values found in the array.
2. Iterate through the array `arr` and check if each number is even (number % 2 == 0). If it is, append it to the `even_values` list.
3. If `even_values` is not empty, initialize `min_value` and `min_index` to the first value and index in the `even_values` list.
4. Iterate through the `even_values` list and compare each value with the current `min_value`. If you find a smaller even value, update `min_value` and `min_index` with the new values. If you find an even value with the same value as `min_value`, update `min_index` with the index of the new value if it's smaller.
5. Return the `min_value` and `min_index` as a list.
6. If `even_values` is empty, return an empty list since there are no even values in the array.

Here's a Python solution using the steps described above:

```python
def pluck(arr):
    even_values = [value for value in arr if value % 2 == 0]

    if not even_values:
        return []

    min_value = even_values[0]
    min_index = 0

    for index, value in enumerate(even_values):
        if value < min_value:
            min_value = value
            min_index = index
        elif value == min_value:
            if index < min_index:
                min_index = index

    return [min_value, min_index]
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array, as it iterates through the array once to find the even values and then iterates through them again to find the smallest even value. The space complexity is O(1) since it only uses a constant amount of additional space to store the `min_value` and `min_index`.

```python
def pluck(arr):
    even_values = [value for
