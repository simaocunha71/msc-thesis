The pluck function in this problem aims to find the node with the smallest even value in an array and return it in a list format [smallest_value, its index]. If there are no even values or the given array is empty, the function should return an empty list [].

To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Initialize an empty list called "even_nodes" to store the even nodes and their indices.

2. Traverse the input array and check if each node's value is even (node % 2 == 0). If it is, append the node's value and its index to the "even_nodes" list.

3. Sort the "even_nodes" list based on the values (smallest to largest) using the sort() function.

4. If the "even_nodes" list is empty, return an empty list [].

5. If the "even_nodes" list contains at least one node, return the smallest value and its index as a list [even_nodes[0][0], even_nodes[0][1]].

Here's an example implementation of the pluck function in Python:

```python
def pluck(arr):
    even_nodes = []
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] % 2 == 0:
            even_nodes.append([arr[i], i])
    even_nodes.sort()
    if len(even_nodes) == 0:
        return []
    return [even_nodes[0][0], even_nodes[0][1]]
```

This implementation first initializes an empty list "even_nodes". It then traverses the input array using a for loop and checks if each node's value is even. If it is, the node's value and its index are appended to the "even_nodes" list. After that, the "even_nodes" list is sorted based on the values. Finally, the function checks if the "even_nodes" list is empty. If it is, an empty list is returned. Otherwise, the smallest value and its index are returned as a list.

You can use this implementation to solve the problem and get the desired output.
