To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest even value and its index in the given array. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. Initialize two variables, `min_value` and `min_index`, to track the smallest even value and its index respectively. Set `min_value` to infinity and `min_index` to -1.
2. Iterate through each element `node` in the input array `arr`.
3. Check if the `node` is even by using the modulo operator `%` and verifying if the remainder is zero. If it is, proceed to the next step.
4. Compare the `node` value with the current `min_value`. If the `node` value is smaller than `min_value`, update `min_value` to the `node` value and `min_index` to the index of the `node` in the array.
5. After iterating through all elements, check if the `min_value` is still infinity. If it is, it means there are no even values or the array is empty. In this case, return an empty list `[]`.
6. Otherwise, return a list containing the `min_value` and `min_index` as the smallest even value and its index, respectively.

Here's the Python code that implements the above solution:

```python
def pluck(arr):
    min_value = float('inf')
    min_index = -1
    for node in arr:
        if node % 2 == 0:
            if node < min_value:
                min_value = node
                min_index = arr.index(node)
    if min_value == float('inf'):
        return []
    else:
        return [min_value, min_index]
```

You can use this function by passing the array `[4,2,3]`, `[1,2,3]`, `[]`, or `[5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]` as an argument to test the solution. The function will return the expected output for each example.

```python
print(pluck([4,2,3]))  # Output: [2, 1]
