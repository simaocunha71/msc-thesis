To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize a variable `even_values` to store the even values in the array and their indices. We can do this by iterating through the array and checking if each value is even. If it is, we append a tuple of `(value, index)` to the `even_values` list.

2. If there are no even values in the array, return an empty list `[]`.

3. If there is at least one even value, we need to find the smallest value and its index. We can do this by using the `min()` function on the `even_values` list, which returns a tuple of `(min_value, min_index)`.

4. Return the `min_value` and `min_index` as the result.

Here's the Python code that implements these steps:

```python
def pluck(arr):
    even_values = []
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] % 2 == 0:
            even_values.append((arr[i], i))
    if not even_values:
        return []
    min_value, min_index = min(even_values)
    return [min_value, min_index]
```

You can test the function with the provided examples to verify that it returns the correct output.

For example, when you call `pluck([4, 2, 3])`, it should return `[2, 1]` because 2 is the smallest even value and it has the smallest index.

Similarly, when you call `pluck([1, 2, 3])`, it should return `[2, 1]` because 2 is the smallest even value and it has the smallest index.

When you call `pluck([])`, it should return an empty list `[]` because there are no even values in the given array.

And finally, when you call `pluck([5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2])`, it should return `[0, 1]` because 0 is the smallest even value, but there are two zeros, so we choose the first zero, which has the smallest index.
