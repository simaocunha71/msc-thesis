To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the array and find the smallest even value. Here is a step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize two variables, `even_value` and `even_index`, to store the smallest even value and its index, respectively. Set them to positive infinity and 0, respectively.
2. Iterate through the array using a for loop and the `enumerate` function to get both the index and value of each node.
3. Check if the value is even (`value % 2 == 0`). If it is, compare it with the current smallest even value (`even_value`). If the value is smaller, update `even_value` and `even_index` with the new smallest even value and its index.
4. After iterating through all the nodes, return the smallest even value and its index as a list `[even_value, even_index]`. If no even values are found, return an empty list `[]`.

Here's the code that implements this solution:

```python
def pluck(arr):
    even_value = float('inf')
    even_index = 0

    for index, value in enumerate(arr):
        if value % 2 == 0 and value < even_value:
            even_value = value
            even_index = index

    return [even_value, even_index] if even_value != float('inf') else []
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array, as we only iterate through the array once.

For example, if we call the `pluck` function with the input `[4, 2, 3]`, it will return `[2, 1]` because 2 is the smallest even value and it has the smallest index.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
