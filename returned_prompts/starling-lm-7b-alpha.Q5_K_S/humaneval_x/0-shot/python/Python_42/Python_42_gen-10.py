The above code is a Python function named `incr_list` that takes a single argument `l`, which is expected to be a list. The function returns a new list where each element of the original list `l` is incremented by 1. 

Here's a breakdown of the code:

- The function takes a parameter `l` which represents the input list.
- Inside the function, a new list called `incr_list` is created using list comprehension. List comprehension is a compact way of creating a new list by applying an expression to each element of an existing list.
- The expression `i + 1` increments each element `i` in the original list `l` by 1. The result is a new list with the incremented values.
- The function then returns the newly created list.

To test the function, there are a couple of `>>>` comments followed by function calls and expected outputs. These comments are used to demonstrate the usage of the function and verify its correctness.

For example, when `incr_list([1, 2, 3])` is called, it returns `[2, 3, 4]` because each element in the original list is incremented by 1. Similarly, when `incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])` is called, it returns `[6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]` for the same reason.

In summary, the `incr_list` function takes a list as an input and returns a new list with each element incremented by 1.
