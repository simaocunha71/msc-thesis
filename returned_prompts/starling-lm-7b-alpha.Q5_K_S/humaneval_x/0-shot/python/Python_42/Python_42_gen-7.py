The function incr_list takes in a list and returns a new list with each element incremented by 1. Here is a step-by-step explanation of how the function works:

1. The function definition starts with the line `def incr_list(l: list):` which indicates that the function is named `incr_list` and it takes in one argument, `l`, which must be a list.

2. The function body consists of a single line: `return [i + 1 for i in l]`. This line uses a list comprehension to create a new list. For each element `i` in the input list `l`, the element is incremented by 1 and added to the new list.

3. The function ends with a colon `:` followed by an indentation block, which indicates that the rest of the code inside the block is part of the function.

4. The function is documented using a docstring, which is a string that appears right after the function definition. The docstring provides a brief description of what the function does and includes examples of how to use it.

To use the function, you can call it with a list as an argument. For example, `incr_list([1, 2, 3])` will return `[2, 3, 4]`, and `incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])` will return `[6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]`.

In both cases, the function creates a new list where each element from the input list is incremented by 1.

Here's an example of how you can use the function:

```python
print(incr_list([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: [2, 3, 4]
print(incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]))  # Output: [6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]
```
