The function incr_list takes a list as an input and returns a new list with all the elements incremented by 1.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. The function incr_list is defined with a single parameter, l, which is the input list.
2. The function uses a list comprehension to create a new list. The comprehension iterates over each element in the input list and adds 1 to it. The resulting value is added to the new list.
3. The newly created list is then returned as the output of the function.
4. The function includes a couple of example tests using the doctest module to demonstrate its correctness. These tests pass when the function is correctly implemented.

Here's an example usage of the incr_list function:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
result = incr_list(my_list)
print(result)  # Output: [2, 3, 4]
```

In this example, the input list [1, 2, 3] is passed to the incr_list function, which returns the new list [2, 3, 4]. The result is then printed to the console.
