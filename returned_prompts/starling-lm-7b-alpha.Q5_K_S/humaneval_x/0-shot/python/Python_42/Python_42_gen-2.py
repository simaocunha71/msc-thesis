The function `incr_list` takes a list as an argument and returns a new list with each element incremented by one. The function uses a list comprehension to create the new list, where each element `i` in the original list `l` is incremented by one (`i + 1`). Here's a breakdown of how the function works:

- The function `incr_list` is defined with a single parameter `l`, which represents the input list.
- The function uses a list comprehension to create a new list. The list comprehension iterates over each element `i` in the original list `l` and adds 1 to each element (`i + 1`).
- The new list is then returned by the function.

Here are some example usage of the `incr_list` function:

- When the function is called with the argument `[1, 2, 3]`, it returns `[2, 3, 4]`.
- When the function is called with the argument `[5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]`, it returns `[6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]`.

Note that the function modifies the original list by incrementing each element by one, and returns the modified list as the result.
