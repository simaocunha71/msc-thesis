The code defines a function `incr_list` that takes a list as an input and returns a new list with each element incremented by 1. The function uses a list comprehension to create the new list, where each element is obtained by adding 1 to the corresponding element in the input list. The function is tested with two sample inputs, and the expected output is provided as comments next to the test cases.

To use the function, you can simply call it and pass a list as an argument. For example:
```python
result = incr_list([1, 2, 3])
print(result)  # Output: [2, 3, 4]
```

In this example, the function `incr_list` is called with the list `[1, 2, 3]`. The returned value, which is a new list with each element incremented by 1, is stored in the variable `result`. Finally, the `print` statement is used to display the value of `result`, which will be `[2, 3, 4]`.

You can replace the list `[1, 2, 3]` with any other list of your choice to obtain the desired incremented list.
