Here's a function that checks whether the elements of a list are monotonically increasing or decreasing:

```python
def monotonic(l: list):
    return all(x <= y for x, y in zip(l, l[1:])) or all(x >= y for x, y in zip(l, l[1:]))
```

Here's how this function works:

- The `zip` function is used to iterate through the list `l` in pairs.
- The `all` function is used to check whether all pairs in the list satisfy a condition.
- If all pairs satisfy the condition that the first element is less than or equal to the second element, the function returns `True`. This means that the list is monotonically increasing.
- If none of the pairs satisfy this condition, the function checks whether all pairs satisfy the condition that the first element is greater than or equal to the second element. This means that the list is monotonically decreasing.
- If this condition is also not satisfied, the function returns `False`. This means that the list is not monotonically increasing or decreasing.

In the provided examples:

- The list `[1, 2, 4, 20]` is monotonically increasing because all pairs of consecutive elements satisfy the condition that the first element is less than or equal to the second element.
- The list `[1, 20, 4, 10]` is not monotonically increasing or decreasing because the pair `(20, 4)` does not satisfy this condition.
- The list `[4, 1, 0, -10]` is monotonically decreasing because all pairs of consecutive elements satisfy the condition that the first element is greater than or equal to the second element.
