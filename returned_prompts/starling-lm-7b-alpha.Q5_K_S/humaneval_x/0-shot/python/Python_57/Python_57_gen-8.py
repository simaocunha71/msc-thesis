The function `monotonic` takes a list as input and returns True if the elements in the list are either all increasing or all decreasing. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the function works:

1. The function first checks if the difference between the first element and the second element in the list is either positive or zero. If it's positive, the function sets the variable `decreasing` to True; otherwise, it sets `decreasing` to False.
2. Next, the function checks if the difference between the second element and the third element in the list is either positive or zero. If it's positive and `decreasing` is True, the function returns False, indicating that the list is not monotonically increasing or decreasing.
3. If the difference between the second and third elements is zero, the function continues to the next step.
4. The function then compares the difference between the first and second elements with the difference between the third and fourth elements. If the difference between the first and second elements is greater than the difference between the third and fourth elements, the function returns False. Otherwise, it continues to the next step.
5. The function compares the difference between the second and third elements with the difference between the fourth and fifth elements. If the difference between the second and third elements is less than the difference between the fourth and fifth elements, the function returns False. Otherwise, it continues to the next step.
6. The function continues this process, comparing the differences between adjacent elements in the list, until it reaches the end of the list.
7. If the function has not returned False at any point, it returns True, indicating that the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing.
8. The function's docstring provides several examples to demonstrate its usage and expected output.

Here are some example usages of the `monotonic` function:

- `monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20])` returns True because the elements in the list are monotonically increasing.
- `monotonic([1, 20, 4, 10])` returns False because the elements in the list are not monotonically increasing or decreasing.
- `monotonic([4, 1, 0, -10])` returns True because the elements in the list are monoton
