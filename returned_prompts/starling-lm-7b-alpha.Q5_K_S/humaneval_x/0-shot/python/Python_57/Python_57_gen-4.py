The function monotonic checks if the elements in the list l are either monotonically increasing or decreasing. It does this by comparing the current element with the next element in the list. If the current element is greater than the next element, the function returns False. If the current element is less than the next element, the function returns True. If the current element is equal to the next element, the function continues to the next pair of elements until it finds a pair that is not equal. If all pairs are equal, the function returns True. Here are some examples of the function's usage:

```python
print(monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20]))  # True
print(monotonic([1, 20, 4, 10]))  # False
print(monotonic([4, 1, 0, -10]))  # True
```

The function uses a for loop to iterate through the list l. It initializes a variable i to 0, which represents the index of the current element. It also initializes a variable j to 1, which represents the index of the next element. It then compares the elements at indices i and j. If the element at index i is greater than the element at index j, the function returns False. If the element at index i is less than the element at index j, the function returns True. If the element at index i is equal to the element at index j, the function updates i and j to the next pair of elements and continues the loop. If all pairs of elements are equal, the function returns True.

The function returns True if all elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing, and False otherwise.

```python
def monotonic(l: list):
    i = 0
    j = 1
    while j < len(l):
        if l[i] > l[j]:
            return False
        elif l[i] < l[j]:
            return True
        else:
            i += 1
            j += 1
    return True
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.
