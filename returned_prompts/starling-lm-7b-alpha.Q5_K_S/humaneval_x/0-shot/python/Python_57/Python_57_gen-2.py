Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. The `monotonic` function takes a list `l` as input.
2. It first checks if the length of the list is less than or equal to 2. If so, it returns True because a list with only one element or no elements is considered monotonically increasing.
3. Next, it checks if the difference between consecutive elements in the list is the same. If the difference is the same, it means the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing, and it returns True.
4. If the condition in step 3 is not met, it means that the difference between consecutive elements is not consistent, and the list is not monotonically increasing or decreasing. In this case, it returns False.
5. The `monotonic` function is tested with some example lists to verify its correctness. The expected output for each test case is provided in the comments next to the test case.

Overall, the `monotonic` function checks if the elements in a list are monotonically increasing or decreasing by comparing the differences between consecutive elements. It returns True if the condition is met and False otherwise.







def monotonic(l: list):
    if len(l) <= 2:
        return True
    return all(l[i+1] - l[i] == l[i+2] - l[i+1] for i in range(len(l)-2))

# Testing
print(monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20]))  # True
print(monotonic([1, 20, 4, 10]))  # False
print(monotonic([4, 1, 0, -10]))  # True
