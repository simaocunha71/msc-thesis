The code provided is a function named `triangle_area` that takes two arguments: `a` (the length of a side) and `h` (the height of the triangle). The function calculates and returns the area of the triangle using the formula: area = 0.5 * base * height.

To test the function, you can use a `doctest` statement with the `>>>` syntax. In the provided example, `triangle_area(5, 3)` is called and the expected result is `7.5`. 

To run the test, you can use the `doctest` module in Python. Here's an example of how to use it:

```python
from doctest import testmod

testmod()
```

This will run all the doctests in the current module and print the result. If the tests pass, it will display "0 tests in __main__; 0 passed and 0 failed." If any test fails, it will show the specific error message and the line where the error occurred.

You can customize the doctests by adding additional test cases to the `triangle_area` function. For example, you can add tests for different side lengths and heights to ensure the function works correctly in various scenarios.

```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Given length of a side and high return area for a triangle.
    >>> triangle_area(5, 3)
    7.5
    >>> triangle_area(6, 4)
    9.0
    >>> triangle_area(7, 5)
    17.5
    """

    return 0.5 * a * h
```

Then, you can run the doctests again to verify if the new test cases pass or fail.

```python
from doctest import testmod

testmod()
```

This way, you can ensure the correctness of your function by testing it with different input values.

```python
