The area of a triangle is calculated by the formula:

    area = (1/2) * base * height

In this case, the base of the triangle is given as `a` and the height is given as `h`. So, the area of the triangle can be calculated by:

    area = (1/2) * a * h

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Define the function `triangle_area` that takes two parameters `a` and `h` (length of a side and height of a triangle, respectively).
2. Inside the function, calculate the area of the triangle using the formula: `area = (1/2) * a * h`.
3. Return the calculated area.
4. Test the function with different values for `a` and `h` to ensure that the function is working correctly.

For example, if `a` is 5 and `h` is 3, the area of the triangle would be `(1/2) * 5 * 3 = 7.5`.
