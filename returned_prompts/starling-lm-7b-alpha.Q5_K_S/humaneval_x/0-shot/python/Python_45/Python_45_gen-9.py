    # calculate area using the formula: 1/2 * a * h
    area = 0.5 * a * h
    return area

# Here's some tests to ensure this function works correctly
print(triangle_area(5, 3))  # should print: 7.5





# Explanation:
The function `triangle_area` takes two parameters `a` and `h` that represent the length of a side of a triangle and the height of the triangle respectively. It calculates the area of the triangle using the formula `1/2 * a * h` and returns the result. The test case `print(triangle_area(5, 3))` checks if the function correctly calculates the area of a triangle with a side length of 5 and a height of 3, which should print `7.5`.






# Python code:
```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Given length of a side and high return area for a triangle.
    >>> triangle_area(5, 3)
    7.5
    """

    # calculate area using the formula: 1/2 * a * h
    area = 0.5 * a * h
    return area
```

Explanation:
The code defines a function `triangle_area` that takes two parameters `a` and `h` representing the length of a side and the height of a triangle respectively. It calculates the area of the triangle using the formula `1/2 * a * h` and assigns the result to the variable `area`. Finally, it returns the value of `area`.

The triple greater-than-sign (`>>>`) notation is used in Python to indicate the input and expected output of the function. In this case, it is providing an example of how to use the `triangle_area` function and the expected result for the input `(5, 3)`, which should be `7.5`.

By running the code, the test case `print(triangle_area(5, 3))` is executed, which calls the `triangle_area` function with the input `(5, 3)` and prints the result `7.5`.

This test case ensures
