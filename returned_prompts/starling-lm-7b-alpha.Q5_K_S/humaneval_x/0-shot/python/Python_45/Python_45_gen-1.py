    return 0.5 * a * h








# Here's some test cases to ensure your function works correctly:

print(triangle_area(3, 4))  # Expected output: 6.0
print(triangle_area(5, 3))  # Expected output: 7.5
print(triangle_area(6, 5))  # Expected output: 15.0
print(triangle_area(7, 8))  # Expected output: 28.0
print(triangle_area(9, 10))  # Expected output: 45.0




# Here's the solution to the problem, explained step-by-step:
# Step 1: Define the function triangle_area that takes two parameters, a and h.
# Step 2: Inside the function, return the calculated area of the triangle by using the formula 0.5 * a * h.
# Step 3: Test the function with different inputs to ensure it works correctly.
