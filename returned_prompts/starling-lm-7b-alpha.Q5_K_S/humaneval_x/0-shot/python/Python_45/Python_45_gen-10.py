The triangle area function takes in two parameters: the length of a side of the triangle (a) and the height of the triangle (h). It then calculates the area of the triangle using the formula: (1/2) * base * height.

In the example given, when the function is called with arguments 5 (for the length of the side) and 3 (for the height), it returns 7.5, which is the area of the triangle.

You can use this function to calculate the area of a triangle by passing in the appropriate values for the length of the side and the height.

Here's an example of how you can use the function:

```python
print(triangle_area(5, 3))  # Output: 7.5
```

This will print the area of the triangle with a side length of 5 and a height of 3, which is 7.5.
