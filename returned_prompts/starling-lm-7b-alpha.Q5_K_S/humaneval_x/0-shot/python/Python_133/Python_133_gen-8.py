Explanation:
The function `sum_squares` takes a list of numbers as an input and returns the sum of squared numbers in the given list.
First, we round up each element in the list to the upper integer using a list comprehension and storing the result in the variable `lst`.
Then, we square each element in the `lst` using a generator expression and calculate the sum using the `sum` function.
Finally, we return the sum of squared numbers.
The driver code tests the function with different inputs and prints the outputs.

The time complexity of this function is O(n) where n is the length of the input list, as we iterate through the list once to calculate the sum of squared numbers.
The space complexity is O(n) as we create a new list with rounded up numbers.

Note: It's important to round up each element to the upper integer before squaring, as the rounding down would give different results.

In the given examples, the function correctly calculates the sum of squared numbers after rounding up each element to the upper integer.
For `lst = [1.4, 4.2, 0]`, the output is `29` as `1.4` rounds up to `1`, `4.2` rounds up to `4`, and `0` rounds up to `0`. The sum of squares is `1^2 + 4^2 + 0^2 = 1 + 16 + 0 = 17`. However, the function
