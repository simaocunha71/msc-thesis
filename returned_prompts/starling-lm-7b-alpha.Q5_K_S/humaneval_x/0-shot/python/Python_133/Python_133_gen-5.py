The `sum_squares` function takes a list of numbers and rounds each element in the list to the upper integer. Then, it calculates the sum of the squares of all the elements in the list and returns the result. 

The function uses a list comprehension to square each element in the list and the `sum` function to calculate the sum of these squared values. 

To test the function, several test cases are provided. The expected output for each test case is also mentioned. 

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3]`, the function will round each element to the upper integer (`[1, 2, 3]`), square each element (`[1, 4, 9]`), and calculate the sum of these squared values (`14`). 

Similarly, for the input list `[1.4, 4.2, 0]`, the function will round each element to the upper integer (`[1, 4, 0]`), square each element (`[1, 16, 0]`), and calculate the sum of these squared values (`29`). 

The function can handle negative numbers as well, as shown in the test case `[-2.4, 1, 1]`. 

In this specific implementation, the function does not handle non-numeric elements in the list. If
