In the provided solution, the `filter_integers` function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each value in the `values` list. The `isinstance(x, int)` condition is used to check if the value is an instance of the `int` class. If the condition is true, the value is added to the new list that is being generated. Finally, the function returns the new list containing only the integers.

The doctest module is used to test the function. The `testmod()` function runs all the tests in the module and returns a test result object. The `failed` attribute of the test result object is checked to see if any tests have failed. If no tests have failed, the message "*** Test Suite Passed. ***" is printed.

Overall, this solution filters the given list of any Python values and only includes the integers in the new list.

Here are some additional notes:
- The `filter_integers` function takes a list of type `List[Any]` as an input and returns a list of type `List[int]`.
- The `isinstance(x, int)` function is used to check if the value `x` is an instance of the `int` class. It returns `True` if the value is an integer and `False` otherwise.
- The list comprehension `[x for x in values if isinstance(x, int)]` is used to iterate over each value in the `values` list and filter out the non-integer values. It creates a new list containing only the integers from the `values` list.
- The doctest module is used to automatically test the function. The `testmod()` function runs all the tests defined in the module and returns a test result object. The `failed` attribute of the test result object is checked to see if any tests have failed.
