Here's an explanation of the code:

The `is_nested` function takes a string `s` as input, which contains only square brackets.

Inside the function, we first check if the length of the string is less than 2. If it is, we know that there are no brackets to check for nesting, so we return `False`.

Next, we initialize an empty stack to keep track of the opening brackets.

Then, we iterate through each character in the string. If we encounter an opening bracket `[`, we add it to the stack.

If we encounter a closing bracket `]`, we check if the stack is not empty. If the stack is not empty, it means we have found a valid nested sequence of brackets, so we pop the top element from the stack. If the stack is empty, it means there are no nested brackets, so we return `False`.

If at any point we encounter a character that is not a bracket, we know that the string is not valid, so we return `False`.

Finally, after iterating through all the characters in the string, if the stack is not empty, it means there are still unclosed brackets, so we return `False`. If the stack is empty, it means all the brackets are closed correctly, so we return `True`.

By using this approach, we can determine if there is a valid subsequence of brackets with at least one nested bracket in the
