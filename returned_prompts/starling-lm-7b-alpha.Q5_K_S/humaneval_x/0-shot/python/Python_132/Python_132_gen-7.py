# Explanation:

# The function first initializes an empty stack to keep track of the opening brackets encountered.
# Then, it iterates through each character in the string. If the character is an opening bracket ('['), it is pushed onto the stack.
# If the character is a closing bracket (']'), the function checks if the stack is empty. If it is, it means that there is no valid subsequence of brackets with nested brackets, so it returns True.
# If the stack is not empty, the function checks if the last character in the stack is an opening bracket. If it is, it means that there is at least one nested bracket in the subsequence, so the function returns True.
# If the last character in the stack is not an opening bracket, it means that the closing bracket does not match the opening bracket in the stack, so the function returns True.
# If the function has iterated through all the characters in the string without returning True, it means that there are no nested brackets in the string, so it returns False.

# Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string.
# Space complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string.
