# Explanation
# The function uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets encountered. 
# When an opening bracket is encountered, it is added to the stack. 
# When a closing bracket is encountered, if the stack is not empty (meaning there is at least one opening bracket that has been nested), 
# the top element of the stack is popped. If the stack is empty, it means that there is no opening bracket that has been nested, 
# and the function returns True. 
# If the stack is not empty after iterating through all the characters in the string, 
# it means that there is at least one opening bracket that has been nested, 
# and the function returns False.


# Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string. 
# Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string.

# Note: This solution only works if the input string contains only square brackets. 
# If the input string can contain other characters, additional checks and modifications to the code are needed.
