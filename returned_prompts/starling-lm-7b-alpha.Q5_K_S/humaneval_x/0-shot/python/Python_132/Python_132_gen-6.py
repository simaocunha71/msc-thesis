Here is a step by step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize a stack with a capacity equal to the length of the string. This will be used to store the opening brackets.

2. Initialize a variable `n_opened` to keep track of the number of opened brackets.

3. Iterate through the string and for every opened bracket, append it to the stack. If the string is a closed bracket, check if the stack is not empty and the top bracket in the stack is an opening bracket. If so, pop the top bracket from the stack. If the stack is empty, return False.

4. If the length of the stack after processing the string is greater than 0, return True as there are at least one bracket in the subsequence is nested.

5. If the length of the stack is 0, return False as there are no nested brackets.

Here is the Python code that implements the steps:

```python
def is_nested(string):
    stack = []
    n_opened = 0
    for bracket in string:
        if bracket == '[':
            stack.append(bracket)
            n_opened += 1
        elif bracket == ']':
            if stack:
                if stack[-1] == '[':
                    stack.pop()
                else:
                    return False
            else:
                return False
    if stack:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

This function has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string.

You can test the function with the provided test cases:

```python
print(is_nested('[[]]'))  # True
print(is_nested('[]]]]]]][[[[[]'))  # False
print(is_nested('[][]'))  # False
print(is_nested('[]'))  # False
print(is_nested('[[][]]'))  # True
print(is_nested('[[]][['))  # True
```

The function should return True for the first three cases and False for the last three.
