# Here's a solution using a stack to keep track of the open brackets. We'll iterate through the string and if an open bracket is encountered, we'll add it to the stack. If a closing bracket is encountered, we'll check if the stack is empty or if the last open bracket on the stack doesn't match the current closing bracket. If either of these conditions is true, we'll return False, indicating that there's no valid subsequence of brackets with nesting. If we reach the end of the string and the stack is not empty, we'll return True, indicating that there's at least one open bracket that's not closed, meaning there's a valid subsequence with nesting. Otherwise, if the stack is empty, we'll return False, indicating that there's no nesting.

def is_nested(string):
    stack = deque()
    for char in string:
        if char == "[":
            stack.append(char)
        elif char == "]":
            if len(stack) == 0 or stack[-1] != "[":
                return False
            else:
                stack.pop()
    return len(stack) > 0

# Here's a breakdown of the code:

# We create a deque (double-ended queue) to store the open brackets. This data structure allows us to add (append) or remove (pop) elements from both ends, which is useful for our purposes.

# We iterate through each character in the input string using a for loop.

# If the character is an open bracket (i.e., "["), we add it to the stack using the append() method.

# If the character is a closing bracket (i.e., "]"), we check if the stack is empty using the len() function. If the stack is empty, it means there's no open bracket to close, so we can immediately return False, indicating that there's no valid subsequence of brackets with nesting.

# If the stack is not empty, we check if the last open bracket on the stack (the last element) is not a match for the current closing bracket (i.e., it's
