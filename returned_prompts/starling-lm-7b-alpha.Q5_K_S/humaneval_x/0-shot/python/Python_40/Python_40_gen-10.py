# Problem:
# triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
# it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
# sum to zero, and False otherwise.

# Correct Solution:
# Here is a Correct Solution for the problem

# Explanation:
# First, we sort the list to make sure the elements are in ascending order.
# Then we use two nested for loops to iterate over all possible pairs of elements.
# Inside these loops, we calculate the third element needed to sum to zero and check if this element is in the remaining part of the list.
# If it is, we return True, as we have found three distinct elements that sum to zero.
# If not, we continue to the next pair of elements.
# If no such pair is found, we return False, as no three elements sum to zero.

# Time Complexity: O(n^2), where n is the length of the input list.
# This is because we have two nested for loops, each iterating over the entire input list.

# Space Complexity: O(1), constant space.
# This is because we do not use any extra space that grows with the size of the input list.

# Test Cases:
# You can test your implementation using the following test cases.
# Make sure your implementation passes all of them. If it does not, debug it until it does.
# Then you can be confident that your implementation is correct.

# >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0])
# False
