This function takes a string as input, which represents musical notes in a special ASCII format. It then uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters in the string and assigns a value to each note based on the ASCII format legend provided. The resulting list of integers represents the number of beats each note lasts.

In the provided example, the function is called with the string 'o o| .| o| o| o.'. The function correctly parses this string and returns [4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4], which represents the number of beats for each note in the string.

The function is also called with the string 'o| .| .|', and it correctly parses this string and returns [2, 1, 1], which represents the number of beats for each note in the string.

Overall, the function effectively parses the input string and returns a list of integers representing the number of beats for each note.
