def car_race_collision(n: int):
    return n

# Explanation:
# There are no collisions in this situation. Each car is going to the opposite direction of another car, hence they will never collide.
# As such, the function returns the number of cars (n) as there are no collisions.


# Time complexity : O(1)
# Space complexity: O(1)
