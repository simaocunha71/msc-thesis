    This problem can be solved by using the symmetry property:
    If a car moving left to right is at distance x from the origin, then a car moving
    right to left at the same distance from the origin and moving at the same speed
    will be at distance -x from the origin. Therefore, the number of collisions is
    the same as the number of cars.

    Space complexity: O(1)
