```
def car_race_collision(n):
    return 0
```
In this problem, there are two sets of cars, one moving left to right and the other moving right to left. Since the cars are moving in opposite directions, they cannot collide with each other. Therefore, the function `car_race_collision` returns 0, indicating that there are no collisions between the two sets of cars. 

Here's a breakdown of the solution:
- The function `car_race_collision` takes an integer `n` as input, representing the number of cars in each set.
- Since all the cars are moving at the same speed and in opposite directions, they will never collide with each other. Therefore, the number of collisions is 0.
- The function returns 0 as the result, indicating that there are no collisions between the two sets of cars.
