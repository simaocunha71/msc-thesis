def car_race_collision(n):
    # This function returns the number of collisions,
    # as the left and right moving cars collide but continue
    # moving as if they didn't.
    # The n cars move left to right at the same speed,
    # while the n cars move right to left at the same speed

    # Since all cars are moving at the same speed,
    # after n cars have moved left to right, the n cars moving
    # right to left will have moved the same distance

    # Therefore, there will be a collision every time a car moving
    # left to right is directly in front of a car moving right to left

    # This is equivalent to saying there will be a collision every time
    # the index of the car moving left to right is the same as the index
    # of the car moving right to left

    # So the number of collisions is equivalent to the number of cars
    return n
