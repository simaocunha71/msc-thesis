# Tests:
# vowels_count("abcde")  =>  2
# vowels_count("ACEDY")  =>  3
# vowels_count("abcy")   =>  2
# vowels_count("abcyz")  =>  3
# vowels_count("")       =>  0

The above Python program defines a function `vowels_count` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the number of vowels in the string. Vowels in this case are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'. Here, 'y' is also a vowel, but only when it is at the end of the given word.

The function `vowels_count` initializes a string variable `vowels` with the vowels 'aeiouy'. It also initializes an integer variable `count` to 0. The function then iterates over each character `c` in the input string `s`. If `c` is in the `vowels` string, the `count` is incremented by 1. Finally, the function returns the value of `count`.

The provided test cases verify the correctness of the `vowels_count` function. The first test case `vowels_count("abcde")` should return 2, as there are two vowels ('a' and 'e') in the string "abcde". The second test case `vowels_count("ACEDY")` should return 3, as there are three vowels ('a', 'e', and 'y') in the string
