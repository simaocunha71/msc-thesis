# Add more test cases as per the FIX

```
In this implementation, a list called `vowels` is created to store all the vowels. Then, a counter variable `count` is initialized to 0. The function then iterates over each character in the input string `s`. If the character `ch` is present in the `vowels` list, the counter `count` is incremented by 1. Finally, the function returns the total count of vowels in the input string.

The test cases provided at the end of the code demonstrate the functionality of the `vowels_count` function. They cover different scenarios, including cases with lowercase and uppercase vowels, and cases where 'y' is a vowel.

To add more test cases, you can follow the same pattern as the existing test cases. Define a string to be passed as input to the `vowels_count` function and then compare the expected output with the actual output of the function using the `print` statement.

For example, you can add a test case like this:
```python
print(vowels_count("xyz"))  # Expected Output: 0
```
In this case, the input string "xyz" does not contain any vowels, so the expected output is 0. By running the code, you can verify if the `vowels_count` function correctly returns 0 for this test case.

Remember to update the `FIX`
