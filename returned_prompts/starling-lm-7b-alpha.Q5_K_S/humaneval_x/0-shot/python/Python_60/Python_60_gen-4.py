To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, which is given by the equation:

sum = n * (n + 1) / 2

Here, n is the number we want to sum up to. We can plug n into the equation and return the result as the sum of the series.

Here's an implementation of the function in Python:

```python
def sum_to_n(n: int):
    return n * (n + 1) // 2
```

You can test the function with different values of n to verify that it works correctly. For example:

```python
print(sum_to_n(30))  # Output: 465
print(sum_to_n(100))  # Output: 5050
print(sum_to_n(5))  # Output: 15
print(sum_to_n(10))  # Output: 55
print(sum_to_n(1))  # Output: 1
```

The function correctly calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to n using the arithmetic series formula.
