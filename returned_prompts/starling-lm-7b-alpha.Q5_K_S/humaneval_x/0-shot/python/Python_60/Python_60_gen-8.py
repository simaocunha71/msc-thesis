To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

sum = n * (n + 1) / 2

where n is the last number in the series. In this case, since the series starts from 1, we can substitute n with n - 1:

sum = (n - 1) * n / 2

Here is the code implementation:

def sum_to_n(n: int):
    """sum_to_n is a function that sums numbers from 1 to n.
    >>> sum_to_n(30)
    465
    >>> sum_to_n(100)
    5050
    >>> sum_to_n(5)
    15
    >>> sum_to_n(10)
    55
    >>> sum_to_n(1)
    1
    """
    return (n - 1) * n // 2

By using this formula, we can efficiently calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n in constant time.
