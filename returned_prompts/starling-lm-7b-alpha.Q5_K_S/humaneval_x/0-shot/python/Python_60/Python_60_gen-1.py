In this code, the function sum_to_n is defined to take an integer parameter n. This function calculates the sum of all the numbers from 1 to n using the formula n*(n+1)/2. This formula is derived from the arithmetic series. The function then returns the calculated sum.

The function is tested with several test cases to verify its correctness. The expected output is provided in the comments after each test case. The function correctly calculates and returns the sum of numbers from 1 to n for all the test cases.

To use this function, you can simply call it with an integer argument. For example, sum_to_n(30) will return 465, sum_to_n(100) will return 5050, and so on.

Here's an example of how you can use this function:

```python
print(sum_to_n(30))  # Output: 465
print(sum_to_n(100))  # Output: 5050
print(sum_to_n(5))  # Output: 15
print(sum_to_n(10))  # Output: 55
print(sum_to_n(1))  # Output: 1
```

This function can be used to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n in a quick and efficient manner.
