To solve this problem, you can define a function called `sum_to_n` that takes an integer `n` as input. The function will calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to `n` using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `n * (n + 1) / 2`. Here's an example implementation of the function:

```python
def sum_to_n(n: int):
    return n * (n + 1) // 2
```

You can test the function using the provided examples:
```python
print(sum_to_n(30))  # Output: 465
print(sum_to_n(100))  # Output: 5050
print(sum_to_n(5))  # Output: 15
print(sum_to_n(10))  # Output: 55
print(sum_to_n(1))  # Output: 1
```

The function `sum_to_n` takes an integer `n` as input and uses the formula `n * (n + 1) // 2` to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to `n`. The `//` operator is used to perform integer division, ensuring that the result is an integer.

By calling the function with different values of `n`, you can obtain the sum of numbers from 1 to `n`. For example, `sum_to_n(30)` will return 465, as the sum of numbers from 1 to 30 is 1 + 2 + ... + 30 = 465.

The function can handle any positive integer value of `n`.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.
