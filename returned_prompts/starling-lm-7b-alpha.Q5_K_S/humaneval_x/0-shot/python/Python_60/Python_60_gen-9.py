To solve this problem, you can use a simple mathematical formula to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. Define a function called sum_to_n that takes an integer parameter called n.
2. Inside the function, calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n using the formula: (n * (n + 1)) / 2. This formula is based on the concept of arithmetic series.
3. Return the calculated sum as the result of the function.
4. Test the function with various input values to ensure it works correctly.

Here's the code for the solution:

```python
def sum_to_n(n: int):
    """sum_to_n is a function that sums numbers from 1 to n.
    >>> sum_to_n(30)
    465
    >>> sum_to_n(100)
    5050
    >>> sum_to_n(5)
    15
    >>> sum_to_n(10)
    55
    >>> sum_to_n(1)
    1
    """
    return (n * (n + 1)) // 2
```

You can test the function by calling it with different values of n and verifying the output. For example:

```python
print(sum_to_n(30))  # Output: 465
print(sum_to_n(100)) # Output: 5050
print(sum_to_n(5))   # Output: 15
print(sum_to_n(10))  # Output: 55
print(sum_to_n(1))   # Output: 1
```

This function provides an efficient and accurate solution to summing numbers from 1 to n.
