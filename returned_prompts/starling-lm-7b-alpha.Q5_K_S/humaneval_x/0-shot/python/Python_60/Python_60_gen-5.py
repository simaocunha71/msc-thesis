To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Define a function called `sum_to_n` that takes an integer `n` as input.
2. Inside the function, initialize a variable `sum` to 0. This variable will be used to store the sum of numbers from 1 to `n`.
3. Use a `for` loop to iterate through the range from 1 to `n+1`. In each iteration, add the current number to the `sum` variable.
4. After the loop, return the value of `sum`.
5. Test the function with different values of `n` to ensure it works correctly.

Here's an example implementation:

```python
def sum_to_n(n: int):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        sum += i
    return sum
```

You can now use the `sum_to_n` function to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to `n`. For example:

```python
print(sum_to_n(30))  # Output: 465
print(sum_to_n(100))  # Output: 5050
print(sum_to_n(5))  # Output: 15
print(sum_to_n(10))  # Output: 55
print(sum_to_n(1))  # Output: 1
```

This implementation of the `sum_to_n` function correctly calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to `n`.
