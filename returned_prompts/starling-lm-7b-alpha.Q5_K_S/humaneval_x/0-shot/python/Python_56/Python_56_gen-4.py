In order to determine whether every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, we can use a stack. We iterate over the string and push an opening bracket onto the stack. If we encounter a closing bracket, we pop the stack. If we reach the end of the string and the stack is empty, we return True; otherwise, we return False.

Here's a step-by-step walkthrough of the solution:

1. Initialize an empty stack.
2. Iterate over each character in the string.
3. If the character is an opening bracket ("<"), push it onto the stack.
4. If the character is a closing bracket (">"), pop the stack. If the stack is empty at this point, return False; otherwise, continue to the next step.
5. After iterating through all characters in the string, if the stack is empty, return True; otherwise, return False.

Here's the Python code implementing the above steps:

def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    stack = []
    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket == "<":
            stack.append(bracket)
        elif bracket == ">":
            if not stack:
                return False
            stack.pop()
    return not stack

To test the function, you can use the following test cases:

>>> correct_bracketing("<")
False
>>> correct_bracketing("<>")
True
>>> correct_bracketing("<<><>>")
True
>>> correct_bracketing("><<>")
False

In the first test case, the string "<" only has an opening bracket, so the stack is not empty at the end, and the function returns False.

In the second test case, the string "<>" has an opening bracket followed by a closing bracket, so the stack is empty at the end, and the function returns True.

In the third test case, the string "<<><>>" has two opening brackets followed by two closing brackets, so the stack is empty at the end, and the function returns True.

In the fourth test case, the string "><<>" has an opening bracket followed by two closing brackets, so the stack is not empty at the end, and the function
