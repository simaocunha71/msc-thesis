Opening brackets: "<" and "("
Closing brackets: ">" and ")"

Here is a step-by-step guide:

1. Initialize an empty stack.

2. Iterate through the string one character at a time. For each character, do the following:

    a. If the character is an opening bracket ("<" or "("), push it onto the stack.

    b. If the character is a closing bracket (">" or ")"), pop the stack and compare the popped item with the current character.

    c. If the characters match, continue with the next character. If they don't match, return False.

3. At the end of the iteration, if the stack is empty, return True. Otherwise, return False.

Here's the Python implementation of the above steps:

```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    stack = []

    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket == "<" or bracket == "(":
            stack.append(bracket)
        elif bracket == ">" or bracket == ")":
            if stack == []:
                return False
            elif stack[-1] == "<" and bracket == ">" or stack[-1] == "(" and bracket == ")":
                stack.pop()
            else:
                return False
    return stack == []
```

This implementation works in O(n) time, where n is the length of the input string.
