In order to solve the problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Initialize an empty stack.
2. Iterate through the brackets string.
3. For each bracket, check if it is an opening bracket (i.e., "<") and push it onto the stack, or if it is a closing bracket (i.e., ">") and check if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack is an opening bracket that matches the current closing bracket. If so, pop the top of the stack. If not, return False.
4. If the stack is empty at the end of the iteration, return True. Otherwise, return False.

Here is the Python code that implements the above steps:

```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    stack = []
    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket == "<":
            stack.append(bracket)
        elif bracket == ">":
            if stack:
                stack.pop()
            else:
                return False
    return not stack
```

To test the function, you can use the following test cases:

```python
print(correct_bracketing("<"))  # False
print(correct_bracketing("<>"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing("<<><>>"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing("><<>"))  # False
```

These test cases will confirm that the function correctly identifies whether the bracketing is correct or not.
