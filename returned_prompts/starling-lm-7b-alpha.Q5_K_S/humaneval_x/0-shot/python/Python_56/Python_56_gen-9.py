To solve this problem, we will use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets encountered.

Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Initialize an empty stack.
2. Iterate over the string of brackets.
3. If the bracket is an opening bracket "<", push it onto the stack.
4. If the bracket is a closing bracket ">", pop the top element from the stack. If the stack is empty, this is invalid, and we return False. If the popped element is not a matching opening bracket, this is also invalid, and we return False. Otherwise, continue to the next bracket.
5. If we have iterated over all brackets and the stack is empty, the bracketing is correct and we return True. Otherwise, the stack is not empty, which means some opening brackets do not have a closing bracket, and we return False.

Here is the Python code that implements these steps:

def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    stack = []
    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket == "<":
            stack.append(bracket)
        elif bracket == ">":
            if not stack:
                return False
            stack.pop()
    return not stack


Now let's test the function with some examples:

print(correct_bracketing("<"))  # False
print(correct_bracketing("<>"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing("<<><>>"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing("><<>"))  # False
