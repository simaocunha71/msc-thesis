In order to solve the problem, we need to know how to check if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:

1. Initialize an empty dictionary called `brackets_count`. This dictionary will keep track of how many opening brackets and closing brackets we have seen so far.

2. Iterate over each bracket in the `brackets` string. For each bracket:
    - If the bracket is an opening bracket (i.e., "<"), increment the count of opening brackets in the `brackets_count` dictionary.
    - If the bracket is a closing bracket (i.e., ">"), decrement the count of opening brackets in the `brackets_count` dictionary.

3. After iterating over all the brackets, check if the count of opening brackets is 0. If it is, then every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and we return True. Otherwise, we return False.

Here's the implementation of the above steps in Python:

```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:
    opening_brackets = "<"
    closing_brackets = ">"
    brackets_count = {"<": 0, ">": 0}

    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket == opening_brackets:
            brackets_count[opening_brackets] += 1
        elif bracket == closing_brackets:
            brackets_count[closing_brackets] -= 1

    return brackets_count[opening_brackets] == 0
```

You can now use the `correct_bracketing` function to check if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in a given string of brackets.

For example, if you call `correct_bracketing("<>")`, it will return True because every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. On the other hand, if you call `correct_bracketing("><<>")`, it will return False because the second "<" does not have a corresponding
