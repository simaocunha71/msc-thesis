In order to solve this problem, we will use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. We will iterate through the string and, if we see an opening bracket, we will push it onto the stack. If we see a closing bracket, we will pop the top of the stack and check that it is the correct opening bracket. If it's not, then the brackets are incorrectly bracketed. If at any point we run out of opening brackets but still have closing brackets remaining in the stack, then the brackets are incorrectly bracketed.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize an empty stack.
2. Iterate through the input string.
3. For each character in the string, if it is an opening bracket ("<"):
   - Push it onto the stack.
4. For each character in the string, if it is a closing bracket (">"):
   - Pop the top of the stack and check that it is the correct opening bracket. If it's not, then the brackets are incorrectly bracketed. If the stack is empty, then the brackets are incorrectly bracketed. If the stack is not empty but the popped opening bracket does not match the closing bracket, then the brackets are incorrectly bracketed.
5. If at any point we run out of opening brackets but still have closing brackets remaining in the stack, then the brackets are incorrectly bracketed.
6. If the stack is empty at the end of the iteration, then all opening brackets have a corresponding closing bracket and the brackets are correctly bracketed. Otherwise, the brackets are incorrectly bracketed.

Here is the Python code that implements this solution:

def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    stack = []
    for char in brackets:
        if char == "<":
            stack.append(char)
        elif char == ">":
            if stack:
                top = stack.pop()
                if top != "<":
                    return False
            else:
                return False
    return not stack
