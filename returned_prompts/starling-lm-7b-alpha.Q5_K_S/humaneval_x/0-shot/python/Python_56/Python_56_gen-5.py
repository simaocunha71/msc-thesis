In order to solve the problem, we can use a stack data structure to keep track of opening brackets, and check if all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets. Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize an empty stack.
2. Iterate through each character in the input string.
3. If the character is an opening bracket ('<'), push it onto the stack.
4. If the character is a closing bracket ('>'), pop the top element from the stack. If the stack is empty at this point, return False.
5. Repeat steps 3-4 until all characters in the input string have been processed.
6. If the stack is empty at the end, return True. Otherwise, return False.

Here is the Python implementation of the above solution:

def correct_bracketing(brackets):
    stack = []
    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket == '<':
            stack.append(bracket)
        elif bracket == '>':
            if not stack:
                return False
            stack.pop()
    return not stack

# Test cases
print(correct_bracketing("<"))  # Expected output: False
print(correct_bracketing("<>"))  # Expected output: True
print(correct_bracketing("<<><>>"))  # Expected output: True
print(correct_bracketing("><<>"))  # Expected output: False


In the provided code, the function correct_bracketing takes a string of brackets as input and uses a stack data structure to keep track of opening brackets. It iterates through each character in the input string and performs the following steps:

- If the character is an opening bracket ('<'), it is pushed onto the stack using the append() method.
- If the character is a closing bracket ('>'), the top element of the stack is popped using the pop() method. If the stack is empty at this point, the function immediately returns False, indicating incorrect bracketing.
- The steps 3-4 are repeated until all characters in the input string have been processed.
- At the end of the iteration, if the stack is empty, the function returns True, indicating correct bracketing. Otherwise, it
