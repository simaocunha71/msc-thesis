The provided Python function takes a list as an argument and returns a new list with the same values at odd indices, while sorting the values at even indices. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the function works:

1. The function defines a list named `l` as a parameter.
2. It initializes an empty list `l_copy` that will store the result.
3. The function uses a for loop to iterate through the indices of the list `l`. The loop variable `i` is used to keep track of the index.
4. Inside the loop, the function checks if the index `i` is even using the modulo operator (%). If the index is even, it means the value at the even index of the list `l` should be appended to the `l_copy` list.
5. To sort the values at even indices, the function uses the `sorted()` function, which returns a new list with the sorted values from the original list.
6. The function then appends the sorted value from the `even_sorted` list to the `l_copy` list.
7. If the index `i` is odd, it means the value at the odd index of the list `l` should be appended to the `l_copy` list without any modifications.
8. After the loop is finished, the function returns the `l_copy` list, which contains the original values at odd indices and the sorted values at even indices.
9. The function includes a couple of doctest examples to demonstrate how the function should work with different inputs.

Overall, this function provides a way to sort the values at even indices of a list while leaving the values at odd indices unchanged.
