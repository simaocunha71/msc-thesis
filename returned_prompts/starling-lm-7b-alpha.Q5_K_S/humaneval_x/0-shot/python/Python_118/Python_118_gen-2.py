The function `get_closest_vowel` takes a word as input and iterates through each character in the word. It checks if the current character is a vowel and if the next character is not a vowel. If both conditions are met, the function returns the current character as the closest vowel. If no such vowel is found, the function returns an empty string.

The given test cases demonstrate the functionality of the function. For example, when the word "yogurt" is passed to the function, it returns "u" as the closest vowel that stands between two consonants. Similarly, when the word "FULL" is passed, the function returns "U" as the closest vowel.

To use this function, you can simply call it with a word as the argument, and it will return the closest vowel that meets the specified conditions.
