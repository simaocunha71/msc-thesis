Answer:
The function `get_closest_vowel` takes a word as input and returns the closest vowel that stands between two consonants from the right side of the word (case sensitive). It uses a loop to iterate through the characters of the word and checks if each character is a vowel. If a vowel is found, it checks if it is in between two consonants and assigns the vowel if it meets the condition. It also updates the previous character (`prev_char`) variable. If a vowel is not found, it returns an empty string.

For example, when the function is called with the word "yogurt", it will return "u" because it is the closest vowel that stands between two consonants from the right side of the word. Similarly, for the word "FULL", it will return "U" because it is the only vowel in the word and it is the closest vowel that stands between two consonants from the right side of the word. For the word "quick", it will return an empty string because there are no vowels between two consonants from the
