Here is a step-by-step guide to solving this problem:

1. Convert the integer to a string. This is done by using the built-in `str()` function.
2. Find the length of the string using the built-in `len()` function. This is useful for calculating the circular shift.
3. If the shift is greater than the number of digits, reverse the string and return it. This is done by using slicing (`[::-1]`) and the `return` statement.
4. If the shift is not greater than the number of digits, calculate the circular shift by using slicing and the `shift` value. The `[:-shift]` part of the slice gets the part of the string that needs to be shifted. The `[shift:]` part gets the part of the string that needs to be appended to the shifted part. Concatenate these two parts using the `+` operator and return the result.

Here is the implemented solution:

```python
def circular_shift(x, shift):
    # Step 1: Convert the integer to a string
    x_str = str(x)
    # Step 2: Find the length of the string
    len_x_str = len(x_str)
    # Step 3: If shift is greater than the number of digits, return the reversed string
    if shift > len_x_str:
        return x_str[::-1]
    else:
        # Step 4: If the shift is not greater than the number of digits, calculate the circular shift
        return x_str[:-shift] + x_str[shift:]
```

You can test the function with the provided examples:

```python
print(circular_shift(12, 1))  # "21"
print(circular_shift(12, 2))  # "12"
```

This should give you the desired output.
