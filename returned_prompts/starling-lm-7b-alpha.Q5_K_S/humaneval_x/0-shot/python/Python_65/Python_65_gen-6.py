To solve this problem, we need to first convert the integer to a string, then shift the digits to the right by shift, and finally return the result as a string.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. Convert the integer x to a string by using the str() function. This allows us to manipulate the digits easily.
2. Calculate the length of the string by using the len() function. This will help us determine the number of digits and avoid index errors when shifting the digits.
3. If the shift is greater than the length of the string, it means that the shift is greater than the number of digits. In this case, we need to reverse the digits and return the result. This can be done by using slicing with a step of -1.
4. If the shift is less than or equal to the length of the string, we can start shifting the digits to the right. We use a while loop to iterate over each character in the string.
5. Inside the loop, we check if the shift is equal to 0. If it is, we can break the loop and return the original string.
6. If the shift is not equal to 0, we concatenate the last character of the string (which is the first digit after shifting) with the remaining part of the string. This can be done by using string concatenation.
7. After each iteration, we update the shift by subtracting 1. This ensures that we shift the digits to the right by the desired amount.
8. Finally, we return the resulting string.

Here's the code implementation of the solution:

```python
def circular_shift(x, shift):
    # Convert the integer to a string
    x_str = str(x)
    # Calculate the length of the string
    length = len(x_str)
    # If shift is greater than length, reverse the digits
    if shift > length:
        return x_str[::-1]
    # Start shifting the digits to the right
    while shift:
        # If shift is 0, break the loop and return the original string
        if shift == 0:
            return x_str
        # Concatenate the last character with the remaining part of
