# Here's a step by step explanation of the code:
# 1. We create a new list called even_length_strings that only contains the strings with an even length from the original list.
# 2. We use a list comprehension to iterate over each word in the original list, and we add it to the even_length_strings list only if its length is even (i.e., if len(word) % 2 == 0).
# 3. We sort the even_length_strings list using the sorted() function, and we specify the key as len. This means that the list will be sorted based on the length of each word. If two words have the same length, they will be sorted alphabetically.
# 4. Finally, we return the sorted even_length_strings list.

# The time complexity of this code is O(n log n), where n is the length of the input list. This is because we are iterating over the list once and sorting it once, both of which have a time complexity of O(n log n).

# The space complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the length of the input list. This is because we are creating a new list to store the even-length strings, which has a space complexity of O(n).

# This solution is efficient and has a low space complexity, making it a good choice for solving the problem.



# Here's an example of how to use the function:

# lst = ["aa", "a", "aaa"]
# result = sorted_list_sum(lst)
# print(result)  # Output: ["aa"]

# lst = ["ab", "a", "aaa", "cd"]
# result = sorted_list
