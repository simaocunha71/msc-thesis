def test_sorted_list_sum():
    assert sorted_list_sum(["aa", "a", "aaa"]) == ["aa"]
    assert sorted_list_sum(["ab", "a", "aaa", "cd"]) == ["ab", "cd"]
    assert sorted_list_sum(["abc", "ab", "ac", "ba"]) == ["ab", "ac", "abc", "ba"]
    assert sorted_list_sum(["apple", "banana", "cucumber"]) == ["apple", "banana", "cucumber"]

test_sorted_list_sum()

In this solution, the function `sorted_list_sum` first filters out the strings with odd lengths using a list comprehension. It then sorts the remaining strings by length using the `sorted` function and the `key` parameter, which specifies the sorting criteria. The `key` parameter takes a function that returns a value to use for sorting. In this case, we use the `len` function to return the length of each string. If two strings have the same length, the `sorted` function uses the default sorting order, which is alphabetical.

The unit tests verify that the function works correctly by checking the expected output against the actual output of the function. The `assert` statement is used to compare the expected and actual outputs, and if they are not equal, an error is raised.

Overall, this solution efficiently deletes the strings with odd lengths and sorts the remaining strings by length and alphabetically.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

- The `sorted_list_sum` function takes a parameter `lst`, which is the list of strings to be processed.
- The `even_length_strings` list comprehension filters out the strings
