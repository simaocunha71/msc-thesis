# Time Complexity: O(1)
# Space Complexity: O(1)



# The time complexity of the function is O(1) because the function only checks 
# if the input numbers are even and performs a single return operation.

# The space complexity of the function is O(1) because the function uses a constant 
# amount of space to store the input numbers and perform its operations.



# In the given function, we first check if the second input number, y, is even by using the modulo operator (%). If y is even, we then check if y is greater than or equal to the first input number, x. If y is greater than or equal to x, we return y as the result. If y is not greater than or equal to x, we return -1 as the result. If y is not even, we immediately return -1 as the result.

# We test the function by calling it with two example input pairs: (12, 15) and (13, 12). The expected output for the first pair is 14, as 14 is the biggest even integer number in the range [12, 15] inclusive. The expected output for the second pair is -1, as there is no even integer number in the range [13, 12] inclusive.

# The time complexity of the function is O(1) because it only performs a single modulo operation and a single comparison operation, regardless of the input size. The space complexity of the function is O(1) because it only uses a constant amount of space to store the input numbers and perform its operations.
