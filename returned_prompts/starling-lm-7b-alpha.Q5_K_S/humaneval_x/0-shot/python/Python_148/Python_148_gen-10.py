# Explanation
# The function first creates a list of indexes of the planets.
# Then it creates a list of indexes of the planets between the orbit of planet1 and planet2.
# The function then creates a tuple of the planets between the orbit of planet1 and planet2.
# Finally, the function sorts the planets by the proximity to the sun and returns the tuple of the planets.

# The function works by first creating a list of indexes of the planets, then creating a list of indexes of the planets between the orbit of planet1 and planet2, then creating a tuple of the planets between the orbit of planet1 and planet2, and finally sorting the planets by the proximity to the sun and returning the tuple of the planets.

# The function returns an empty tuple if planet1 or planet2 are not correct planet names, which is done by checking if the
