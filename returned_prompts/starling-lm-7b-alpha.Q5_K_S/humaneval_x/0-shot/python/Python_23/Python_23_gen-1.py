The strlen function takes a string as an argument and returns the length of the string. Here's the code for the function:

```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Return length of given string
    >>> strlen('')
    0
    >>> strlen('abc')
    3
    """
    return len(string)
```

To use the strlen function, you can simply call it with a string as an argument. For example, if you want to find the length of the string "abc", you can do:

```python
print(strlen('abc'))  # Output: 3
```

The len() function is a built-in Python function that returns the number of items in an object. In this case, the object is a string, so the len() function counts the number of characters in the string.

The strlen function is a simple and efficient way to find the length of a string in Python. It's particularly useful when you need to perform operations based on the length of a string, such as truncating or padding it.

Here are some additional examples of how you can use the strlen function:

```python
print(strlen(''))  # Output: 0
print(strlen('Hello, World!')))  # Output: 13
print(strlen('1234567890'))  # Output: 10
```

In summary, the strlen function is a convenient and straightforward way to determine the length of a string in Python. It can be used in various applications, such as string manipulation, data validation, and text processing.
