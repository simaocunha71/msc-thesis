The strlen function is a Python function that takes a string as an input and returns the length of the string. The length of a string is the number of characters it contains. In the code example provided, the strlen function is defined with a single parameter called "string" of type str. The function body consists of a single return statement that returns the length of the string using the built-in len() function.

To test the strlen function, you can use the doctest module in Python. The doctest module allows you to write test cases directly in the function documentation string. In the code example, the test cases are written as comments starting with ">>>" followed by the expected output. For example, the test case "strlen('')" is expected to return 0, and the test case "strlen('abc')" is expected to return 3.

To run the doctest, you can use the doctest.testmod() function. This function runs all the test cases defined in the function's documentation string and prints a summary of the results.

Overall, the strlen function is a simple Python function that calculates the length of a given string using the len() function and returns the result. The doctest module is used to verify the correctness of the function implementation.

Here is the step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. Define the strlen function with a single parameter "string" of type str.
2. Inside the function body, use the len() function to calculate the length of the string and return the result.
3. Use the doctest module to write test cases for the strlen function.
4. Run the doctest.testmod() function to verify the correctness of the strlen function implementation.
