The function strlen(string: str) -> int takes a string as an argument and returns the length of the string as an integer. Here is an example of how you can use the function:

```python
# Example usage of strlen function
print(strlen(''))  # Output: 0
print(strlen('abc'))  # Output: 3
```

The function strlen(string: str) -> int uses a for loop to iterate through each character in the string and counts the number of characters in the string. The length of the string is then returned as the result. 

Here is the code for the strlen function:

```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    length = 0
    for _ in string:
        length += 1
    return length
```

You can use this function to calculate the length of any string by passing the string as an argument to the strlen function.

```python
# Example usage of strlen function
print(strlen('Hello, World!'))  # Output: 13
print(strlen('12345'))  # Output: 5
```

In the example above, strlen('Hello, World!') returns 13 because the string 'Hello, World!' contains 13 characters, including spaces and punctuation marks. Similarly, strlen('12345') returns 5 because the string '12345' contains 5 digits.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.
