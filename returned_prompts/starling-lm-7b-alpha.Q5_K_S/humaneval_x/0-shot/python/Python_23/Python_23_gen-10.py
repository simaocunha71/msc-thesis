The `strlen` function is a Python function that takes a string as an input and returns the length of the string. It uses the built-in `len()` function in Python to calculate the length of the string.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The function `strlen` is defined with a single parameter, `string`, which is of type `str`. This parameter represents the string for which we want to calculate the length.

2. Inside the function, a `return` statement is used to return the length of the `string` using the `len()` function. The `len()` function calculates the number of characters in a string.

3. The function is documented using the `""" """` style of multi-line comments. This is called a docstring, and it provides information about the function's purpose, usage, and expected output.

To test the function, you can use the `strlen` function with different strings as arguments. In the given example, it is tested with an empty string (`''`) and the string `'abc'`. The expected output is `0` and `3`, respectively.

Overall, the `strlen` function is a simple and straightforward way to calculate the length of a given string in Python.
