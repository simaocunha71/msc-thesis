Here's a solution to the problem:

```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Return length of given string
    >>> strlen('')
    0
    >>> strlen('abc')
    3
    """
    return len(string)
```

This function uses the built-in `len()` function in Python to return the length of the given string. The `len()` function takes a string as an argument and returns the number of characters in the string. 

The function `strlen` takes a string as a parameter and returns an integer representing the length of the string. 

In the provided examples, `strlen('')` returns 0 because an empty string has no characters, and `strlen('abc')` returns 3 because the string 'abc' has three characters.

You can use this function to get the length of any string in Python by passing the string as an argument to the function.

For example, if you want to get the length of the string "Hello, World!", you can call the function like this:
```python
length = strlen("Hello, World!")
print(length)  # Output: 13
```

This will print the length of the string "Hello, World!" to the console, which is 13 characters.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.
