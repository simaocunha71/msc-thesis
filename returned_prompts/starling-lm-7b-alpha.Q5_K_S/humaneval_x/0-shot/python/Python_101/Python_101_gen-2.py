Explanation:

In the given problem, you are asked to split a string into words and return an array of the words. The string of words can be separated by commas or spaces. There are multiple solutions provided to solve this problem.

The first solution uses the `split()` method in Python to split the string at the comma character. This will return a list of words separated by commas. However, this solution does not handle spaces between words.

The second solution uses the `re` module in Python to split the string using regular expressions. The regular expression `\s+` matches one or more whitespace characters, and the `split()` method is used to split the string at these characters. This solution correctly handles spaces between words.

The third solution is another variation of the second solution, which uses a different regular expression to split the string. The regular expression `',| '` matches either a comma or a space character, and the `split()` method is used to split the string at these characters. This solution also correctly handles spaces between words.

The fourth solution uses the `re` module in Python to split the string using a regular expression that matches one or more word characters. The `findall()` method is used to find all matches of this regular expression in the string, and returns a list of the matched words. This solution correctly handles both commas and spaces between words.

The fifth solution is another variation of the fourth solution, which uses a different regular expression to
