# This solution uses the split() method in Python to split the given string into words. The split() method splits a string into a list where each word is a separate item in the list. In this case, the split() method is used with the comma (',') as the separator, so each comma-separated word in the input string becomes a separate item in the returned list.

# Here's a breakdown of the solution:

# The input string is passed as the argument to the split() method, with the comma (',') as the separator. This splits the string into a list of words.
# The resulting list is then returned as the output of the function.

# The split() method in Python is a powerful tool for splitting strings into lists based on a specified separator. It can be used to easily extract information from strings and convert them into a more structured format.

# In this case, the split() method is used to split the input string into words based on the presence of commas. The resulting list is then returned as the output of the function.

# Note that this solution does not handle spaces between the commas as separators. If you need to handle spaces as well, you can modify the split() method to use a regular expression or a custom separator.

# Here are a few examples of how you can use the words_string() function:

# words_string("Hi, my name is John")  # Output: ["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "John"]
# words_string("One, two, three, four, five, six")  # Output: ["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]
# words_string("Hello world! It's a beautiful day.")  # Output: ["Hello", "world", "It's", "a", "beautiful", "day."]

# You can use this function to split strings into words and perform further operations on the resulting list of words, such as manipulating or analyzing the words for various purposes.

# It's important to note that the split() method in Python is case-sensitive, meaning it will only split the string at the exact locations of the specified separator(s
