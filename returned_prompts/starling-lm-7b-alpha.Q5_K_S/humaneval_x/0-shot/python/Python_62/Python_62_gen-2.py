To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:

1. Initialize an empty result list `result`.
2. Iterate over the coefficients from the second to the last, and for each coefficient, append the coefficient multiplied by `x` to the result list. This corresponds to taking the derivative of each term in the polynomial.
3. Append the coefficient of the first term (the last coefficient) to the result list. This is the derivative of the first term.
4. Return the result list.

Here is the Python implementation of the above algorithm:

```python
def derivative(xs):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(xs) - 1):
        result.append(xs[i + 1] * (i + 1))
    result.append(xs[0] * (len(xs)))
    return result
```

You can use the above function as follows:

```python
print(derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5]))  # Output: [1, 4, 12, 20]
print(derivative([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: [2, 6]
```
