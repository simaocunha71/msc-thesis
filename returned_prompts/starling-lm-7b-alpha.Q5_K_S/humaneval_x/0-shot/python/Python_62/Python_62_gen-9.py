To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Initialize an empty list to store the result.
2. Iterate through the input list. For each element, multiply it by its corresponding power of x (starting from 1).
3. Add the result to the list of derivatives.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each element in the input list.
5. Return the list of derivatives.

Here is an implementation of the function:

```python
def derivative(xs: list):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(xs) - 1):
        result.append(xs[i + 1] * (i + 1))
    return result
```

To test the function, you can use the provided examples:

```python
print(derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5]))  # [1, 4, 12, 20]
print(derivative([1, 2, 3]))  # [2, 6]
```

The output of the function `derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])` is `[1, 4, 12, 20]` because the derivative of `3 + x + 2x^2 + 4x^3 + 5x^4` is `1 + 4x + 12x^2 + 20x^3`.

The output of the function `derivative([1, 2, 3])` is `[2, 6]` because the derivative of `1 + 2x + 3x^2` is `2 + 6x`.
