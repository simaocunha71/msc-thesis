Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. First, we define a helper function `is_palindrome` that tests if a given string is a palindrome. It does this by comparing the string to its reverse using slicing notation `[::-1]`. If the string is the same when read forwards and backwards, then it is a palindrome and the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

2. In the `make_palindrome` function, we initialize a variable `max_palindrome` to the empty string. We will use this to keep track of the longest palindromic suffix we find in the input string.

3. Next, we use a `while` loop to repeatedly find the longest palindromic suffix of the input string. We start by finding the length of the longest palindrome that begins at the end of the string using the `is_palindrome` function. We then slice the string to get the corresponding palindromic suffix and check if it is longer than the `max_palindrome` we found so far. If it is, we update `max_palindrome` with the new longest palindrome.

4. After finding the longest palindromic suffix, we need to construct the palindrome that begins with the input string. We reverse the prefix of the string that comes before the palindromic suffix and append it to the end of the string. We do this by using slicing notation to get the prefix of the string (`string[:len(string)-len(max_palindrome)]`) and then reversing it (`max_palindrome[::-1]`). We then concatenate this reversed prefix with the palindromic suffix (`max_palindrome`) to get the final palindrome.

5. Finally, we return the constructed palindrome as the result of the function.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2) because we use the `is_palindrome` function to find the longest palindromic suffix, which has a time complexity of O(n) for each iteration of the `while` loop. The space complexity is O(n) because we store the longest palindromic suffix in the `max_palindrome` variable.
