To check if a given string is a palindrome, you can use the is_palindrome function. This function takes a string as input and returns True if the string is a palindrome and False otherwise.

To find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string, you can use the make_palindrome function. This function takes a string as input and returns the shortest palindrome that begins with the supplied string. It works by finding the longest palindromic postfix of the supplied string and then appending the reverse of the string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.

Here are some example usages of the functions:

is_palindrome('madam') # Returns True
make_palindrome('') # Returns ''
make_palindrome('cat') # Returns 'catac'
make_palindrome('cata') # Returns 'catac'

In the make_palindrome function, the algorithm finds the longest palindromic postfix of the supplied string by iteratively checking if the string is a palindrome when cutting off the first character and appending the last character. It continues this process until it finds the longest palindromic postfix. Then, it appends the reverse of the string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix and returns the resulting string.

This algorithm ensures that the shortest palindrome that begins with the supplied string is found.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.
