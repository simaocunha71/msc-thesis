The `is_palindrome()` function takes a string as an argument and returns a boolean value indicating whether the string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

The `make_palindrome()` function takes a string as an argument and returns the shortest palindrome that begins with the supplied string. It uses the following algorithm:

1. Find the longest postfix of the supplied string that is a palindrome.
2. Append to the end of the string the reverse of the string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.

For example, if you call `make_palindrome('')`, it will return an empty string, as an empty string is already a palindrome. If you call `make_palindrome('cat')`, it will return 'catac', as 'cat' followed by the reverse of the prefix 'ca' becomes the shortest palindrome. If you call `make_palindrome('cata')`, it will also return 'catac', as the algorithm finds the palindromic suffix 'ata' and appends the reverse of the prefix 'ca' to the end of the string.

These functions can be helpful in various scenarios, such as checking if a string is a palindrome or finding the shortest palindrome that begins with a given string.

Here are some test cases to verify the functionality of the functions:

```python
def test_is_palindrome():
    assert is_palindrome('') == True
    assert is_palindrome('abba') == True
    assert is_palindrome('racecar') == True
    assert is_palindrome('hello') == False

def test_make_palindrome():
    assert make_palindrome('') == ''
    assert make_palindrome('cat') == 'catac'
    assert make_palindrome('cata') == 'catac'
    assert make_palindrome('cab') == 'cabac'
    assert make_palindrome('level') == 'level'
