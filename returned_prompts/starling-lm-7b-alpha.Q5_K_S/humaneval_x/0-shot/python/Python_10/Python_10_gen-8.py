The function is_palindrome(string: str) -> bool checks if a given string is a palindrome. It does this by comparing the string to its reverse, string[::-1]. If the two are equal, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

The function make_palindrome(string: str) -> str finds the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string. It uses the following algorithm:

1. Find the longest postfix of the supplied string that is a palindrome. This can be done by iterating through the string and checking if each substring is a palindrome. The function is_palindrome() is used to check if a substring is a palindrome.

2. Append to the end of the string the reverse of the string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix. This involves finding the index of the longest palindromic postfix and then appending the reverse of the string from the beginning of the string up to that index.

The function returns the shortest palindrome as a string.

Examples of usage:

make_palindrome('') returns an empty string.
make_palindrome('cat') returns 'catac'.
make_palindrome('cata') returns 'catac'.

This solution uses a simple algorithm to find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string. However, there are more efficient algorithms available for solving this problem, such as the Manacher's algorithm or the Rabin-Karp algorithm.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the length of the string. This is because it requires iterating through the string multiple times to find the longest palindromic postfix.

The space complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because it creates a new string that is the concatenation of the original string and its reverse.

Overall, this solution provides a simple way to find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string, but it may not be the most efficient algorithm for large strings.
