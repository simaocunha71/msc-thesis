To find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string, follow these steps:

1. Find the longest palindromic postfix of the string. This is the longest prefix of the string that is also a palindrome. This can be done by iterating backwards through the string, checking if a substring is equal to its reverse, and stopping at the first non-palindromic substring.

2. Append to the end of the string the reverse of the string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix. This is the reverse of the substring that was the longest palindromic postfix found in step 1.

3. If the string was not a palindrome, repeat steps 1 and 2 until the string is a palindrome.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm:

- For the input string 'cat', the longest palindromic postfix is 'at'. Since the string 'cat' is not a palindrome, we append the reverse of the prefix 'c' to the end of the string, resulting in 'catac'.

- For the input string 'cata', the longest palindromic postfix is 'ata'. Since the string 'cata' is not a palindrome, we append the reverse of the prefix 'c' to the end of the string, resulting in 'catac'.

- For the input string '', the longest palindromic postfix is an empty string. Since the string is already a palindrome, we don't need to make any changes.

The algorithm continues in this manner until the string is a palindrome.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the length of the string. This is because it requires two iterations through the string in the worst case.

The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1), since it only requires a constant amount of extra memory to store the longest palindromic postfix and the reversed prefix.

Overall, this algorithm provides an efficient solution to find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string.

Here's an example implementation of the algorithm in Python:

```python
def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
