To make a string a palindrome, you can follow these steps:

1. Check if the given string is already a palindrome using the `is_palindrome` function. If it is, return the string as it is.

2. If the string is not a palindrome, find the longest palindromic suffix of the string using a loop. Starting from the end of the string, compare each character with the characters before it in reverse order. If a pair of characters are the same, continue comparing the next pair until the characters are different or you reach the start of the string. Keep track of the length of the longest palindromic suffix found.

3. Once the longest palindromic suffix is found, append the reverse of the string prefix (i.e., the part of the string before the palindromic suffix) to the end of the string. To get the reverse of the prefix, you can use string slicing with a step of -1 (`string[:len(string)-start_index:-1]`). Concatenate this reversed prefix to the original string using the `+` operator.

4. Finally, return the modified string as the result.

Here's an example usage of the `make_palindrome` function:

```python
print(make_palindrome('cat'))  # Output: 'catac'
print(make_palindrome('cata'))  # Output: 'catac'
```

The `make_palindrome` function takes a string as input and returns the shortest palindrome that begins with the supplied string. It uses the `is_palindrome` function to check if the string is already a palindrome and the `make_palindrome` function to find and concatenate the palindromic suffix and reversed prefix.

In the provided examples, the function is called with the strings 'cat' and 'cata'. The expected output is 'catac' for both inputs, as these are the shortest palindromes that start with the given strings.

You can use this function to make any given string a palindrome by following the steps outlined in the solution.
