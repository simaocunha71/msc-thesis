# Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. The function `total_match` takes two lists, `lst1` and `lst2`, as input.
2. It initializes an empty list called `total_match` to store the result.
3. It uses a loop to iterate through each string in `lst1`.
4. Inside the loop, it calculates the length of each string in `lst1` using the `len()` function and stores the result in a variable called `len_str`.
5. It initializes a variable called `total_chars` to keep track of the total number of characters in all the strings in `lst1`.
6. It adds the value of `len_str` to `total_chars`.
7. After the loop ends, it compares the value of `total_chars` with the length of each string in `lst2`.
8. If the length of a string in `lst2` is less than `total_chars`, it appends the string to the `total_match` list.
9. If the lengths are the same, it appends the string from `lst1` to the `total_match` list.
10. Finally, it returns the `total_match` list.

This solution compares the total number of characters in the strings of `lst1` with the length of each string in `lst2` and appends the shorter strings to the `total_match` list. If the lengths are the same, it appends the string from `lst1` to maintain the order.

Here's an example usage of the function:

```python
print(total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'Hi']))  # Output: ['hI', 'Hi']
print(total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hi', 'hi', 'admin', 'project']))  # Output: ['hi', 'admin']
print(total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'hi', 'hi']))  # Output: ['hI', 'hi', 'hi']
print(total_match(['4'], ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']))  # Output: ['4']
```

The function returns the list that has a total number
