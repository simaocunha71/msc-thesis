To calculate the area of a triangle, we can use the following formula:

area = 0.5 * base * height

In this case, the base is equal to the length of the side (a), and the height (h) is provided as an input. We can use this information to calculate the area of the triangle:

area = 0.5 * a * h

Here's an example implementation of the TriangleArea function in Go:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func TriangleArea(a float64, h float64) float64 {
    return 0.5 * a * h
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(TriangleArea(5, 3))
}
```

When we run this program, it will output `7.5`, which is the area of the triangle with a base of 5 and a height of 3.

It's important to note that the TriangleArea function assumes that the input parameters are valid and that the provided height is not greater than the base length. If the input parameters are invalid, the function may produce incorrect or undefined results.

Additionally, the TriangleArea function does not perform any error checking or validation on the input parameters. It is assumed that the caller of the function is responsible for ensuring that the input parameters are valid.

In a real-world scenario, it would be advisable to add validation checks to ensure the validity of the input parameters before performing the calculation.

In this specific case, we are not provided with any information about the validity of the input parameters, and the function is assumed to be correct based on the provided information.

The area of a triangle is calculated by multiplying the base (in this case, the length of the side) by half the height (h) and then returning the result. This is a standard mathematical formula used to calculate the area of a triangle.

In the given code example, the TriangleArea function takes two parameters: `a` and `h`, which represent the length of the side and the height of the triangle, respectively. The function then calculates the area using the formula mentioned earlier and returns the result.

The main function in the code example demonstrates how to use the TriangleArea function by passing the values 5 and 3
