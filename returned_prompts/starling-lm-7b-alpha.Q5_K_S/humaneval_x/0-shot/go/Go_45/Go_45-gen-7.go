To calculate the area of a triangle, you can use the formula:

area = 0.5 * base * height

In this case, the base is the length of one side of the triangle and the height is the height of the triangle. So, the function TriangleArea takes the length of a side and the height of the triangle as parameters and returns the area of the triangle.

Here's an example of how you can use the TriangleArea function:

TriangleArea(5, 3)

This will calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 5 and a height of 3, and return the result as a float64.

The output of this function call will be 7.5, which is the area of the triangle.

Here's the code for the TriangleArea function:

```go
func TriangleArea(a float64, h float64) float64 {
    return 0.5 * a * h
}
```

You can use this function in your Go program to calculate the area of a triangle based on the length of a side and the height of the triangle.
