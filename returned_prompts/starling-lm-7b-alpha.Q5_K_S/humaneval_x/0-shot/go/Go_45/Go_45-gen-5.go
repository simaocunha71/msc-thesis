func TriangleArea(a float64, h float64) float64 {
    return float64(a * h) / 2
}

Explanation:

The formula to calculate the area of a triangle is base multiplied by height and divided by 2. The function TriangleArea takes two parameters, a and h, which are the length of the base and the height of the triangle respectively. It returns the calculated area of the triangle.

In the implementation, the return statement uses the multiplication operator (*) to multiply the base and height, and the division operator (/) to divide the result by 2. The type of the result is explicitly converted to float64 using the float64() function to ensure the correct data type is returned.

By calling the TriangleArea function with the side length (5) and height (3) as arguments, the result 7.5 will be returned, representing the area of the triangle.

Note that the function name should be in camelCase notation, as per Go's naming conventions.

Here's a sample usage of the function:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    area := TriangleArea(5, 3)
    fmt.Println(area) // Output: 7.5
}
```

In this example, the main function calls the TriangleArea function with the arguments 5 and 3, and stores the returned value in the variable `area`. It then prints the value of `area`, which will be 7.5.

This function can be used to calculate the area of a triangle in any Go program where you need to find the area based on the length of a side and the height of the triangle.

It's important to note that this function assumes the triangle is a right triangle, as the area calculation is based on the formula for the area of a right triangle, which is half the base multiplied by the height. If you need to calculate the area of a triangle with a different shape, a different formula would be required.

Lastly, it's worth mentioning that the implementation of this function is quite simple. It doesn't include any error handling or validation of the input parameters. In a real-world scenario, you might want to add checks to ensure the
