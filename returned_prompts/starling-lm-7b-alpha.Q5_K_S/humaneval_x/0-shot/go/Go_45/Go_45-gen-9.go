To calculate the area of a triangle you can use the formula:

TriangleArea = 0.5 * base * height

Here is how you can implement this in Go:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func TriangleArea(a float64, h float64) float64 {
    return 0.5 * a * h
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(TriangleArea(5, 3))
}
```

This will output `7.5`, which is the area of a triangle with side length `5` and height `3`.

The `TriangleArea` function takes two arguments `a` and `h` that represent the side length and height of the triangle respectively. It then returns the calculated area of the triangle using the formula mentioned above.

In the `main` function, we call the `TriangleArea` function with the values `5` and `3` and print the result using `fmt.Println`.

By running this program, you will get the area of a triangle with side length `5` and height `3` as `7.5`.

Here is the Go code to calculate the area of a triangle:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func TriangleArea(a float64, h float64) float64 {
    return 0.5 * a * h
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(TriangleArea(5, 3))
}
```

The output of this program will be `7.5`, which is the area of a triangle with side length `5` and height `3`.

The `TriangleArea` function takes two arguments `a` and `h` that represent the side length and height of the triangle respectively. It then returns the calculated area of the triangle using the formula `0.5 * a * h`.

In the `main` function, we call the `TriangleArea` function with the values `5` and `3` and print the result using `fmt.Println`.
