func TriangleArea(a float64, h float64) float64 {
    return (a * h) / 2
}

Explanation:

To calculate the area of a triangle, you can use the formula:

Area = (base * height) / 2

The function TriangleArea takes two parameters, a and h, representing the length of the base and the height of the triangle, respectively. It returns the calculated area of the triangle by multiplying the base and height, and then dividing the result by 2.

In the given code example, the function TriangleArea is implemented in Go programming language. It takes two parameters, a float64 representing the length of a side, and h float64 representing the height. The function returns the calculated area of the triangle as a float64 value.

To use the function, you can call it with the desired values for the base and height, like in the example TriangleArea(5, 3). This will calculate the area of the triangle with a base length of 5 and a height of 3, and return the result 7.5 as the output.

Overall, the function TriangleArea provides a simple and efficient way to calculate the area of a triangle given the length of a side and the height.

Here's an example of how you can use the function in Go:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    area := TriangleArea(5, 3)
    fmt.Println(area)
}
```

This code will output:
7.5

It demonstrates how to call the TriangleArea function with the desired values for the base and height, and then print the calculated area to the console.

I hope this explanation helps you understand how to use the TriangleArea function and calculate the area of a triangle in Go programming language. Let me know if you have any more questions!
