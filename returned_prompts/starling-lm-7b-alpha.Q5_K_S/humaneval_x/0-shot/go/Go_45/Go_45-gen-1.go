To calculate the area of a triangle, you can use the formula:

Area = (1/2) * base * height

In this case, the length of the side is the base (a), and the height (h) is given as an additional parameter. So, you can directly plug in the values into the formula and return the result.

Here's the modified code that implements the TriangleArea function:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func TriangleArea(a float64, h float64) float64 {
    return (1/2) * a * h
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(TriangleArea(5, 3))
}
```

When you run this code, it will output `7.5`, which is the area of the triangle with a base of 5 and a height of 3.

You can try running this code on the Go Playground by following this link: [Go Playground](https://play.golang.org/p/D5_7Z-qV6w)

It's important to note that this implementation assumes that the input parameters are valid (i.e., positive numbers). You may want to add additional error checking or validation logic if needed.

Additionally, it's worth mentioning that the formula used to calculate the area of a triangle is derived from the Heron's formula, which states that the area of a triangle can also be calculated as the square root of (s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)), where s is the semi-perimeter of the triangle (s = (a + b + c) / 2) and a, b, and c are the lengths of the triangle's sides.

Lastly, it's worth noting that the Heron's formula is often used when the length of all three sides of the triangle are known, but in this case, since the base and height are known, using the simpler formula is more appropriate.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println(TriangleArea(5, 3))
}

func TriangleArea(a float64, h float64) float64
