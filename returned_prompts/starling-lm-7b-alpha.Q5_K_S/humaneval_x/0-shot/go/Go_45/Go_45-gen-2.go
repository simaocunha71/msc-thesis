To calculate the area of a triangle, you can use the formula:

    Area = (base * height) / 2

In this case, the base is the length of the side of the triangle, and the height is the height of the triangle. Here's how you can write the function to calculate the area of a triangle:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func TriangleArea(a float64, h float64) float64 {
    return (a * h) / 2
}
```

To test the function, you can call it with the length of the side and the height of the triangle as arguments:

```go
fmt.Println(TriangleArea(5, 3))
```

The output of this code will be:

```
7.5
```

This means that the area of a triangle with a side length of 5 and a height of 3 is 7.5 square units.

```

```

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func TriangleArea(a float64, h float64) float64 {
    return (a * h) / 2
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(TriangleArea(5, 3))
}
```

When you run this program, it will print the result of the function call, which is the area of the triangle with a side length of 5 and a height of 3, which is 7.5.
