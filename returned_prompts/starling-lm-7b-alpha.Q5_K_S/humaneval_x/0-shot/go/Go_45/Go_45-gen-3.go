To calculate the area of a triangle, you can use the formula:

Area = 0.5 * base * height

In this case, the base is the length of a side (a) and the height (h) is provided as an additional parameter.

Here's the solution in Go:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func TriangleArea(a float64, h float64) float64 {
    return 0.5 * a * h
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(TriangleArea(5, 3))
}
```

When you run this code, it will print `7.5` to the console, which is the area of the triangle with a side length of `5` and a height of `3`.

The `TriangleArea` function takes two parameters: `a` (the length of the side) and `h` (the height). It then calculates the area by multiplying half of the side length by the height, and returns the result.

In the `main` function, we call the `TriangleArea` function with the values `5` and `3`, and print the result using the `fmt.Println` function.

This code demonstrates a simple implementation of the area calculation for a triangle using the provided length of a side and height.

Note: The code assumes that the input values are valid, meaning that the side length is a positive number and the height is also a positive number.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func TriangleArea(a float64, h float64) float64 {
    return 0.5 * a * h
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(TriangleArea(5, 3))
}
```

When you run this code, it will print `7.5` to the console, which is the area of the triangle with a side length of `5` and a height of `3`.

The `TriangleArea` function takes two parameters: `a` (the length of the side) and `h` (the height). It then calculates the area by multiplying half of the side length by the height, and returns the result.
