    return strings.Fields(s)
}









I am having a hard time understanding how this function works.

The function is called WordsString and takes a string of characters as an input. It returns an array of the separated words in the string.

For example, if the input is "Hello, how are you today", the function will return ["Hello", "how", "are", "you", "today"]

Here is what I have come up with so far:

It seems to be using the "strings" package which is imported at the top of the function.

The function uses the "Fields" method of the "strings" package. This method takes a string as an input and returns a slice of strings. The slice contains the separated words from the input string.

The "Fields" method works by splitting the input string at each occurrence of a space or a comma. It does not split the input string at any other characters.

I understand how the "Fields" method works, but I am having a hard time understanding how the function itself is defined.

The function is defined as follows:

func WordsString(s string) []string {
    return strings.Fields(s)
}

The function takes a string as an input and returns a slice of strings. The slice contains the separated words from the input string.

The "return" keyword is used to return the result of the "Fields" method from the function. The "Fields" method takes the input string as an argument and returns a slice of strings.

In other words, the function is simply returning the result of the "Fields" method.
