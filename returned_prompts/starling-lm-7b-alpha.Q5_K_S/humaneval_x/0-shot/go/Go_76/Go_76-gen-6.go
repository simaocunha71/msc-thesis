To check if a number x is a simple power of n, you can follow these steps:

1. Start by taking the base-2 logarithm of x, denoted as log2(x). This will give you a decimal value that represents the number of times you need to divide x by 2 to get 1. For example, log2(8) = 3.0 because 2 raised to the power of 3 (2^3 = 8).

2. Round the logarithm result to the nearest integer. In the previous example, rounding 3.0 to the nearest integer gives you 3. This is necessary because the logarithm function may not always result in an exact integer value. For example, log2(15) â‰ˆ 3.97, so it gets rounded down to 3.

3. Check if the result of rounding is a multiple of the logarithm base n of 2 (log2(n)). If it is, then x is a simple power of n. Otherwise, it is not. This step is important because if the result of rounding is not a multiple of the logarithm base n of 2, it means that the number x is not a simple power of n. For example, if log2(x) = 3.0 and log2(n) = 0.5, then 3.0 is not a multiple of 0.5, so x is not a simple power of n.

4. If the result of rounding is a multiple of the logarithm base n of 2, return true. Otherwise, return false. This step is the final check to determine if x is a simple power of n. If the conditions in step 3 are met, it means that x is indeed a simple power of n. If not, then it is not.

Here's a sample implementation of the IsSimplePower function in Python:

```python
import math

def IsSimplePower(x, n):
    if x == 1:
        return True
    log_x = math.log2(x)
    rounded_log_x = round(log_x)
    if rounded_log_x % math.log2(n) == 0:
        return True
    return False
```

In this implementation, the
