Explanation:

The function IsSimplePower takes two integers x and n as input and returns a boolean value. The function aims to determine whether x is a simple power of n.

To determine if x is a simple power of n, the function uses the math package in Go to calculate the power of n raised to the power of the ceiling value of x divided by n. The math.Ceil function is used to round up the result of x divided by n to the nearest integer value. The math.Pow function is used to calculate the power of n raised to the calculated ceiling value.

The function then compares the calculated result with x using the equality operator (==) to determine if x is a simple power of n. If the result is equal to x, the function returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

For example, if we call the function with the arguments (1, 4), it will calculate 4^1 = 4, which is equal to the input value of 1. Therefore, the function will return true, indicating that 1 is a simple power of 4.

However, if we call the function with the arguments (3, 2), it will calculate 2^ceil(3/2) = 2^2 = 4, which is not equal to the input value of 3. Therefore, the function will return false, indicating that 3 is not a simple power of 2.

In summary, the function IsSimplePower checks if a number x is a simple power of another number n by calculating the power of n raised to the ceiling value of x divided by n and comparing it with x. It returns true if x is a simple power of n and false otherwise.

package main

import "math"

func main() {
    x := 1
    n := 4
    fmt.Println(IsSimplePower(x, n)) // true
    x = 2
    n = 2
    fmt.Println(Is
