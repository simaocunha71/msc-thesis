func IsSimplePower(x, n int) bool {
    for i := 0; i < 32; i++ {
        if (n << i) == x {
            return true
        }
    }
    return false
}
```

Explanation:

To determine if x is a simple power of n, we can use a loop to shift the value of n left by a certain number of bits and check if the result is equal to x. If it is, then x is a simple power of n.

In the provided solution, the loop iterates 32 times, as the maximum value of an int is 2^31 - 1. For each iteration, the value of n is shifted left by i bits using the << operator, and the result is compared to x using the == operator. If the two values are equal, the function returns true, indicating that x is a simple power of n. If the loop completes without finding a match, the function returns false, indicating that x is not a simple power of n.

For example, when calling IsSimplePower(1, 4), the loop will shift the value of n (4) left by 0 bits (i = 0) to get 4, which is equal to x (1). Therefore, the function will return true.

On the other hand, when calling IsSimplePower(3, 2), the loop will not find a match between x (3) and the shifted value of n (2 << i), and will return false.

Overall, this solution provides a straightforward approach to determining if a number is a simple power of another number, with a time complexity of O(n).

Here is a brief explanation of the code:

- The function IsSimplePower takes two integer parameters, x and n.
- Inside the function, a for loop is used to iterate 32 times, as the maximum value of an int is 2^31 - 1.
- In each iteration, the value of n is shifted left by i bits using the << operator, and the result is compared to x using the == operator.
- If the two values are equal, the function returns true, indicating that x is a simple power of n.
- If the loop completes without finding a match, the function returns false, indicating
