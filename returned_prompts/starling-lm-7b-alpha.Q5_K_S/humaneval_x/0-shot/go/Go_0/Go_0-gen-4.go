            if math.Abs(numbers[i]-numbers[j]) < threshold {

I'm new to Golang and I'm trying to write a function to check if any two numbers in a given list are closer to each other than a certain threshold. However, my function seems to be returning false even if the elements are closer to each other than the threshold.

Here's a sample code to demonstrate the problem:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "math"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println(HasCloseElements([]float64{1.0, 2.0, 3.0}, 0.5)) // false
    fmt.Println(HasCloseElements([]float64{1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0}, 0.3)) // true
}

func HasCloseElements(numbers []float64, threshold float64) bool {
    for i := 0; i < len(numbers)-1; i++ {
        for j := i + 1; j < len(numbers); j++ {
            if math.Abs(numbers[i]-numbers[j]) < threshold {
                return true
            }
        }
    }
    return false
}
```

The output should be `true` for the second test case, but it's `false`. It seems like the function is not correctly comparing the elements in the list.

Can someone help me understand what's wrong with my function and how to fix it?

The problem with your function is that it only checks the adjacent elements in the list, but it should check all possible pairs of elements. To fix this, you can use nested loops to compare all pairs of elements in the list.
