I have a function that checks if any two numbers are closer to each other than a given threshold. However, it is not working as intended.

The function is called HasCloseElements and it takes in a list of numbers and a threshold. It then iterates through the list and compares each pair of numbers to see if they are closer to each other than the threshold. If it finds any such pair, it returns true. If it does not find any such pair, it returns false.

The function is currently not working as intended because it is not correctly calculating the absolute difference between each pair of numbers. Instead of using the absolute difference formula |a-b|, it is using the relative difference formula a/b. This means that if a and b are both positive, the function will always return true, regardless of the actual distance between the numbers.

To fix the function, you need to replace the line math.Abs(numbers[i]-numbers[j]) with math.Abs(numbers[i]-numbers[j]). This will correctly calculate the absolute difference between each pair of numbers, and ensure that the function works as intended.

Here is the corrected code:

```go
import (
    "math"
)

// Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.
// >>> HasCloseElements([]float64{1.0, 2.0, 3.0}, 0.5)
// false
// >>> HasCloseElements([]float64{1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0}, 0.3)
// true
func HasCloseElements(numbers []float64, threshold float64) bool {
    for i := 0; i < len(numbers); i++ {
        for j := i + 1; j < len(numbers); j++ {
