    for i := 0; i < len(numbers); i++ {
        for j := i + 1; j < len(numbers); j++ {
            if math.Abs(numbers[i]-numbers[j]) < threshold {
                return true
            }
        }
    }
    return false
}



I'm trying to solve this problem in Go, and I'm having trouble with the logic. The problem asks to write a function that takes a list of numbers and a threshold as input, and checks if there are any two numbers in the list that are closer to each other than the specified threshold. It should return true if such a pair is found, and false otherwise.

Here's the code I wrote to solve the problem:

```go
package main

import (
    "math"
)

// Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than given threshold.
// >>> HasCloseElements([]float64{1.0, 2.0, 3.0}, 0.5)
// false
// >>> HasCloseElements([]float64{1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0}, 0.3)
// true
func HasCloseElements(numbers []float64, threshold float64) bool {

    for i := 0; i < len(numbers); i++ {
        for j := i + 1; j < len(numbers); j++ {
            if math.Abs(numbers[i]-numbers[j]) < threshold {
                return true
            }
        }
    }
    return false
}
```

In this code, I'm iterating over all pairs of numbers in the input list using two nested loops. For each pair, I calculate the absolute difference between the two numbers and check if it's less than the threshold. If it is, I immediately return true to indicate that such a pair exists. If I reach the end of the loops without finding any such pair, I return false to indicate that no such pair exists.

I'm not sure if my logic is correct or if there's a better way to solve this
