func TriplesSumToZero(l []int) bool {

Here we can see that this function uses a map to store the distinct integers from the array. This allows us to quickly check if a number is already in the array, which is necessary to ensure that we don't count the same number twice.
The function then goes through each element in the array, and for each element it checks if there is another element that, when added to the current element, gives us zero. It also checks if the current element is not equal to the other element and not equal to the third element. This ensures that we don't count the same number twice or three times.
Finally, if a triple that sums to zero is found, the function returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.


The time complexity of this function is O(n^3), where n is the length of the array. This is because for each element in the array, we are iterating through the entire array again to find a pair that, when added to the current element, gives us zero.
The space complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the array. This is because we are using a map to store the distinct integers from the array, and the size of the map is determined by the size of the array.
