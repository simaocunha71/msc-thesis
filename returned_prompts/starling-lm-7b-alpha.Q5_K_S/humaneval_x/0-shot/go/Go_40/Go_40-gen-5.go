Explanation:

To solve this problem, we use a map to store the count of every element in the list. Then, for every element in the list, we check if the element's count is greater than 2, which means we can use this element twice. Otherwise, we check if the complement of this element (the element minus the current element) exists in the map. If it does, we reduce the count of the complement by 1, and if the count is still greater than 1, we continue to reduce the count until it reaches 1. If the count is 1, we found three distinct elements that sum to zero, and we return true. Otherwise, we continue to the next element in the list.

As a result, if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, the function returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the list.

The space complexity of this solution is O(n), as we use a map to store the count of every element in the list.
