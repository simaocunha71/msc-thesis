```go
var res bool
m := map[int]int{}
for _, v := range l {
    for _, v2 := range l {
        if v + v2 + m[v+v2] == 0 {
            res = true
        } else {
            m[v+v2] += 1
        }
    }
}
return res
```

Here's a possible solution for the TriplesSumToZero problem:

The solution uses a map `m` to keep track of the occurrence of the sum of each pair of elements. It iterates through the input list `l` and for each element, it iterates through the list again. If the sum of the two elements is equal to zero, it sets the result to true. Otherwise, it increments the count of the sum in the map `m`.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) and a space complexity of O(n).

```go
func TriplesSumToZero(l []int) bool {
    m := map[int]int{}
    for _, v := range l {
        for _, v2 := range l {
            if v + v2 + m[v+v2] == 0 {
                return true
            } else {
                m[v+v2] += 1
            }
        }
    }
    return false
}
```

This function takes a list of integers `l` as an input and returns a boolean value indicating whether there exist three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero. It uses a map `m` to keep track of the occurrence of the sum of each pair of elements. It iterates through the input list `l` and for each element, it iterates through the list again. If the sum of the two elements is equal to zero, it sets the result to true. Otherwise, it increments the count of the sum in the map `m`. If no such triplet is found, it returns false.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) because it iterates through the input list twice for each pair of elements. The space complexity is O(n) because it uses a map to store the counts of each sum.

Here are some test cases to verify
