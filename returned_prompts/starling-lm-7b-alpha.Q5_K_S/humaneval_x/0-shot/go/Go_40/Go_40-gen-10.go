To solve this problem, we need to check all the possible combinations of three elements from the input list. Then, we need to check if the sum of these three elements is equal to zero. To optimize the performance, we should sort the list before performing the combinations. This is because, in a sorted list, all the combinations that have the same sum are grouped together.

Here is a sample solution in Go:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sort"
)

func TriplesSumToZero(l []int) bool {
    sort.Ints(l)
    n := len(l)
    for i := 0; i < n-2; i++ {
        for j := i + 1; j < n-1; j++ {
            for k := j + 1; k < n; k++ {
                if l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0 {
                    return true
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return false
}
```

In this solution, we first sort the list using the `sort.Ints` function. Then, we iterate through the list and check all the combinations of three elements. If the sum of these three elements is equal to zero, we return true. If we have checked all the combinations and no sum is equal to zero, we return false.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^3), where n is the length of the input list. However, since we are checking all the combinations of three elements, this is the best we can do.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.
