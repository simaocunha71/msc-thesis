This code is for calculating the mean absolute deviation. However, it does not correctly calculate the mean absolute deviation, as it does not correctly calculate the mean of the numbers.

The mean is correctly calculated with the function "mean(numbers)". However, the function "MeanAbsoluteDeviation(numbers []float64) float64" does not correctly calculate the mean absolute deviation, as it does not correctly calculate the mean of the numbers.

To correctly calculate the mean absolute deviation, you need to use the formula:

MAD = (1 / N) * Σ | x - x̄ |

where N is the number of elements in the dataset and x̄ is the mean of the dataset. The function "MeanAbsoluteDeviation(numbers []float64) float64" should be modified as follows:

func MeanAbsoluteDeviation(numbers []float64) float64 {
    mean := mean(numbers)
    sum := 0.0
    for _, n := range numbers {
        sum += math.Abs(n - mean)
    }
    return sum / float64(len(numbers))
}

This will correctly calculate the mean absolute deviation of the dataset.

Here is the corrected code:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "math"
)

func main() {
    numbers := []float64{1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0}
    fmt.Println(MeanAbsoluteDeviation(numbers))
}

func mean(numbers []float64) float64 {
    sum := 0.0
    for _, n := range numbers {
        sum += n
