This is the solution to the MeanAbsoluteDeviation kata on Exercism.
Here's the original problem:

For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation around the mean of this dataset. Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):

MAD = average | x - x_mean |

For example, given the list of numbers [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0], the mean is 2.5, and the mean absolute deviation is 1.0.

To solve this kata you need to:

Define a function mean_absolute_deviation that takes a list of numbers as its input. It should return a single float value, the mean absolute deviation.

Note: You may assume the list will always contain at least one number.

Here are some tests to help you get started:

```go
fmt.Println(mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])) // 1.0
fmt.Println(mean_absolute_deviation([1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5])) // 1.0
fmt.Println(mean_absolute_deviation([-2.0, -1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 2.0])) // 1.0
```







Answer:
The MeanAbsoluteDeviation function takes a slice of float64 and calculates the average absolute difference between each element and the mean of the slice. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the function:

1. It initializes a variable called mean to 0.0 and a variable called sum to 0.0.
