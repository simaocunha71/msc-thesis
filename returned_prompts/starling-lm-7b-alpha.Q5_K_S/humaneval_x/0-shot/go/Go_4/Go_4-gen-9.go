This code defines a function named MeanAbsoluteDeviation that takes a slice of float64 and returns a single float64 value. The function first initializes a variable named sum to 0.0. Then it gets the length of the input slice and initializes a variable named n to that length. After that, it initializes a variable named mean to 0.0.

The function then iterates over each element in the input slice using a for loop. Inside the loop, it adds the absolute difference between the current element and the mean (which is calculated by adding the current element to mean) to the sum variable. It also adds the current element to the mean variable.

After the loop, the mean is divided by the length of the input slice to get the average value. The sum is then divided by the length of the input slice to get the average absolute deviation from the mean.

Finally, the function returns the calculated mean absolute deviation.

This function can be used to calculate the mean absolute deviation of a given dataset by passing a slice of float64 values to the function.

For example, if we call MeanAbsoluteDeviation with the input [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0], the function will return 1.0, as the mean absolute deviation of this dataset is 1.0.
