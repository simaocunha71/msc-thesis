    var count int
    for _, r := range str {
        count += 1 << (strings.Index(str, string(r)) >> 1)
    }
    return count
}

I'm having trouble understanding this solution. What does the line "count += 1 << (strings.Index(str, string(r)) >> 1)" do in the code?

It's not clear to me what the << and >> operations are used for.

The << operator is a bitwise left shift. It takes two operands, the left operand is the bit pattern to be shifted and the right operand is the number of positions to shift the bit pattern left. 

For example, if we have the following bit pattern: 

0000 0001 (binary representation of 1)

And we shift it left by one position, the result is: 

0000 0010 (binary representation of 2)

This is because we are shifting the bit pattern 1 position to the left, effectively multiplying the number by 2. 

Similarly, the >> operator is a bitwise right shift. It takes two operands, the left operand is the bit pattern to be shifted and the right operand is the number of positions to shift the bit pattern right. 

For example, if we have the following bit pattern: 

0000 0001 (binary representation of 1)

And we shift it right by one position, the result is: 

0000 0000 (binary representation of 0)

This is because we are shifting the bit pattern 1 position to the right, effectively dividing the number by 2. 

In the given code, the line "count += 1 << (strings.Index(str, string(r)) >> 1)" is used to determine if a character is already counted. 

Here's how it works: 

1. The "strings.Index(str, string(r))" function is used to find the index of the first occurrence of the character "r" in the string "str". 

2. The index is then shifted to the right by one position using the ">> 1" operation. This is done to move the least significant bit
