    // Set to track the characters
    seen := make(map[rune]bool)

    // Iterate through the string
    for _, r := range str {
        // If the character is not in the set, add it and increment the counter
        if !seen[r] {
            seen[r] = true
        }
    }

    return len(seen)
}

In this exercise, we are given a function that takes a string as an input and counts the number of distinct characters in the string. Here are some important points to note:

- The function uses a map to track the characters it has seen so far. The map is called `seen` and is of type `map[rune]bool`. `rune` is a type that represents a Unicode scalar value, which is a single character in the Unicode character set.
- The function iterates through each character in the input string using a `range` loop. The loop variable `r` represents the current character.
- Inside the loop, the function checks if the current character `r` is not in the `seen` map. If it's not in the map, it means the character has not been seen before. In that case, the function adds the character to the map and increments the counter `len(seen)` by 1.
- Finally, the function returns the value of `len(seen)`, which represents the number of distinct characters in the string.

To use the function, you can simply call it with a string as an argument, like this:

CountDistinctCharacters("xyzXYZ") // Returns 3, as the string consists of 3 distinct characters: x, y, and z.
CountDistinctCharacters("Jerry") // Returns 4, as the string consists of 4 distinct characters: J, e, r, and y.

Overall, this function is a simple and efficient way to count the number of distinct characters in a string, taking into account the case sensitivity of the characters.

Note: The solution uses `rune` instead of `string` because `string` is not a type in Go, but a built-in identifier for the string type. Using `rune` allows us to handle each character separately, regardless of its case.

I hope this explanation helps you understand the code and
