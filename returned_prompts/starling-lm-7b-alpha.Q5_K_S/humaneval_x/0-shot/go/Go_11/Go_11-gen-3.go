    var result string
    for i := 0; i < len(a); i++ {
        if a[i] == b[i] {
            result += string(a[i])
        } else {
            result += "1"
        }
    }
    return result
}

Answer:
The provided function is incorrect and does not perform binary XOR operation.
In order to perform binary XOR operation, you should follow these steps:

1. Initialize an empty string named result.
2. Iterate through the strings a and b.
3. For each index i, if the characters at index i of a and b are equal, append "0" to the result string. Otherwise, append "1".
4. Return the result string.

Here is the corrected code:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func StringXor(a string, b string) string {
    result := ""

    for i := 0; i < len(a); i++ {
        if a[i] == b[i] {
            result += "0"
        } else {
            result += "1"
        }
    }

    return result
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(StringXor("010", "110")) // Output: "100"
}
```

You can test the function with different inputs using the `fmt.Println` statement in the `main` function.

The code above will output "100" when given the inputs "010" and "110".

This is because the XOR operation is performed on each corresponding bit of the input strings. In binary, XOR is represented as "^". So, "010" XOR "110" equals "100".

To use the `StringXor` function, simply call it with two string arguments. The function will return the XOR result as a string.

Note: Make sure that the length of the input strings is the same, otherwise, an error will occur.

It's important to note that the `StringXor` function assumes that the input strings consist only of binary digits (0s and
