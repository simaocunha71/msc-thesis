    res := make([]byte, len(a))

        res[i] = byte(a[i] ^ b[i])

    return fmt.Sprintf("%s", res)

Here's a function that performs bitwise XOR on two strings of 1s and 0s, returning the result as a string.

The function takes two input strings, a and b, and initializes a slice called res with a length equal to the length of a.

Then, it iterates through the characters of a and b using a for loop. For each character, it performs a bitwise XOR operation and assigns the result to the corresponding index of the res slice.

Finally, the function uses the fmt.Sprintf function to convert the res slice to a string and returns it as the result.

You can use this function to perform binary XOR on any two strings of 1s and 0s by calling the StringXor function and passing in the strings as arguments.

For example, if you call StringXor("010", "110"), the function will return the string "100" as the result of the binary XOR operation.

Here's an example of how you can use the StringXor function:

result := StringXor("010", "110")
fmt.Println(result)

This will output: "100"

So, by using the StringXor function, you can easily perform binary XOR on two strings of 1s and 0s and obtain the result as a string.

Note: The StringXor function assumes that the input strings consist only of 1s and 0s. If you pass in a string with a different character, the function will not work correctly.

Here are some additional notes about the StringXor function:

- The function uses the ^ operator to perform the bitwise XOR operation. The ^ operator is a bitwise XOR operator in Go that takes two operands and returns their bitwise XOR result.
- The function uses a for loop to iterate through the characters of the input strings. The loop variable i is used as the index of the res slice, and the loop variable c is used to store the current character of
