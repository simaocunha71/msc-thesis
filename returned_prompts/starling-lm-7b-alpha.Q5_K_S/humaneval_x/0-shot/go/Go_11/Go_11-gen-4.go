    var result string = ""

    for i := 0; i < len(a); i++ {
        if a[i] != b[i] {
            result += "1"
        } else {
            result += "0"
        }
    }

    return result
}

Answer:
The given code defines a function called StringXor, which takes in two strings a and b as input, both consisting only of 1s and 0s. The function performs binary XOR on these inputs and returns the result as a string.

Inside the function, a variable called "result" is declared and initialized as an empty string. Then, a for loop is used to iterate through each character of the strings a and b. For each character at index i, the code checks if the characters at the same index in both strings are different. If they are different, it means that the XOR operation will result in 1, so the code appends "1" to the "result" string. Otherwise, if the characters are the same, the XOR operation will result in 0, so the code appends "0" to the "result" string.

Finally, the function returns the "result" string, which represents the binary XOR of the input strings a and b.

To use the StringXor function, you can call it with two strings as arguments. For example, in the provided code snippet, the function is called with the strings "010" and "110". The result of the XOR operation is then printed using the fmt.Println function.

The output of the code snippet is "100", which is the binary XOR of the input strings "010" and "110".

In summary, the code defines a function that performs binary XOR on two input strings consisting of 1s and 0s, and returns the result as a string. The provided code snippet demonstrates how to use the function and prints the result of the XOR operation on the input strings "010" and "110".

Here are some additional notes on the code:
- The StringXor function takes two string arguments, named "a" and "b".
- Inside the function, a for loop is used to iterate through each character of the input
