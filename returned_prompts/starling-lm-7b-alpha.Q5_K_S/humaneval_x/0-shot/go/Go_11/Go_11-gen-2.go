Answer:
The provided code is a Go function that performs binary XOR operation on two strings consisting of 1s and 0s. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the function works:

1. The function takes two string inputs, `a` and `b`, representing binary numbers.
2. It initializes an empty string variable called `result` to store the result of the XOR operation.
3. The function iterates over the indices of the characters in the `a` string using a for loop.
4. Inside the loop, it checks the corresponding characters in `a` and `b`.
5. If the character in `a` is '1', the function checks the character in `b`. If the character in `b` is '0', it appends '1' to the `result` string; otherwise, it appends '0'.
6. If the character in `a` is '0', the function checks the character in `b`. If the character in `b` is '0', it appends '0' to the `result` string; otherwise, it appends '1'.
7. After the loop finishes, the function returns the `result` string, which represents the binary XOR of the input strings.
8. The provided example `StringXor('010', '110')` demonstrates the usage of the function, and the expected output is `'100'`.

To summarize, the function takes two binary strings as input, performs binary XOR operation on them, and returns the result as a binary string.

Here's the updated Go code for the `StringXor` function:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)
