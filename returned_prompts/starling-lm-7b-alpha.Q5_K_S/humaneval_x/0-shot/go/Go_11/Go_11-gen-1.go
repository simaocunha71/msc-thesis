    res := ""
    for i := 0; i < len(a); i++ {
        if a[i] == b[i] {
            res += "0"
        } else {
            res += "1"
        }
    }
    return res

}

Answer:
The above code defines a function `StringXor` that takes two input strings `a` and `b`, both consisting only of 1s and 0s. The function performs binary XOR on these inputs and returns the result as a string.

To perform binary XOR, the function initializes an empty string `res` to store the result. It then iterates through each character of the input strings using a `for` loop. Inside the loop, it checks if the characters at the corresponding positions in `a` and `b` are equal. If they are equal, it appends "0" to the result string; otherwise, it appends "1".

Finally, the function returns the result string `res` after performing binary XOR on the input strings.

To test the function, you can use the provided example input `StringXor('010', '110')`, which should return the string "100" as the result of the XOR operation.

You can run the code and test the function by executing it in a Go environment.

Here's a sample Go program that demonstrates the usage of the `StringXor` function:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    result := StringXor("010", "110")
    fmt.Println(result)
}
```

When you run this program, it will output:

```
100
```

This indicates that the XOR operation on the input strings "010" and "110" resulted in the string "100".

Note that the `StringXor` function assumes that the input strings `a` and `b` are of the same length. If they are not, the function may produce incorrect results. It's important to ensure that the lengths of the input strings are equal before calling the function.

Additionally, the function performs a bit-
