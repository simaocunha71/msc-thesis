In this function, first sort the input list in ascending order using sort.Ints() function. Then iterate over the sorted list, starting from the second element. If the current element is the same as the previous one, move to the next element. Otherwise, calculate the frequency of the current element by iterating over the entire list and counting the occurrences. If the frequency is greater than or equal to the current element, return the current element. Otherwise, move to the next element. If no such element is found, return -1.

This function has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting step, and a space complexity of O(n) due to the use of the sort.Ints() function and the additional frequency count variable.

Note: The function uses the sort.Ints() function from the sort package, which is part of the Go standard library. This function is used to sort the input list in ascending order.
