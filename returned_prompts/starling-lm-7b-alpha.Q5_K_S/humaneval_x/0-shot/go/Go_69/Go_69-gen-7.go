```go
m := map[int]int{}
for _, v := range lst {
    m[v]++

for i := 1; i <= len(lst); i++ {
    if m[i] >= i {
        return i
    }
}
return -1
```

Explanation:

The function `Search` takes in a non-empty list of positive integers and returns the greatest integer that is greater than zero, and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself. If no such a value exists, it returns -1.

The function first initializes an empty map `m` to store the frequency of each integer in the list. It then iterates through the list and increments the frequency of each integer in the map.

Next, the function uses a for loop to iterate from 1 to the length of the list. For each iteration, it checks if the frequency of the current integer `i` in the map is greater than or equal to `i` itself. If it is, the function returns `i`. If no such value exists, the function returns -1.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the list. This is because the function iterates through the list once to calculate the frequency of each integer, and then iterates through the list again to find the desired value. The space complexity of the solution is O(n), as the function uses a map to store the frequency of each integer in the list.

Overall, this solution provides a straightforward and efficient way to solve the problem, with a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n).

```go
m := map[int]int{}
for _, v := range lst {
    m[v]++
}
for i := 1; i <= len(lst); i++ {
    if m[i] >= i {
        return i
    }
}
return -1
```

This is a Python solution to the problem:

```python
def search(lst):
    m = {}
    for v in lst:
        m[v] = m.get(v, 0) + 1
    for i in range(1, len(
