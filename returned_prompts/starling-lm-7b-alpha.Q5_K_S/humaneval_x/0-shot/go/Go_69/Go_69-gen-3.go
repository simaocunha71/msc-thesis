```go
m := make(map[int]int)
for _, v := range lst {
    m[v]++
}

max := -1
for k, v := range m {
    if v >= k && max < v {
        max = v
    }
}

return max
```

Explanation:
The code first creates a map that stores the frequency of each element in the list. Then, it iterates through the map to find the maximum frequency that is greater than or equal to the key. If no such maximum value is found, the function returns -1.

```go
func Search(lst []int) int {
    m := make(map[int]int)
    for _, v := range lst {
        m[v]++
    }
    max := -1
    for k, v := range m {
        if v >= k && max < v {
            max = v
        }
    }
    return max
}
```

In the given code, a map `m` is created to store the frequency of each element in the list. Then, a for loop is used to iterate through the map. For each key-value pair, it checks if the value is greater than or equal to the key and if the current maximum value is less than the value. If both conditions are true, the maximum value is updated. Finally, the maximum value is returned as the result.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input list. This is because the map creation and the for loop iteration take linear time with respect to the size of the list.

The space complexity of this solution is also O(n), as the map stores the frequency of each element in the list, which can take up to n space.

Overall, this solution provides a concise and efficient way to find the greatest integer with a frequency greater than or equal to its value in a given list of positive integers.

```go
func Search(lst []int) int {
    m := make(map[int]int)
    for _, v := range lst {
        m[v]++
    }
    max := -1
    for k, v := range m {
        if v >=
