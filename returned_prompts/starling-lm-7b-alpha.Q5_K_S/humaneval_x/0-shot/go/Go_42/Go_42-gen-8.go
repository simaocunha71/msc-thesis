    for i := 0; i < len(l); i++ {
        l[i]++
    }
    return l
}

    // Increment each element in the list.
    for i := 0; i < len(l); i++ {
        l[i]++
    }

    // Return the modified list.
    return l


In this solution, the function IncrList takes a slice of integers as input and modifies each element in the slice by incrementing it by one. It then returns the modified slice.

To achieve this, the function uses a for loop to iterate over each element in the slice. Inside the loop, each element is incremented by one using the post-increment operator (++). This ensures that the original slice is modified in-place.

Finally, the modified slice is returned as the result of the function.

You can test the function by calling it with different input slices and checking the returned slices. For example, IncrList([]int{1, 2, 3}) will return []int{2, 3, 4}, and IncrList([]int{5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123}) will return []int{6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124}.

Overall, this solution demonstrates a simple and efficient way to increment each element in a slice by one and return the modified slice as the result.
