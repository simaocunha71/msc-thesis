IncrList := func(l []int) []int {
    for i := 0; i < len(l); i++ {
        l[i]++
    }
    return l
}

Here's a breakdown of the code:

- The function `IncrList` takes in a slice of integers (`l`) as an argument and returns a slice of integers.
- Inside the function, we use a `for` loop to iterate over each element in the input slice `l`.
- Within the loop, we increment each element in the slice by 1 using the `++` operator.
- After the loop, we return the modified slice `l`.
- The provided test cases demonstrate the function's behavior by passing different input slices to `IncrList` and printing the expected and actual results.

This code snippet defines a function called `IncrList` that increments each element in a given slice of integers by 1. It uses a `for` loop to iterate over the slice and increments each element using the `++` operator. Finally, it returns the modified slice.

To use this function, you can call it with a slice of integers as an argument, like `IncrList([1, 2, 3])`, and it will return a new slice with the elements incremented by 1, in this case, `[2, 3, 4]`.

Note that the function modifies the original slice in-place, meaning that the changes are applied directly to the input slice itself. If you want to keep the original slice unchanged, you can make a copy of it before passing it to the function.

Here are some additional test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    l := []int{1, 2, 3}
    fmt.Println(IncrList(l)) // Output: [2, 3, 4]

    l = []int{5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123}
    fmt.Println(IncrList(l)) // Output: [6, 4, 6, 3, 4,
