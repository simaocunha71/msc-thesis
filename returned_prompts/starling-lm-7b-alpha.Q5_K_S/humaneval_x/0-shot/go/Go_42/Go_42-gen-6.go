```go
func IncrList(l []int) []int {
	incrList := make([]int, len(l))
	for i, v := range l {
		incrList[i] = v + 1
	}
	return incrList
}
```

Explanation:

In this function, we start by creating a new slice called `incrList` with the same length as the input slice `l`. We then iterate over each element of the input slice using the `range` keyword. For each element, we increment its value by 1 and assign it to the corresponding index of `incrList`. Finally, we return the `incrList`.

By using the `range` keyword in the `for` loop, we can access both the index and value of each element in the input slice. This allows us to easily increment each value by 1 and store the result in the new slice.

The `make` function is used to create a new slice with the specified length. It allocates memory for the slice and initializes all elements to the zero value of their type (which is `0` for integers). We pass the length of `l` as an argument to `make` to ensure that the new slice has the same length as the input slice.

Overall, this implementation of `IncrList` creates a new slice with the same length as the input slice and increments each element by 1, returning the resulting slice as the output.
