    var maxLength int = 0
    var maxWord string = ""
    for _, word := range words {
        uniqueChars := make(map[rune]bool)
        for _, c := range word {
            uniqueChars[c] = true
        }
        if len(uniqueChars) > maxLength {
            maxLength = len(uniqueChars)
            maxWord = word
        } else if len(uniqueChars) == maxLength && word < maxWord {
            maxWord = word
        }
    }
    return maxWord
}

In the above code, I'm trying to create a function which accepts a slice of strings and returns the string with maximum number of unique characters. The slice may contain duplicate strings.

As a part of the solution, I'm trying to count the unique characters in each string. For this, I'm creating a map of rune to bool and populating the map with the characters of the string. 

However, I'm not sure if my current approach to count unique characters is correct. I'm thinking of using the map's built-in `len` function to get the number of unique characters. 

Also, I'm not sure if the `uniqueChars` map should be declared outside the `for` loop.

In addition, I'm not sure if the current logic of comparing the `maxLength` variable and the length of `uniqueChars` is correct. 

Lastly, I'm not sure if the logic to select the word with maximum number of unique characters in lexicographical order is correct.

I would appreciate any feedback regarding the correctness of my current approach as well as any suggestions to improve it.



Answer

The current approach is correct in terms of counting unique characters and sorting them in lexicographical order. However, there are a few improvements that can be made to the code. 

Firstly, it is recommended to use a `map[rune]struct{}` instead of a `map[rune]bool` to count unique characters. This is because a `map[rune]struct{}` is more memory-efficient than a `map[rune]bool`. 

Secondly, instead of creating a separate variable to store the maximum length of unique characters
