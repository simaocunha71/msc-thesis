```go
planets := []string{"Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus", "Neptune"}

var result []string

if !contains(planets, planet1) || !contains(planets, planet2) {
    return result
}

for i := 0; i < len(planets); i++ {
    if planets[i] == planet1 {
        break
    }
}

for j := i; j < len(planets); j++ {
    if planets[j] == planet2 {
        break
    }
    result = append(result, planets[j])
}

return result
```

Explanation:
The function first checks if the planet1 or planet2 is not present in the planets list. If any of them is not present, it returns an empty tuple.

Then, it goes through the planets list and finds the index of planet1. Once it finds the index, it starts appending the planets from the index to planet2 to the result slice. Finally, it returns the result slice which contains all the planets between planet1 and planet2, in the order of their proximity to the Sun.

Time complexity: O(n)

Space complexity: O(n)

Here is a detailed step-by-step explanation:

1. The function first checks if either planet1 or planet2 is not present in the planets list. If any of them is not present, it returns an empty tuple (i.e., an empty slice).

2. It then goes through the planets list and finds the index of planet1. It uses the variable i to keep track of the index. Once it finds the index, it starts appending the planets from the index to planet2 to the result slice. It uses the variable j to keep track of the index while appending the planets.

3. After appending all the planets, the function returns the result slice, which contains all the planets between planet1 and planet2, in the order of their proximity to the Sun.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) because it goes through the planets list once and the space complexity is also O(n) because it creates a result slice of size n
