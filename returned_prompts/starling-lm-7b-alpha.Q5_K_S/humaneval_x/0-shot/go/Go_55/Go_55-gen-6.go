If `n` is 0 or 1, return `n`. Otherwise, return the sum of the two previous Fibonacci numbers.

```go
func Fib(n int) int {
    if n == 0 || n == 1 {
        return n
    }
    return Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2)
}
```

The Go programming language does not have tail call optimization, which means that the above code will cause a stack overflow for large values of `n`. Here are alternative implementations that are tail-recursive and do not overflow:

```go
func Fib(n int) int {
    fibs := make([]int, n+1)
    fibs[0] = 0
    fibs[1] = 1
    for i := 2; i <= n; i++ {
        fibs[i] = fibs[i-1] + fibs[i-2]
    }
    return fibs[n]
}
```

The above implementation creates an array to store all the Fibonacci numbers up to the `n`th number.

```go
func Fib(n int) int {
    a, b := 0, 1
    for n > 0 {
        a, b = b, a+b
        n--
    }
    return a
}
```

This implementation is tail recursive, but since Go does not have tail call optimization, it still has an exponential time complexity.

```go
func Fib(n int) int {
    a, b := 0, 1
    for n > 0 {
        a, b = b, a+b
        n--
    }
    return a
}
```

This implementation is tail recursive, but since Go does not have tail call optimization, it still has an exponential time complexity.

```go
func Fib(n int) int {
    if n == 0 || n == 1 {
        return n
    }
    return Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2)
}
```

The above code does not cause a stack overflow
