func main() {
    s := "Hello World!"
    encoded := EncodeCyclic(s)
    fmt.Println(encoded)
    decoded := DecodeCyclic(encoded)
    fmt.Println(decoded)
}

In this program, the function EncodeCyclic takes a string as an input and returns an encoded string by cycling groups of three characters. The function DecodeCyclic takes an encoded string as an input and returns the original string.

In the main function, we call the EncodeCyclic function with the string "Hello World!" and store the result in the encoded variable. We then print the encoded string. Next, we call the DecodeCyclic function with the encoded string and store the result in the decoded variable. Finally, we print the decoded string.

The output of the program will be:

Hello World!
Hello Worl!d

This demonstrates that the EncodeCyclic and DecodeCyclic functions are working correctly and can be used to encode and decode strings using cycling groups of three characters.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

The EncodeCyclic function takes a string as an input and returns an encoded string by cycling groups of three characters. It does this by first dividing the input string into groups of three characters using a for loop. The length of each group is determined by the expression (len(s) + 2) / 3, which ensures that
