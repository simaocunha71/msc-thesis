To encode a string using the EncodeCyclic function, you can follow these steps:

1. Define the function EncodeCyclic(s string) string that takes a string as input and returns the encoded string.
2. Create an empty slice called groups to store the substrings of the input string, each consisting of three characters.
3. Use a for loop to iterate over the input string and extract substrings of three characters. Append each substring to the groups slice.
4. Create an empty slice called newGroups to store the modified substrings.
5. Use a for loop to iterate over the groups slice. For each substring, check if it has exactly three characters. If it does, modify it by moving the first character to the end and concatenating the resulting substring to the newGroups slice. If it has less than three characters, concatenate the substring as is to the newGroups slice.
6. Use the strings.Join() function to concatenate the substrings in the newGroups slice, separating them with an empty string, and assign the result to the s variable.
7. Return the s variable, which now contains the encoded string.

To decode a string encoded with the EncodeCyclic function, you can follow these steps:

1. Define the function DecodeCyclic(s string) string that takes a string as input and returns the decoded string.
2. Use a for loop to iterate over the input string, cycling groups of three characters. Extract each group using the s[3*i:int(math.Min(float64(3*i+3), float64(len(s))))] syntax and append it to the groups slice.
3. Create an empty slice called newGroups to store the modified substrings.
4. Use a for loop to iterate over the groups slice. For each substring, check if it has exactly three characters. If it does, modify it by moving the first character to the end and concatenating the resulting substring to the newGroups slice. If it has less than three characters, concatenate the substring as is to the newGroups slice.
5. Use the strings.Join() function to concatenate the substrings in the newGroups slice, separating them with an empty string, and assign the result to the s variable.
