The EncodeCyclic function takes a string and returns an encoded string by cycling groups of three characters. The DecodeCyclic function takes a string encoded with the EncodeCyclic function and returns the original string.

Here is how the EncodeCyclic function works:

1. It takes a string as an input.
2. It initializes a slice called groups to store substrings of the input string of length three.
3. It iterates over the input string and appends substrings of length three to the groups slice.
4. It initializes a new slice called newGroups.
5. It iterates over the groups slice and checks if a group has a length of three.
6. If a group has a length of three, it creates a new string by moving the second character to the front and appends it to the newGroups slice.
7. If a group does not have a length of three, it appends the group as is to the newGroups slice.
8. Finally, it joins all the elements of the newGroups slice with an empty string and returns the result.

Here is how the DecodeCyclic function works:

1. It takes a string as an input, which is encoded with the EncodeCyclic function.
2. It initializes a slice called groups to store substrings of the input string of length three.
3. It iterates over the input string and appends substrings of length three to the groups slice.
4. It initializes a new slice called newGroups.
5. It iterates over the groups slice and checks if a group has a length of three.
6. If a group has a length of three, it creates a new string by moving the third character to the front and appends it to the newGroups slice.
7. If a group does not have a length of three, it appends the group as is to the newGroups slice.
8. Finally, it joins all the elements of the newGroups slice with an empty string and returns the result, which is the original string.

You can use the provided EncodeCyclic and DecodeCyclic functions to encode and decode strings using the cycling groups of three characters technique.

Here is an example usage of the EncodeCyclic and DecodeCyclic functions:

package main
