The EncodeCyclic function takes a string as input and returns an encoded string by cycling groups of three characters. The function first creates a slice of strings called "groups" and iterates through the input string, appending each group of three characters to the slice. If the length of the group is less than three, it is appended as is.

After all the groups have been created, a new slice of strings called "newGroups" is created. The function then iterates through the "groups" slice and checks the length of each group. If the length is exactly three, the group is cycled by appending the second character to the front, and the result is added to the "newGroups" slice. Otherwise, the group is added as is.

Finally, the "newGroups" slice is joined into a single string using the strings.Join function and returned as the decoded string.

The DecodeCyclic function takes a string as input, which is assumed to be encoded using the EncodeCyclic function. It then iterates through the input string, splitting it into groups of three characters. If the length of the group is less than three, it is appended as is. The function then joins the groups back together into a single string and returns the decoded string.

In summary, the EncodeCyclic function encodes a string by cycling groups of three characters, and the DecodeCyclic function decodes a string that was previously encoded using the EncodeCyclic function.

Here's an example of how to use these functions:

package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    encoded := EncodeCyclic("abcdefghij")
    fmt.Println(encoded) // Output: adefhbcij
    decoded := DecodeCyclic(encoded)
    fmt.Println(decoded) // Output: abcdefghij
}

This example demonstrates how to encode and decode a string using the provided functions. The input string "abcdefghij" is encoded using the EncodeCyclic function, resulting in the string "adefhbcij". The DecodeCyclic function is then used to decode the encoded string, producing the original input string "abcdefghij".

Note that in this example, the input
