// This is the solution to the problem of the cyclic encoding of a string.

func main() {
    fmt.Println(EncodeCyclic("Hello World!"))
    fmt.Println(DecodeCyclic("HeoWlooWlrd!"))
}

ANSWER:
The EncodeCyclic function cycles groups of three characters in a string, while the DecodeCyclic function does the reverse. Here is the code for these functions:

To encode a string, the EncodeCyclic function creates a slice called "groups" to store the groups of three characters from the input string. It then iterates over the string, creating a new group every three characters and appending it to the "groups" slice. If a group is not a multiple of three, it is left unchanged. Finally, the function creates another slice called "newGroups" and iterates over the "groups" slice. For each group, it converts the group to a slice of runes, checks if the length of the group is three, and if so, it creates a new string by appending the second and third runes to the front of the slice and adding the first rune to the end. This new string is then appended to the "newGroups" slice. If the length of the group is not three, the original group is appended to the "newGroups" slice. The function returns the string created by joining all the elements of the "newGroups" slice with an empty string.
