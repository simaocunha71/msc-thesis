Longest([]string{})
B:
Longest([]string{"a", "b", "c"})
C:
Longest([]string{"a", "bb", "ccc"})

Explanation:

The function Longest takes a list of strings as an argument and returns the longest string from the list. If multiple strings have the same length, it returns the first one encountered. If the input list is empty, it returns nil. 

In solution A, the function is called with an empty list of strings, which means there are no strings to compare. As a result, it returns nil.

In solution B, the function is called with a list of strings that contains 'a', 'b', and 'c'. Since 'c' is the longest string in the list, it is returned as the result.

In solution C, the function is called with a list of strings that contains 'a', 'bb', and 'ccc'. Since 'ccc' is the longest string in the list, it is returned as the result.

Note: The code provided is in Go, but the concept of finding the longest string from a list of strings can be applied in any programming language.

Additionally, if you prefer to return an error instead of nil when there are no strings provided, you can modify the function as follows:

```go
func Longest(strings []string) (string, error) {
    if len(strings) == 0 {
        return "", errors.New("no strings provided")
    }
    longest := strings[0]
    for _, s := range strings {
        if len(s) > len(longest) {
            longest = s
        }
    }
    return longest, nil
}
```

In this modified version, if the input list is empty, it returns an empty string and an error message indicating that no strings were provided. Otherwise, it finds the longest string in the same way as the previous implementation, but now it returns an error if there are no strings in the input list.

This allows you to handle the case where no strings are provided separately, which can be useful in certain scenarios.
