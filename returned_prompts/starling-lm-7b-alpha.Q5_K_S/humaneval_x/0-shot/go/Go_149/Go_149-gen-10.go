The function SortedListSum(lst []string) []string first initializes two slices, temp and result.
The temp slice is used to store all odd length strings while the result slice is used to store all even length strings.
The function then traverses through the input list, lst, and checks if the length of each string is odd. If the length is odd, the string is added to the temp slice, otherwise it is added to the result slice.
After all strings have been sorted into the temp and result slices, the function sorts the temp and result slices using the sort.Strings() function.
Finally, the function concatenates the temp and result slices and returns the concatenated slice as the result.

The time complexity of this function is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the number of strings in the input list.
The space complexity is O(n) due to the allocation of the temp and result slices.

This solution assumes that all strings in the input list have the same length, as stated in the question.

Here are some assert tests for the function:

assert SortedListSum([]string{"aa", "a", "aaa"}) == []string{"aa"}
assert SortedListSum([]string{"ab", "a", "aaa", "cd"}) == []string{"ab", "cd"}

Note that the assert function
