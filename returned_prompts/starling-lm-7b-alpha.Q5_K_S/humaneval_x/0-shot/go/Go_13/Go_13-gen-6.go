In the given code, a function GreatestCommonDivisor is defined to compute the greatest common divisor of two integers a and b using Euclidean algorithm. This function returns an integer value.

The code uses if condition to check if a is less than b. If condition is true, it swaps the values of a and b using a temporary variable temp.

After swapping, it initializes a variable r with the remainder value of a and b. Then, it enters a for loop that continues until the remainder is zero.

In each iteration of the for loop, it updates the value of r with the remainder of a divided by b, updates the value of a with the value of b, and updates the value of b with the value of r.

Finally, it returns the value of a, which is the greatest common divisor of the two input integers.

To use this function, you can call it with two integer arguments, like this:

```go
result := GreatestCommonDivisor(3, 5)
fmt.Println(result)
```

This will print the greatest common divisor of 3 and 5, which is 1.

You can also call the function with different integer values to find their greatest common divisor.

```go
result := GreatestCommonDivisor(25, 15)
fmt.Println(result)
```

This will print the greatest common divisor of 25 and 15, which is 5.

```go
result := GreatestCommonDivisor(9, 12)
fmt.Println(result)
```

This will print
