```python
def GreatestCommonDivisor(a, b):
    while b > 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```

The above Python code defines a function called `GreatestCommonDivisor` that takes two integer arguments, `a` and `b`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. The algorithm repeatedly divides `a` by `b` and replaces `a` with `b` and `b` with the remainder of the division until `b` becomes zero. The final value of `a` is the GCD of the original `a` and `b`. The function returns this value.

The function is defined within a block, which means it can only be called from within the block. It is not accessible from outside the block.

Here's an example usage of the function:

```python
print(GreatestCommonDivisor(3, 5))  # Output: 1
print(GreatestCommonDivisor(25, 15))  # Output: 5
```

In the first example, the GCD of 3 and 5 is 1. In the second example, the GCD of 25 and 15 is 5.

Overall, the function `GreatestCommonDivisor` is a useful tool for finding the GCD of two integers in Python.

Here are some additional notes about the function:

- The function uses the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the GCD of two numbers. It works by repeatedly dividing the larger number by the smaller number and replacing the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder of the division until the remainder becomes zero. The final value of the larger number is the GCD of the original two numbers.
- The function is defined within a block, which means it can only be called from within the block. It is not accessible from outside the block.
- The function is recursive, meaning it calls itself within its own definition. In this case, the recursion is indirect, as the function calls itself within a while loop rather than directly.

Overall, the function `GreatestCommonDivisor`
