To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers a and b, you can use Euclid's algorithm. Here's how you can implement it in Go:

```go
func GreatestCommonDivisor(a int, b int) int {
    for b != 0 {
        a, b = b, a%b
    }
    return a
}
```

In this implementation, we use a `for` loop to repeatedly update `a` and `b` until `b` becomes zero. Inside the loop, we update `a` to the value of `b`, and `b` to the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. This process continues until `b` becomes zero, at which point `a` will hold the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`.

For example, if you call `GreatestCommonDivisor(3, 5)`, the function will return `1` because the GCD of 3 and 5 is 1. If you call `GreatestCommonDivisor(25, 15)`, the function will return `5` because the GCD of 25 and 15 is 5.

Here's an example of how you can use the `GreatestCommonDivisor` function in your Go program:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println(GreatestCommonDivisor(3, 5))  // Output: 1
    fmt.Println(GreatestCommonDivisor(25, 15)) // Output: 5
}
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println(GreatestCommonDivisor(3, 5))  // Output: 1
    fmt.Println(GreatestCommonDivisor(25, 15)) // Output: 5
}
```

```go
func GreatestCommonDivisor(a int, b int) int {
    for b != 0 {
        a, b = b, a%b
