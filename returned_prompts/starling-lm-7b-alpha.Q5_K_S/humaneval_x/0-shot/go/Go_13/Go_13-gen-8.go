The Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers a and b is the largest positive integer that divides both a and b without leaving a remainder. In mathematics, the GCD of two integers is the smallest non-zero integer that divides the two numbers without remainder. In computer programming, the GCD is implemented in various ways, including using recursive functions, iteration, and Euclidean algorithm.

Here is an example of a recursive function that implements the GCD:

```go
func GreatestCommonDivisor(a int, b int) int {
    if b == 0 {
        return a
    }
    return GreatestCommonDivisor(b, a % b)
}
```

This function works by repeatedly subtracting the remainder of a divided by b from a until b is zero. At that point, a will be the GCD of the two original numbers.

Here is an example of the Euclidean algorithm that implements the GCD:

```go
func GreatestCommonDivisor(a int, b int) int {
    for b != 0 {
        a, b = b, a % b
    }
    return a
}
```

This function works by repeatedly swapping a and b and setting a equal to the remainder of a divided by b, until b is zero. At that point, a will be the GCD of the two original numbers.

Both functions will return the GCD of the two integers passed to them, and they will return the result of the calculation.

```go
fmt.Println(GreatestCommonDivisor(3, 5)) // 1
fmt.Println(GreatestCommonDivisor(25, 15)) // 5
```

The output of the two functions will be printed, showing the result of the GCD calculation.

```
1
5
```

The GreatestCommonDivisor function is a useful tool in computer programming, especially when working with integers.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func GreatestCommonDivisor(a int, b int) int {
    if b == 0 {
        return a
    }
    return
