In this code, the GreatestCommonDivisor function is defined to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers, a and b. The function uses the Euclidean algorithm to recursively calculate the GCD. Here's how it works:

1. The function takes two integer parameters, a and b, and returns an integer.
2. Inside the function, it checks if the remainder of a divided by b (a % b) is equal to 0. If it is, it means that b is the GCD of a and b, so it returns b.
3. If the remainder is not 0, the function recursively calls itself with the arguments (b, a % b). This means that it continues to calculate the GCD by dividing the larger number (b) by the remainder (a % b).
4. The recursion continues until the remainder is 0, at which point the GCD is found.
5. The function then returns the GCD as the result of the calculation.

In the provided code examples, the GreatestCommonDivisor function is called with different values of a and b to demonstrate its usage. The first example (GreatestCommonDivisor(3, 5)) returns 1, as the GCD of 3 and 5 is 1. The second example (GreatestCommonDivisor(25, 15)) returns 5, as the GCD of 25 and 15 is 5.

Overall, the GreatestCommonDivisor function is a recursive implementation of the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the GCD of two integers.

// >>> GreatestCommonDivisor(3, 5)
// 1

// >>> GreatestCommonDivisor(25, 15)
// 5

```
// Return a greatest common divisor of two integers a and b
func GreatestCommonDivisor(a int, b int) int {
    if (a % b == 0) {
        return b
    } else {
        return GreatestCommonDivisor(b
