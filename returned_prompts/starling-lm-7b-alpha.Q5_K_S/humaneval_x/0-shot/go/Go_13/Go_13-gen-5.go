Here's a quick overview of the Euclidean algorithm:

1. While a and b are both nonzero, do the following steps:
    a. If a is greater than b, set a equal to a modulo b. Otherwise, set b equal to b modulo a.
    b. Set a equal to a and b equal to the remainder.
    c. Repeat steps a and b until a is equal to 1. At this point, the greatest common divisor of a and b is equal to b.

The function GreatestCommonDivisor takes two integers a and b, and returns the greatest common divisor of these two integers.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of how the function works:

1. Check if a and b are both nonzero. If either of them is zero, return the other number. This is the base case of the Euclidean algorithm.
2. If a is greater than b, set a equal to a modulo b. Otherwise, set b equal to b modulo a. This step ensures that a is always greater than or equal to b.
3. Set a equal to a and b equal to the remainder of a modulo b. This step moves the problem one step closer to the base case of the Euclidean algorithm.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until a is equal to 1. At this point, the greatest common divisor of a and b is equal to b.
5. Return the value of b.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

- Line 1 defines a function called GreatestCommonDivisor that takes two integer parameters, a and b.
- Line 2 checks if either a or b is zero. If either of them is zero, the function returns the other number. This is the base case of the Euclidean algorithm.
- Line 3 checks if a is greater than b. If a is greater than b, line 4 sets a equal to a modulo b. Otherwise, line 5 sets b equal to b modulo a. This step ensures that a is always greater than or equal to b.
- Line 6 sets a equal to a and b equal to the remainder of a modulo b. This step moves the problem one step closer to the base case of the Euclidean
