The Strlen function returns the length of the given string.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func Strlen(str string) int {
    return len(str)
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(Strlen("")) // 0
    fmt.Println(Strlen("abc")) // 3
}
```

The Strlen function uses the built-in `len` function to calculate the length of the string. This function returns an integer representing the length of the given string.

The `len` function is a built-in Go function that returns the length of a string. It can be used with any type that is indexable by bytes, such as slices, byte arrays, and strings.

In the code provided, the Strlen function is tested by calling it with two different strings: an empty string and the string "abc". The expected output is printed using the `fmt.Println` function.

When the Strlen function is called with an empty string, it returns 0, as there are no characters in the string. When it is called with the string "abc", it returns 3, as there are three characters in the string.

Overall, the Strlen function provides a convenient way to calculate the length of a given string in Go.

// Return length of given string
// >>> Strlen('')
// 0
// >>> Strlen('abc')
// 3
func Strlen(str string) int {
    return len(str)
}

This is a Go function that calculates the length of a given string. The function takes a string as input and returns an integer representing the length of the string. It uses the built-in `len` function to calculate the length of the string.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The function `Strlen` is defined with the signature `func Strlen(str string) int`. This means that the function takes a string as input and returns an integer.
2. Inside the function, the `len` function is called with the input string `str` as the argument. The `len` function returns the length of the string.
3. The length of the string is then returned as the result of the `Strlen` function.
