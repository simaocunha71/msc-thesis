    len(str)
}

The provided Go code defines a function named `Strlen` that takes a string as an argument and returns the length of the string as an integer. The `len()` function in Go is used to obtain the length of a string, slice, array, map, or channel. In this case, it is used to calculate the length of the input string `str`.

To use this function, you can pass a string as an argument when calling `Strlen()`. For example, `Strlen('')` returns 0 because an empty string has no characters, and `Strlen('abc')` returns 3 because the string 'abc' has three characters.

The `len()` function automatically calculates the length of the input, so you don't need to manually count the characters in the string.

Overall, the `Strlen` function provides a convenient way to determine the length of a string in Go, without having to manually iterate through the characters.

Here's an example of how to use the `Strlen` function:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println(Strlen("Hello, World!")) // Output: 13
    fmt.Println(Strlen(""))             // Output: 0
}
```

In this example, the `Strlen` function is called with two different strings: "Hello, World!" and an empty string. The function correctly calculates the length of each string and prints the results.

It's worth noting that the `len()` function in Go is not limited to strings; it can also be used with other types like slices, arrays, maps, and channels. However, in this specific example, the `Strlen` function is designed to work with strings only.

In summary, the `Strlen` function in Go provides a concise and efficient way to determine the length of a string.
