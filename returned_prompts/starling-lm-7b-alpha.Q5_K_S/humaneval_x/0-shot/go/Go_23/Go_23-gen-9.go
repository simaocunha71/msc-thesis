The function Strlen takes in a string and returns the length of the given string.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func Strlen(str string) int {
    return len(str)
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(Strlen("")) // 0
    fmt.Println(Strlen("abc")) // 3
}
```

This program defines a function Strlen that takes a string as an argument and returns its length using the built-in function len. The function len returns the number of runes (Unicode characters) in the string.

In the main function, we call Strlen with two different strings: an empty string and the string "abc". The output of the program will be:

```
0
3
```

This means that the length of an empty string is 0, while the length of the string "abc" is 3, as there are three characters in the string.

Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. We define a function Strlen that takes a string as an argument and returns an integer.
2. Inside the function, we use the built-in function len to get the length of the input string.
3. In the main function, we call Strlen with two different strings and print the result using fmt.Println.
4. The output of the program is the length of the two strings, printed to the console.

Overall, this program demonstrates a simple way to find the length of a string in Go.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func Strlen(str string) int {
    return len(str)
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(Strlen("")) // 0
    fmt.Println(Strlen("abc")) // 3
}
```

By using this function, you can easily find the length of any given string in Go.

Here are some additional tips for using this function effectively:

- Make sure to pass a valid string as an argument to Strlen, as the function will return an error if the input is not a valid string.
- You can use Strlen in combination with other string manipulation functions, such as Substring, to extract specific parts of
