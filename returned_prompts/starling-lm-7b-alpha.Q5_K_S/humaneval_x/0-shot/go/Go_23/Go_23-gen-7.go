    length := 0

    for _, v := range str {
        length++
    }

    return length
}

In the above code, I have implemented a function to calculate the length of a given string. I am using the range keyword to iterate over the string and then incrementing the length variable by 1 for each character in the string.

To test the function, I have provided two test cases. The first test case with an empty string returns 0, as expected. The second test case with the string "abc" returns 3, which is also correct.

The function Strlen takes a string as an argument and returns an integer representing the length of the string.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The function Strlen is defined with a single parameter, str, of type string.
2. The variable length is declared and initialized to 0.
3. A for loop is used to iterate over each character in the string str. The range keyword is used to get each character in the string, and the underscore (_) is used to ignore the index.
4. Inside the loop, the length variable is incremented by 1 for each character in the string.
5. After the loop finishes, the length variable contains the total number of characters in the string.
6. The length variable is returned as the result of the function.

Overall, this code provides a simple and efficient way to calculate the length of a given string in Go.

// Return length of given string
// >>> Strlen('')
// 0
// >>> Strlen('abc')
// 3
func Strlen(str string) int {

    length := 0

    for _, v := range str {
        length++
    }

    return length
}
