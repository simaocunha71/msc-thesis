I am having trouble understanding the logic behind this function. What is the logic behind the for loop in this function?

The logic behind the for loop in the function CountUpper is to iterate through the string s and only consider the characters at even indices. 

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. The for loop is initialized with `i := 0` and increments `i` by 2 in each iteration using `i += 2`. This ensures that `i` only takes even values, as indicated by the condition `i < len(s)`.

2. Inside the loop, the `if` statement checks if the character at index `i` is an uppercase vowel. This is done by using the `strings.ContainsRune()` function with the string `s` and the uppercase vowel range `rune('A')-rune('a')`. If the character at index `i` is an uppercase vowel, the `if` condition is true and the `count` variable is incremented by 1.

3. The loop continues until `i` reaches the length of the string `s`. At each iteration, the character at index `i` is considered, and if it is an uppercase vowel, the `count` variable is incremented.

4. Finally, the function returns the value of the `count` variable, which represents the number of uppercase vowels found in even indices of the input string `s`.

Overall, the logic behind the for loop in the CountUpper function is to iterate through the string and count the number of uppercase vowels at even indices, providing the desired result.





In the CountUpper function, what is the purpose of the condition `strings.ContainsRune(s, s[i], rune('A')-rune('a'))`?
