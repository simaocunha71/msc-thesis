I tried this code.
But I can't get the correct answer.
Please tell me the correct answer.



I don't understand the above code.




The above code is a function that takes a string `s` as input and counts the number of uppercase vowels in even indices. 

In the code, an array `vowels` is defined containing the uppercase vowels 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', and 'U'. 

The function uses a `for` loop to iterate through each character in the string `s`. 

Inside the loop, it checks if the index of the current character is even (i.e., `i%2 == 0`). 

If the index is even, it then checks if the current character is a vowel by using the `strings.ContainsRune()` function to check if the vowel is present in the `vowels` array. 

If the vowel is present, the `count` variable is incremented by 1. 

Finally, the function returns the total count of uppercase vowels in even indices. 

For example, if you call the function with the string `"aBCdEf"`, it will return 1 because there is one uppercase vowel (`'B'`) in an even index (index 1). 

If you call the function with the string `"abcdefg"`, it will return 0 because there are no uppercase vowels in even indices. 

If you call the function with the string `"dBBE"`, it will also return 0 because there are no uppercase vowels in even
