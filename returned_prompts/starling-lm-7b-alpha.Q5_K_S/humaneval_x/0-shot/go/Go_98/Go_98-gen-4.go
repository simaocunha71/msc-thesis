I'm wondering if there's a more efficient way to solve this problem? I'm not sure if using the modulo operator twice is the best way to solve this problem, although it is correct.

Another possible solution is to use the `strings.Map()` function, but it may not be the most efficient solution.

Here are some possible solutions:

1. Using the modulo operator twice

The reason we use the modulo operator twice is because we need to check whether the index is even, and if it is, we need to check whether the corresponding character is an uppercase vowel.

For example, if `s` is "aBCdEf", the index of `'B'` is `1 % 2 = 1`, which is odd, so we skip it. The index of `'C'` is `2 % 2 = 0`, which is even, and `'C'` is not an uppercase vowel, so we skip it. The index of `'A'` is `3 % 2 = 1`, which is odd, so we skip it. The index of `'B'` is `4 % 2 = 0`, which is even, and `'B'` is an uppercase vowel, so we increment the `count` variable. The index of `'E'` is `5 % 2 = 1`, which is odd, so we skip it. The index of `'f'` is `6 % 2 = 0`, which is even, and `'f'` is not an uppercase vowel, so we skip it. Therefore, the result is `1`.

2. Using the `strings.Map()` function

The `strings.Map()` function can be used to convert each character in the string to a function that returns `true` if the character is an upper
