I have a problem, I have a function to count uppercase vowels in even indices of a string, but it doesn't work, what's wrong with my function?

My function is supposed to return 0 for "abcdefg", "dBBE", and any string that does not contain any uppercase vowels in even indices, and it should return 1 for "aBCdEf" and any string that contains uppercase vowels in even indices. However, it doesn't work, and I don't know why.

The function is as follows:

```go
func CountUpper(s string) int {
    count := 0
    for i, v := range s {
        if i%2 == 0 && (v >= 'A' && v <= 'Z') {
            count++
        }
    }
    return count
}
```

The above function does not meet the requirements.

The function should return 0 for "abcdefg", "dBBE", and any string that does not contain any uppercase vowels in even indices, and it should return 1 for "aBCdEf" and any string that contains uppercase vowels in even indices. However, the function does not meet this requirement.

The problem with the function is that the `range` statement in Go returns both the index and the value of the string, and the index returned by `range` starts from 0, while the requirement states that the index should start from 1.

To fix this, we can add 1 to the index returned by `range` before using it. Here's the modified
