    count := 0
    for i := 0; i < len(s); i++ {
        if i%2 == 0 {
            if strings.ContainsRune(s, 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U') {
                count++
            }
        }
    }
    return count
}

I have a question about the logic of CountUpper function, when i run the CountUpper function on "aBCdEf" it gives the output 1, I understand why it gives 1 but when I run it on "aBCDf" it should give 1 but it gives 0, why is that?
