In this implementation, we define a function called `SpecialFactorial` that takes an integer `n` as input. The function uses a recursive approach to calculate the Brazilian factorial of the input number.

The base case of the recursion is when `n` is less than 2. In this case, we return 1 because the factorial of any number less than 2 is defined as 1.

For any other value of `n`, we recursively call the `SpecialFactorial` function with the argument `n-1` and multiply the result by `n`. This process continues until the base case is reached.

To test the implementation, we can run the code using the `go run` command followed by the name of the file containing the code (`main.go` in this case). The code will calculate and print the Brazilian factorial of the input number, which is `288` in this case.
