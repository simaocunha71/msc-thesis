This program calculates the Brazilian factorial of a given integer. It initializes a variable `result` to 1. Then, it iterates through the numbers from 1 to the input `n` and multiplies each number to the `result`. After the loop, it multiplies the `result` by itself again. Finally, it returns the `result` as the Brazilian factorial of the input.

To solve this problem, you can use the provided `SpecialFactorial` function. Pass the desired integer as an argument to the function, and it will return the Brazilian factorial of that number.

Here's an example usage of the `SpecialFactorial` function:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    result := SpecialFactorial(4)
    fmt.Println(result)
}
```

In this example, we call the `SpecialFactorial` function with the argument `4`. The function calculates the Brazilian factorial of 4, which is 288, and assigns it to the `result` variable. Finally, we print the `result` to the console, which will display `288` as the output.
