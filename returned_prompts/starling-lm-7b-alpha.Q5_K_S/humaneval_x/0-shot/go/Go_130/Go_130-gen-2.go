In this program, we use a for loop to generate the first n+1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence. We use an if and an else if statement to initialize the first 3 numbers of the sequence, which are hard coded into the program. We also use a for loop to calculate the rest of the numbers of the sequence. We use a temporary variable to store the sum of the last 3 numbers of the sequence.

The time complexity of this program is O(n) because we only need to generate the first n+1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.

The space complexity of this program is O(n) because we use an array to store the numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.

In conclusion, the time and space complexity of this program is O(n), which is optimal for this problem.

This program will output the first n+1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.

For example, if you input 3, the program will output [1, 3, 2, 8].
