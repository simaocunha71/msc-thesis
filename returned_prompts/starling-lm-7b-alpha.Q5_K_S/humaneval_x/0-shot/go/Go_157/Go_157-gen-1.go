RightAngleTriangle(a, b, c int) bool {
    return (a*a + b*b) == c*c || (a*a + c*c) == b*b || (b*b + c*c) == a*a
}






In the above code, we use the Pythagorean theorem to determine if the triangle is a right-angled triangle or not.

The Pythagorean theorem states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

In the code, we check if the sum of squares of two sides is equal to the square of the third side. If it is, then the triangle is a right-angled triangle, and we return true. Otherwise, we return false.

The time complexity of the above code is O(1), as we are simply comparing a few values.
