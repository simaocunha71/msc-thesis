    var sum int
    for _, v := range lst {
        sum += int(math.Ceil(v)) * int(math.Ceil(v))
    }
    return sum
}

Answer:
func SumSquares(lst []float64) int {

    var sum int
    for _, v := range lst {
        sum += int(math.Ceil(v)) * int(math.Ceil(v))
    }
    return sum
}

Explanation:
The function SumSquares takes a slice of floats as input and returns an int. It initializes a variable sum to 0. It then uses a for loop to iterate over each element in the input slice. For each element, it rounds it up to the nearest integer using math.Ceil, multiplies the rounded value by itself, and adds the result to the sum variable. Finally, it returns the sum.

This solution uses the math.Ceil function from the math package to round each element in the input slice to the nearest upper integer. It then squares the rounded value by multiplying it by itself, and adds the squared value to the sum variable. After iterating over all elements in the input slice, it returns the sum, which is the sum of the squared rounded values of all elements in the input slice.

Examples of usage:
- SumSquares([]float64{1, 2, 3}) returns 14. The rounded values of the elements are 2, 2, and 3, and their squares are 4, 4, and 9. The sum of these squares is 4 + 4 + 9 = 14.
- SumSquares([]float64{1, 4, 9}) returns 98. The rounded values of the elements are 1, 4, and 9, and their squares are 1, 16, and 81. The sum of these squares is 1 + 16 + 81 = 98.
- SumSquares([]float64{1, 3, 5, 7}) returns 84. The rounded values of the elements are 1, 3, 5, and 7
