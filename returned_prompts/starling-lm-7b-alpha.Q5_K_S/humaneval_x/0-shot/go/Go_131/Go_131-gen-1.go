    product := 1
    for n > 0 {
        d := n % 10
        if d%2 != 0 {
            product *= d
        }
        n /= 10
    }
    return product

}


Answer:

This solution works by first initializing a variable called 'product' to 1. Then, while the input number 'n' is greater than 0, it performs the following steps:

1. It uses the modulo operator '%' to get the last digit of 'n' and assigns it to a variable called 'd'.
2. It checks if 'd' is odd by using the condition 'd%2 != 0'. If 'd' is odd, it multiplies the 'product' by 'd' and updates the 'product' variable.
3. It divides 'n' by 10 to remove the last digit from 'n' and continues the loop until all digits have been processed.
4. Finally, it returns the 'product' variable, which is the product of all the odd digits in the input number. If all digits are even, the 'product' will remain 1, and the function will return 0.

This solution effectively solves the problem by iterating through each digit of the input number and only multiplying the 'product' if the digit is odd.

Here is an example of how the function can be used:

fmt.Println(Digits(1))  // Output: 1
fmt.Println(Digits(4))  // Output: 0
fmt.Println(Digits(235)) // Output: 15
