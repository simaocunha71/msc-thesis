    h := md5.New()
    h.Write([]byte(text))

    return fmt.Sprintf("%x", h.Sum(nil))
}




In the above Go program, the function StringToMd5 takes a string as input and returns its md5 hash equivalent string. If the input string is empty, the function returns nil. Here's how the code works:

1. The function begins by creating a new MD5 hash object using the md5.New() function. This object is stored in the variable h.
2. The input string is written to the hash object using the Write() method of the h object. This method takes a byte slice as input, so the string must be converted to a byte slice using the []byte(text) syntax.
3. After the input string is written to the hash object, the Sum() method of the h object is called. This method returns the MD5 hash value as a byte slice. The Sum() method is called with a nil pointer as the second argument, as the code doesn't need to store the original hash value.
4. The fmt.Sprintf("%x", h.Sum(nil)) line is used to format the hash value as a hexadecimal string. The %x format specifier is used to specify that the hash value should be formatted as a hexadecimal string.
5. Finally, the formatted hash value is returned as the result of the function.

It's important to note that the StringToMd5 function returns an interface{} type, which means it can return any type of value. In this case, the function returns the md5 hash value as a hexadecimal string, but it could return other types of values depending on the requirements of the program.

Overall, the StringToMd5 function provides a convenient way to calculate the MD5 hash of a given string in Go.
