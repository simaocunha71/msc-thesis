    h := md5.New()
    _, _ = fmt.Fprint(h, text)
    return h.Sum(nil)


Explanation:
To calculate the md5 hash of a string, first create a new md5 hasher by calling md5.New().
Then, using the Fprint function from the fmt package, print the string to the hasher. Note that Fprint returns two values, but we don't use the second one in this case.
Finally, return the hash sum from the hasher using the Sum method, and pass a nil pointer as the argument.


Note: The code above also demonstrates a common idiom in Go for ignoring errors, which is generally considered bad practice. In this case, however, the errors are only being ignored because they are not relevant to the solution.
