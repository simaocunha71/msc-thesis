    md5Context := md5.New()
    md5Context.Write([]byte(text))

    result := md5Context.Sum(nil)
    return fmt.Sprintf("%x", result)
}


In the code, the StringToMd5 function uses the md5 package in the crypto module to return the md5 hash equivalent string of a given text. It first creates a new md5 context, then writes the text to the md5 context and calculates the result. Finally, it returns the result by using the fmt.Sprintf method to convert the result to a hexadecimal string.

If the input text is an empty string, the function will return nil.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the text. The md5 calculation process iterates through each byte in the text, so the time complexity is proportional to the length of the text.

The space complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the text. The md5 calculation process requires storing the entire text in memory, so the space complexity is proportional to the length of the text.

This implementation of StringToMd5 has a reasonable time and space complexity for calculating md5 hash equivalents of strings, and can be used in scenarios where the md5 hash equivalent of a string is needed.
