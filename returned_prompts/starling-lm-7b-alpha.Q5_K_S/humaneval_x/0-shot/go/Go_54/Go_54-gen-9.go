// This solution uses a map to count the occurrence of each character in the first string.
// Then it checks if the number of each character in the second string is the same as the first string.

Go is case sensitive, so 'a' and 'A' are considered different characters.

The function SameChars takes two string arguments, s0 and s1. It returns a boolean value indicating if the two strings contain the same characters, regardless of the order they appear.

In the solution, two maps, m1 and m2, are created to store the count of each character in the two strings. The range keyword is used to iterate over the strings and the underscore (_) is a blank identifier that is used when we don't need the value itself.

The reflect.DeepEqual function is then used to compare the two maps. This function compares the elements of the two maps and returns true if they have the same key-value pairs.

Finally, the result is returned by the function.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the longest string.

The space complexity of this solution is also O(n), as we are storing the count of each character in the two maps.

The solution works by counting the occurrence of each character in the first string and then checking if the number of each character in the second string is the same as the first string.

This solution is case sensitive, so it treats 'a' and 'A' as different characters.

The function SameChars returns a boolean value, indicating if the two strings contain the same characters or not.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the longest string.

The space complexity of this solution is also O(n), as we are storing the count of each character in the two maps.
