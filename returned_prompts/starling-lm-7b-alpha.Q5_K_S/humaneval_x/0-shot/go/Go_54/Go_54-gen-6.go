To determine if two words have the same characters, we can compare the length of the words and if the length is not the same, then the characters are not the same. Next, we sort both strings and compare the sorted strings. If the sorted strings are the same, then the characters are the same.

```go
func SameChars(s0 string, s1 string) bool {
    return len(s0) == len(s1) && sorted(s0) == sorted(s1)
}
```

Here's the breakdown of the logic:

1. If the lengths of the two strings are different, the characters are different.
2. If the lengths are the same, we sort both strings.
3. If the sorted strings are the same, then the characters are the same.
4. If the sorted strings are not the same, then the characters are not the same.


This solution will return true if two strings have the same characters, and false if the strings have different characters.
