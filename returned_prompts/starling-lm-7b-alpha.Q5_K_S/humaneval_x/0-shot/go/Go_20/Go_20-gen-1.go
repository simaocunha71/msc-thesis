Explanation

In this function, we're using two for loops to iterate over the list of numbers and compare each number to all the other numbers that come after it.

This allows us to compare each number in the list to all the other numbers in the list, and find the closest pair. We're also using the math.MaxFloat64 value as a placeholder for our minimum value, which ensures that the minimum value will always be less than the maximum float64 value.

Once we find the minimum value, we update our a and b variables to the two numbers that were closest to each other. We then return these two numbers as a tuple.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the input list, because of the two nested for loops. However, since the input list is guaranteed to have at least two elements, this function will always find the closest pair of numbers.

Here's an example usage of the function:

package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "math"
)

func main() {
    numbers := []float64{1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2}
    a, b := FindClosestElements(numbers)
    fmt.Printf("%.2f, %.2f\n", a, b)
}

When we run this program, we get the following output:

2.00, 2.20

This indicates that the two closest numbers in the input list are 2.0 and 2.2.
