// First, we need to sort the numbers in ascending order.
sort.Float64s(numbers)

// Next, we calculate the difference between each pair of consecutive numbers.
diff := make([]float64, len(numbers)-1)
for i := 0; i < len(numbers)-1; i++ {
    diff[i] = numbers[i+1] - numbers[i]
}

// Find the smallest difference.
smallestDiff := diff[0]
smallestDiffIndex := 0
for i := 0; i < len(diff); i++ {
    if diff[i] < smallestDiff {
        smallestDiff = diff[i]
        smallestDiffIndex = i
    }
}

// Return the pair with smallest difference.
return [2]float64{numbers[smallestDiffIndex], numbers[smallestDiffIndex+1]}

In this solution, we start by sorting the array of numbers in ascending order using the sort.Float64s() function. Then we calculate the difference between each consecutive pair of numbers and store them in a new slice called "diff". We then find the smallest difference among all the calculated differences and store its index in a variable called "smallestDiffIndex". Finally, we return the two numbers whose difference is the smallest from the original array.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting step, and a space complexity of O(n) for the "diff" slice.

The code provided can be used as a reference to find the two closest numbers in any given list of numbers, ensuring the returned pair is in ascending order.
