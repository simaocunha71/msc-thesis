In this problem we're asked to return the two closest elements from a slice of floating point numbers, and the order of the result should be the smaller number followed by the larger number.

The algorithm used in this function is a nested for loop to compare all possible combinations of numbers in the supplied slice. For each pair of numbers, the difference between them is calculated, and if the difference is smaller than the current minimum difference, the minimum difference is updated, and the closest pair of numbers is updated.

The function then returns the closest pair of numbers as a slice.
