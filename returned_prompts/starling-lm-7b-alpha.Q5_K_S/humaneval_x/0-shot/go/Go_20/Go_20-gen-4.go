To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Sort the `numbers` slice in ascending order. This will make it easier to find the two closest elements.

2. Initialize a variable `minDistance` to track the minimum distance between two elements. Set it to positive infinity initially.

3. Initialize two variables `smallestIndex` and `largestIndex` to track the indices of the two closest elements. Set them to -1 initially.

4. Iterate through the sorted `numbers` slice using a nested loop. For each pair of elements, calculate the absolute difference between them and compare it to the current `minDistance`. If the absolute difference is smaller than the current `minDistance`, update `minDistance`, `smallestIndex`, and `largestIndex` with the values of the current pair.

5. After the loop, return the two closest elements by accessing the `numbers` slice using the `smallestIndex` and `largestIndex` variables.

Here is the implementation of the solution in Go:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "math"
    "sort"
)

func FindClosestElements(numbers []float64) [2]float64 {
    sort.Float64s(numbers)

    minDistance := math.MaxFloat64
    smallestIndex := -1
    largestIndex := -1

    for i := 0; i < len(numbers)-1; i++ {
        for j := i + 1; j < len(numbers); j++ {
            distance := math.Abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j])
            if distance < minDistance {
                minDistance = distance
                smallestIndex = i
                largestIndex = j
            }
        }
    }

    return [2]float64{numbers[smallestIndex], numbers[largestIndex]}
}
```

You can use the `FindClosestElements` function by passing in a slice of numbers. It will return a slice of two elements that are the closest to each other in the input slice.

For example:

```go
numbers := []float64{1.0,
