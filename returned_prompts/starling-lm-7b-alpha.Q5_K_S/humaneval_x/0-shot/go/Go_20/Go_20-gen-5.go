To find the two elements that are closest to each other, you can use a sorting algorithm to sort the numbers in ascending order. Once sorted, you can compare the adjacent elements to find the closest pair. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. Sort the numbers in ascending order using the sort.Float64 function from the "sort" package. This function takes a pointer to a slice of float64 and sorts the slice in ascending order.

2. Initialize a variable named "minDifference" to a large value, such as math.MaxFloat64. This variable will store the minimum difference between consecutive elements.

3. Iterate through the sorted slice using a for loop. For each iteration, compare the absolute difference between the current element and the next element with the current value of "minDifference". If the difference is smaller than the current "minDifference", update "minDifference" with the new value and store the current and next elements in the "result" slice.

4. After iterating through the entire slice, return the "result" slice, which will contain the two elements that are closest to each other.

Here's the code implementation of the solution:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
	"sort"
)

func FindClosestElements(numbers []float64) [2]float64 {
	sort.Float64s(numbers)
	minDifference := math.MaxFloat64
	result := [2]float64{}

	for i := 0; i < len(numbers)-1; i++ {
		diff := math.Abs(numbers[i] - numbers[i+1])
		if diff < minDifference {
			minDifference = diff
			result[0] = numbers[i]
			result[1] = numbers[i+1]
		}
	}

	return result
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(FindClosestElements([]float64{1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2}))
	fmt.Print
