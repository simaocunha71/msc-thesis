The above function finds the closest two elements in a given array of numbers and returns them in the order of their original appearance in the array.



The function starts by initializing the minimum value and its index to the first element of the array. It then iterates through the array, comparing the absolute difference between each element and the first element of the result array. If a smaller absolute difference is found, the minimum value and its index are updated.

After iterating through the array, the function assigns the minimum value and the next value in the array to the result array. If the minimum index is equal to the length of the array minus one, it means that there is no next value, so the second value in the result array is set to NaN (Not a Number).

Finally, the function returns the result array, which contains the two closest elements in the original array.



In the provided examples, the function is called with two different arrays of numbers. In the first example, the closest pair of elements is (2.0, 2.2), and in the second example, the closest pair of elements is (2.0, 2.0). The function correctly returns these pairs of elements as the result.




In the given code, the function FindClosestElements takes an array of numbers and returns a result array of two elements. The result array is initialized with NaN values. The function then iterates through the input array, comparing the absolute difference between each element and the first element of the result array. If a smaller absolute difference is found, the minimum value and its index are updated. After iterating through the
