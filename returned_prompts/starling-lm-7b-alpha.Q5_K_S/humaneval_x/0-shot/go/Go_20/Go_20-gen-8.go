To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Sort the numbers in ascending order.
2. Initialize a variable `min` to be the absolute difference between the first two numbers in the sorted slice.
3. Iterate through the sorted slice. For each number, calculate the absolute difference between this number and the next one. If the absolute difference is less than `min`, update `min` and store the current number and the next number as the closest elements.
4. Return the closest elements.

Here's an example implementation of the solution in Go:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
	"sort"
)

func FindClosestElements(numbers []float64) [2]float64 {
	sort.Float64s(numbers)

	min := math.MaxFloat64
	var closestElements [2]float64

	for i := 0; i < len(numbers)-1; i++ {
		diff := math.Abs(numbers[i] - numbers[i+1])
		if diff < min {
			min = diff
			closestElements = [2]float64{numbers[i], numbers[i+1]}
		}
	}

	return closestElements
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(FindClosestElements([]float64{1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2})) // (2.0, 2.2)
	fmt.Println(FindClosestElements([]float64{1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0})) // (2.0, 2.0)
}
```

This program defines a function `FindClosestElements` that takes a slice of floating-point numbers as input and returns a slice of two floating-point numbers that are the closest to each other. The function first sorts the input numbers in ascending order using the `sort.Float64s` function from the `sort` package. Then, it initializes the `
