For a given number n, the function LargestDivisor(n) will return the largest number that divides n evenly, smaller than n. Here's a breakdown of the solution:

1. Start by initializing a variable "largestDivisor" with a value of 0. This variable will store the result of the function.

2. Use a for loop to iterate through the range of numbers from 2 to n. This range ensures that the divisor will always be smaller than the number itself.

3. Inside the loop, check if the remainder of n divided by the current iteration number (i) is equal to 0. If it is, that means i is a divisor of n.

4. If i is a divisor of n, update the "largestDivisor" variable with the current iteration number (i). This will store the largest divisor found so far.

5. Continue iterating until the for loop completes. At the end, the "largestDivisor" variable will contain the largest number that divides n evenly, smaller than n.

6. Finally, return the value of the "largestDivisor" variable as the result of the function.

Here's an example usage of the LargestDivisor function with the input 15:

largestDivisor := LargestDivisor(15)
fmt.Println(largestDivisor)

The output will be 5, which is the largest number that divides 15 evenly, smaller than 15.

This function can be used to find the largest divisor for any positive integer input.

Note: It's important to mention that this function assumes the input number (n) is a positive integer.

Here's the code for the LargestDivisor function in Go:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func LargestDivisor(n int) int {
    largestDivisor := 0

    for i := 2; i < n; i++ {
        if n % i == 0 {
            largestDivisor = i
        }
    }

    return largestDivisor
}

func main() {
