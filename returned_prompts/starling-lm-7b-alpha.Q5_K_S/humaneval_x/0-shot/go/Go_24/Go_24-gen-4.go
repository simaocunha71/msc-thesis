    var i = n
    for i > 0 {
        if n % i == 0 {
            return i
        }
        i--
    }
    return 0
}

// >>> LargestDivisor(30)
// 15
func LargestDivisor(n int) int {

    for i := n; i > 0; i-- {
        if n % i == 0 {
            return i
        }
    }
    return 0
}

The above function will return the largest divisor of the number.

Explanation:

This function is a simple function that finds the largest divisor of the number. It uses a for loop to iterate through the numbers from n to 1, and for each number, it checks if the number is a divisor of n (i.e., if n % i == 0). If it is, it returns the number. If no such number is found, it returns 0.

In the first implementation, the loop is a while loop that continues until i becomes 0. In the second implementation, the loop is a for loop that continues until i becomes 1.

Both implementations are correct, but the second implementation is more concise and efficient, as it only needs to check the divisibility of n for a single number (i.e., n % i == 0) instead of checking it for all numbers from n to 1.

The time complexity of both implementations is O(n), as the loop needs to iterate through all numbers from n to 1.

The space complexity of both implementations is O(1), as they only use a single variable (i) to store the current number being checked.

In summary, both implementations correctly find the largest divisor of the number, but the second implementation is more concise and efficient.
