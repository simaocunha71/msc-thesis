Explanation:

The LargestDivisor function takes an integer as an input and returns the largest number that divides the input number evenly, smaller than the input number.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the function works:

1. Initialize the divisor variable to 0. This variable will store the largest divisor found so far.
2. Use a for loop to iterate from 2 to n/2. This is because any number greater than n/2 cannot be a divisor of n.
3. Inside the loop, use the modulo operator (%) to check if the current number (i) is a divisor of the input number (n). If the modulo result is 0, it means that i is a divisor of n.
4. If i is a divisor of n, update the divisor variable with the current value of i. This ensures that the divisor variable always holds the largest divisor found so far.
5. After the loop finishes, return the value of the divisor variable, which is the largest number that divides the input number evenly, smaller than the input number.

For example, if you call LargestDivisor(15), the function will return 5, as 5 is the largest number that divides 15 evenly, smaller than 15.
