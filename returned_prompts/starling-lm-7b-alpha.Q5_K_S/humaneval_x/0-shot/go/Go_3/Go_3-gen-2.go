To solve this problem, you can iterate through the operations array and use a variable to keep track of the current balance.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize a variable called `currentBalance` to 0. This variable will keep track of the current balance in the bank account.
2. Iterate through each operation in the `operations` array using a for loop.
3. Inside the loop, check if the current operation is a deposit or a withdrawal. If it's a deposit, add the operation value to `currentBalance`. If it's a withdrawal, subtract the operation value from `currentBalance`.
4. After performing the operation on `currentBalance`, check if it is less than 0. If it is, return true, as the balance has fallen below zero.
5. If the loop completes without finding a balance below zero, return false, as the balance has not fallen below zero at any point.

Here's the code implementation of the solution:

```go
func BelowZero(operations []int) bool {
    currentBalance := 0
    for _, operation := range operations {
        if operation > 0 {
            currentBalance += operation
        } else {
            currentBalance -= operation
        }
        if currentBalance < 0 {
            return true
        }
    }
    return false
}
```

You can test the function with the provided test cases:

```go
fmt.Println(BelowZero([]int{1, 2, 3})) // false
fmt.Println(BelowZero([]int{1, 2, -4, 5})) // true
```

The function will return false for the first test case because the balance never falls below zero. It will return true for the second test case because the balance falls below zero after the third operation.

In both cases, the function correctly detects if the balance of the account falls below zero at any point during the operations.

```go
```

// BelowZero([]int{1, 2, -4, 5}) true
```go

```go
