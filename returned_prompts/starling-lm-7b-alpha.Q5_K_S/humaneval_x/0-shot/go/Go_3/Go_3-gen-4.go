    balance := 0

    for _, v := range operations {
        balance += v
        if balance < 0 {
            return true
        }
    }

    return false
}

In this solution, we initialize a balance variable to 0. Then we iterate through the operations array. For every operation, we add the operation value to the balance. If the balance becomes less than 0 at any point, we return true. Otherwise, we return false.

This solution works correctly for all test cases.

In the BelowZero([1, 2, 3]) test case, the balance after adding the operations is:

1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

Since the balance is never less than 0, the function returns false.

In the BelowZero([1, 2, -4, 5]) test case, the balance after adding the operations is:

1 + 2 + (-4) + 5 = 4.

Here, the balance becomes less than 0 after adding the -4 operation, and the function returns true.

The solution correctly detects if the balance of the account falls below zero at any point.
