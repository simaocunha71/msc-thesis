```go
func BelowZero(operations []int) bool {
    balance := 0
    for _, operation := range operations {
        balance += operation
        if balance < 0 {
            return true
        }
    }
    return false
}
```

The time complexity of this function is O(n) because it iterates over the array once.

The space complexity is O(1) because it uses a fixed amount of space (a single integer for balance) that doesn't depend on the size of the input array.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func BelowZero(operations []int) bool {
    balance := 0
    for _, operation := range operations {
        balance += operation
        if balance < 0 {
            return true
        }
    }
    return false
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(BelowZero([]int{1, 2, 3}))  // false
    fmt.Println(BelowZero([]int{1, 2, -4, 5})) // true
}
```

Explanation:

The `BelowZero` function takes an array of integers as input and returns a boolean value. It initializes a variable `balance` to 0. Then, it iterates over the input array using a `for` loop. For each element in the array, it adds the element to the `balance` variable. If the `balance` becomes negative at any point, it returns `true`. If the loop finishes without returning `true`, it means that the `balance` never fell below 0, and it returns `false`.

In the `main` function, we test the `BelowZero` function with two different arrays: `[1, 2, 3]` and `[1, 2, -4, 5]`. The first array represents a sequence of deposits, and the second array represents a mix of deposits and withdrawals. We print the result of each function call using `fmt.Println`.

The time complexity of the `BelowZero` function is O(n), where n is the length of the input array. This is because the function iterates over the array once using a `for` loop. The space complexity is O
