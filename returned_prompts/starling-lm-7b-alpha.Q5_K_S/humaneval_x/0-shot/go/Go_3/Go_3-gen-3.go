To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Initialize a variable `balance` to 0. This variable will keep track of the current balance of the bank account.
2. Iterate through the `operations` slice. For each operation, add it to the `balance` if it's positive and subtract it from the `balance` if it's negative.
3. After iterating through all the operations, check if the `balance` is less than 0. If it is, return true; otherwise, return false.

Here's the Go code that implements this solution:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func BelowZero(operations []int) bool {
    balance := 0
    for _, op := range operations {
        if op > 0 {
            balance += op
        } else {
            balance -= op
        }
        if balance < 0 {
            return true
        }
    }
    return false
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(BelowZero([]int{1, 2, 3}))  // false
    fmt.Println(BelowZero([]int{1, 2, -4, 5}))  // true
}
```

In this code, the `BelowZero` function takes a slice of integers `operations` as input. It initializes the `balance` variable to 0. Then, it iterates through each operation in the `operations` slice. If the operation is positive, it adds the operation value to the `balance`. If the operation is negative, it subtracts the operation value from the `balance`. After each operation, it checks if the `balance` is less than 0. If it is, the function returns true; otherwise, it continues to the next operation. Finally, if all operations have been processed and the `balance` is still non-negative, the function returns false.

In the `main` function, we call the `BelowZero` function with two test cases: `[1, 2, 3]` and `[1, 2, -4, 5]`. The expected outputs are `false` and `true`, respectively.

This solution ensures that the balance of the bank account never falls below zero, and it returns true
