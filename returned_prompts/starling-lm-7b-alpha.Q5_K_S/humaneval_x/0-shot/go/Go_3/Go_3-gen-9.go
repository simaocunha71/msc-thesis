To solve this problem, we can iterate through the operations and add the positive numbers to the balance,
and subtract the negative numbers from the balance. If at any point the balance falls below zero, we can return true.
Here's an example implementation of the solution in Python:

```python
def BelowZero(operations):
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation if operation > 0 else -operation
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

In this code, we initialize the `balance` variable to 0. Then we iterate through each `operation` in the `operations` list. If the `operation` is positive, we add it to the `balance`. If the `operation` is negative, we subtract it from the `balance`. After each operation, we check if the `balance` is less than 0. If it is, we return `True`, indicating that the balance has fallen below zero at some point. If we reach the end of the loop without returning `True`, we return `False`, indicating that the balance has never fallen below zero.

For example, if we call `BelowZero([1, 2, 3])`, the balance will be 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, which is greater than 0, so the function will return `False`. However, if we call `BelowZero([1, 2, -4, 5])`, the balance will be 1 + 2 - 4 + 5 = 4, which is greater than 0 initially, but at the third operation, the balance falls to -1, which is below 0, so the function will return `True`.

```python
print(BelowZero([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: False
print(BelowZero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # Output: True
```

This solution is efficient because it only requires a single loop through the `operations` list, and each operation only takes constant time to process. Therefore, the overall time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of operations.

```python
def BelowZero(operations):
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
