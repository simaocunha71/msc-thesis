    arr = append(arr, -1)
    sort.Ints(arr)
    for i := 0; i < len(arr)-1; i++ {
        if arr[i+1]-arr[i] > 1 {
            return false
        }
    }
    return true
}

// Time complexity: O(nlogn)

ANS:
Yes

Explanation:
First, we add a -1 to the end of the array. This is to make the range of the
array non-decreasing. Then we sort the array. If all of the elements in the array
are in consecutive order, we will return true. Otherwise, we will return false.

For example, if the array is [3, 4, 5, 1, 2], after sorting, the array is
[-1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Then, we can check if all of the elements are in consecutive
order. Here, 2-1=1, 3-2=1, 4-3=1, 5-4=1, and -1-5= -4. Since -4 is not 1, we
will return false.

So the final answer is True.
