    }
    for i := 1; i < len(arr); i++ {

Answer:
To determine if it is possible to sort the array by performing the right shift operation, we first check if the array is empty. If the array is empty, we return true since an empty array is considered sorted.

Next, we iterate through the array starting from the second element (i = 1) to the last element (i < len(arr)). For each element, we compare it with the previous element (arr[i-1]). If the previous element is greater than the current element, it means that the array is not sorted in non-decreasing order. In this case, we return false.

If the loop completes without finding any inconsistencies in the array, we can conclude that it is possible to obtain a sorted array by performing the right shift operation. In this case, we return true.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the array. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of additional space.

Note: This solution assumes that the array contains unique elements, as stated in the problem description.

In the provided example, MoveOneBall([3, 4, 5, 1, 2]), the function returns true. By performing two right shift operations, we can obtain the sorted array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

On the other hand, MoveOneBall([3, 5, 4, 1, 2]) returns false. There is no way to obtain a sorted array by performing any number of right shift operations on this array.

Overall, this solution effectively checks if it is possible to sort the given array using the right shift operation and returns the appropriate result.
