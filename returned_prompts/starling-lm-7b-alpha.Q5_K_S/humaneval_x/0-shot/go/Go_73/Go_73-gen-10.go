// One approach to solve this problem is to count the number of odd elements in the array.
// The minimum number of changes needed to make the array palindromic is the number of odd elements divided by 2.
// Here is how to count the odd elements:

oddCount := 0
for _, v := range arr {
	if v % 2 == 1 {
		oddCount++
	}
}

// Since the array is palindromic if the length is odd, we need to make sure the number of odd elements is at most 1.
// If the oddCount is greater than 1, we reduce it by 1. Otherwise, we return 0.
if oddCount > 1 {
	oddCount = 1
}

return oddCount

return oddCount
```

In this solution, we first count the number of odd elements in the array. Since an array is palindromic if its length is odd, we need to make sure the number of odd elements is at most 1. If the oddCount is greater than 1, we reduce it by 1. Otherwise, we return 0.

```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array.

```go
func SmallestChange(arr []int) int {
	oddCount := 0
	for _, v := range arr {
		if v % 2 == 1 {
			oddCount
