To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Sort the given array.
2. Find the middle element of the sorted array. If the array length is odd, the middle element will be the element at index len(arr) / 2. Otherwise, it will be the average of the elements at index len(arr) / 2 - 1 and len(arr) / 2.
3. Calculate the difference between the occurrence of the middle element and the half of the array length.
4. Return the minimum of the differences for all elements in the array.

Here's a step-by-step walkthrough of the solution:

1. Sort the given array:
   arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9]

2. Find the middle element of the sorted array:
   middle = (len(arr) / 2) - 1 = 3
   Since len(arr) is odd, the middle element is the element at index 3, which is 4.

3. Calculate the difference between the occurrence of the middle element and the half of the array length:
   difference = abs(middle - len(arr) / 2) = abs(3 - 3) = 0

4. Return the minimum of the differences for all elements in the array:
   The minimum difference is 0, as calculated in step 3.

Here's an implementation of the solution in Go:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func SmallestChange(arr []int) int {
    length := len(arr)
    sortedArr := sortArray(arr)
    middle := (length / 2) - 1
    if length%2 != 0 {
        middle = length / 2
    }
    minDiff := 100000
    for _, v := range sortedArr {
        diff := abs(v - middle)
        if diff < minDiff {
            minDiff = diff
        }
    }
    return minDiff
}
```

This implementation calculates the smallest number of elements needed to be changed to make the array palindromic by finding the minimum difference between the occurrence of each element and the middle
