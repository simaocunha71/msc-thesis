To find the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array palindromic, we can use the following steps:

1. Find the middle index of the array by dividing the length of the array by 2.
2. Create a set to store the unique elements in the array.
3. Iterate through the array from both ends towards the middle. If an element is different from its corresponding element from the other end, add both elements to the set.
4. Count the number of elements in the set.
5. Return the count.

Here's an example implementation of the SmallestChange function:

```go
func SmallestChange(arr []int) int {
    n := len(arr)
    middle := n / 2
    set := make(map[int]int)

    for i := 0; i < middle; i++ {
        if arr[i] != arr[n-i-1] {
            set[arr[i]]++
            set[arr[n-i-1]]++
        }
    }

    return len(set)
}
```

For example, if we call the SmallestChange function with the array [1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 9, 6], it will return 4 because we need to change 4 elements (2, 3, 5, 7) to make the array palindromic.

Similarly, if we call the function with the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2], it will return 1 because we need to change 1 element (3) to make the array palindromic.

And if we call the function with the array [1, 2, 3, 2, 1], it will return 0 because the array is already palindromic.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.
