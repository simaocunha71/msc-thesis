Here's a solution in Python:

```python
def SmallestChange(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    left, right = 0, n-1
    count = 0

    while left < right:
        if arr[left] == arr[right]:
            left += 1
            right -= 1
        else:
            count += 1
            left += 1
            if arr[left] != arr[right]:
                count += 1
            right -= 1

    if left == right and arr[left] != arr[right]:
        count += 1

    return count
```

This solution uses a two-pointer approach to compare elements from the beginning and end of the array. It initializes a count variable to keep track of the number of changes needed. The left and right pointers start at the beginning and end of the array, respectively. The while loop continues until the left pointer is less than the right pointer.

Inside the loop, it checks if the elements at the left and right pointers are equal. If they are, it increments both pointers to move towards the center of the array. If the elements are not equal, it increments the count by 2 because two elements need to be changed to make the array palindromic.

After the loop, it checks if the left pointer is equal to the right pointer. If they are equal and the elements at those indices are not equal, it increments the count by 1 because one more change is needed to make the array palindromic.

Finally, it returns the count, which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array palindromic.

Overall, this solution has a time complexity of O(n) because it iterates through the array once using the two-pointer approach.
