Answer:
To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Initialize a counter variable `c` to 0. This variable will keep track of the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than `n` which are divisible by 11 or 13.

2. Use a `for` loop to iterate through all the multiples of 11 less than `n` (starting from 11). Inside the loop, check if the current multiple contains the digit 7 using the `strings.Count` function. If it does, increment the `c` counter by 1.

3. After the loop, use another `for` loop to iterate through all the multiples of 13 less than `n` (starting from 13). Inside this loop, check if the current multiple contains the digit 7 using the `strings.Count` function. If it does, increment the `c` counter by 1.

4. Finally, return the value of the `c` counter, which represents the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than `n` which are divisible by 11 or 13.

In the provided code example, the `FizzBuzz` function follows these steps to calculate the result. The `strconv.Itoa` function is used to convert the integer `i` to a string, and then the `strings.Count` function is used to count the occurrences of the digit 7 in the string representation of `i`.

To test the function, you can use the `>>>>` operator followed by the function name and the desired input value. For example, `>>>> FizzBuzz(50)` will output `0
