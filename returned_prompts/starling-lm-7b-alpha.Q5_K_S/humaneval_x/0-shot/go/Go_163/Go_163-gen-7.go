func GenerateIntegers(a, b int) []int {
    var result []int
    for i := a; i <= b; i++ {
        digits := fmt.Sprintf("%d", i)
        for _, d := range digits {
            if d%2 == 0 {
                result = append(result, i)
            }
        }
    }
    return result
}

In this solution, we generate all the digits between a and b. Then, for each digit, we check if it is even. If it is, we add the corresponding number to the result slice.

The function uses a for loop to iterate over all the numbers between a and b. The digits of each number are obtained using the fmt.Sprintf("%d", i) function. Then, for each digit, we check if it is even by using the condition d%2 == 0. If the condition is true, we append the corresponding number to the result slice.

Finally, the function returns the result slice containing all the even digits between a and b, in ascending order.

This solution is efficient as it only iterates over the numbers between a and b once, checking the evenness of each digit as it goes.

Here are some test cases to validate the solution:

Test Case 1:
GenerateIntegers(2, 8) => [2, 4, 6, 8]
Explanation: The even digits between 2 and 8 are 2, 4, 6, and 8. The function correctly returns these digits in ascending order.

Test Case 2:
GenerateIntegers(8, 2) => [2, 4, 6, 8]
Explanation: The even digits between 8 and 2 are the same as in the previous test case. The function correctly returns these digits in ascending order.

Test Case 3:
GenerateIntegers(10, 14) => []
Explanation: There are no even digits between 10 and 14. The function correctly returns an empty slice.

Test Case 4:
GenerateIntegers(20, 25) => [20, 22, 24, 2
