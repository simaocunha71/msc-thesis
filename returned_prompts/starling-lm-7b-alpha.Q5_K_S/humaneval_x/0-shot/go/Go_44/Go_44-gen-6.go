    result := ""
    for x > 0 {
        result = strconv.Itoa(x%base) + result
        x /= base
    }
    return result
}

Answer:
To convert a number from one base to another, you can follow these steps:

1. Initialize a result string to store the converted number.
2. Use a while loop to iterate through the number until it becomes 0.
3. In each iteration, get the remainder of the number when divided by the new base. Use the strconv.Itoa() function to convert the remainder to a string and add it to the beginning of the result string.
4. Divide the number by the new base and continue to the next iteration.
5. After the loop is finished, return the result string.

By following these steps, you can convert a number from one base to another and return the converted number as a string.

Here is an example implementation of the ChangeBase function in Go:

```go
import (
    "strconv"
)

func ChangeBase(x int, base int) string {
    result := ""
    for x > 0 {
        result = strconv.Itoa(x%base) + result
        x /= base
    }
    return result
}
```

To test the function, you can use the provided test cases:

```go
fmt.Println(ChangeBase(8, 3)) // Output: '22'
fmt.Println(ChangeBase(8, 2)) // Output: '1000'
fmt.Println(ChangeBase(7, 2)) // Output: '111'
```

These test cases demonstrate how to convert a number from base 8 to base 3, base 8 to base 2, and base 7 to base 2, respectively. The expected output is shown in the comments next to each test case.

By following this approach, you can successfully convert a number from one base to another using the provided ChangeBase function in Go.

Here are some additional notes about the code:

- The ChangeBase function takes two parameters: x (the number to be converted) and base (the new base to convert the number to).
- Inside
