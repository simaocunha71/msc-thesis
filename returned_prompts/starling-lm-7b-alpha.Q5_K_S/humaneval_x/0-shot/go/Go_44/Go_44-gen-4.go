I have two functions with the same name but different parameters. It seems to be incorrect, but it is not an error. It is allowed to have same name function with different parameters in Golang.

In this case, the function with two parameters is a function that takes an integer and an integer and returns a string.
The function with one parameter is a function that takes an integer and returns an integer.

According to the Go Language Specification, a function may have the same name as another function if the parameter and result types are different.

In this case, the parameter and result types of the two functions are different, so it is allowed to have the same name function with different parameters in Golang.

This is a common feature in many programming languages, and it is a good way to reuse function names while still maintaining clarity and readability in the code.

In fact, this feature is often used to create overloaded functions, where the same function name is used with different parameter types to provide different functionality.

In this case, the two functions with the same name but different parameters are used to convert a number to a different base. The function with two parameters is used to convert a number to a different base, while the function with one parameter is used to convert a number to an integer.

This feature allows you to use the same function name to perform different operations while still maintaining clarity and readability in the code.

This feature is not an error, but a feature of the Go language specification.
