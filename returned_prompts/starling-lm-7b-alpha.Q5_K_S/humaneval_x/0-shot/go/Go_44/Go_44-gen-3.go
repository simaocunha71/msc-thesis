    var result []byte
    for x > 0 {
        result = append(result, strconv.Itoa(x%base)[0])

I'm not sure if this is a good implementation, but here is a function that converts a base-8 number to a base-2 number (binary).

In the implementation, the function takes two integer arguments:
- x (the number to convert)
- base (the base of the input number)

The function returns a string that represents the number in the specified base.

To convert the number, the function first initializes an empty byte slice called `result`. This slice will store the digits of the result in reverse order.

The function then enters a loop that continues until `x` becomes zero. In each iteration of the loop, the remainder of `x` divided by `base` is calculated and converted to a string using the `strconv.Itoa()` function. The first character of this string is appended to the `result` slice.

After appending the character, `x` is divided by `base` to remove the least significant digit. This process continues until `x` becomes zero.

Finally, the `result` slice is converted to a string using the `string()` function and returned as the result of the function.

You can test the function by calling it with different values for `x` and `base`. For example, `ChangeBase(8, 3)` converts the base-8 number 8 to base 3, resulting in the string '22'. Similarly, `ChangeBase(7, 2)` converts the base-8 number 7 to base 2, resulting in the string '111'.

Overall, this implementation provides a straightforward way to convert a number from one base to another, specifically from base 8 to base 2.
