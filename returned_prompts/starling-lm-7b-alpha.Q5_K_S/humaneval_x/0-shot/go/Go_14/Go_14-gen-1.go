To get all the prefixes of a string, you can iterate through each character in the string and append the current substring to a slice. Here is a solution in Go:

```go
func AllPrefixes(str string) []string {
    prefixes := []string{}
    for i := 0; i < len(str); i++ {
        prefixes = append(prefixes, str[:i+1])
    }
    return prefixes
}
```

This function initializes an empty slice called `prefixes`. It then uses a for loop to iterate through each character in the input string. At each iteration, it appends a new substring to the `prefixes` slice. The substring is created by slicing the input string from the beginning to the current index plus one. Finally, it returns the `prefixes` slice containing all the prefixes of the input string.

You can use this function to get all the prefixes of a string by calling it with the desired string as an argument. For example, if you call `AllPrefixes("abc")`, it will return `["a", "ab", "abc"]`.

Note that the order of the prefixes in the returned slice is from shortest to longest, as specified in the problem description.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println(AllPrefixes("abc")) // ["a", "ab", "abc"]
}
```

This code demonstrates how to use the `AllPrefixes` function. It defines a `main` function that calls `AllPrefixes("abc")` and prints the returned slice. The output will be `["a", "ab", "abc"]`, which are all the prefixes of the input string "abc" in the order from shortest to longest.

```python
def all_prefixes(s):
    prefixes = []
    for i in range(len(s)):
        prefixes.append(s[:i+1])
    return prefixes

print(all_prefixes("abc")) # ["a", "ab", "abc"]
```

This code demonstrates how to use the `all_prefixes` function in Python. It defines a function called `all_prefixes`
