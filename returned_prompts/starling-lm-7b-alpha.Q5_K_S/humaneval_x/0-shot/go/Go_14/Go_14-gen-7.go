To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Initialize an empty slice of strings to store the prefixes.
2. Iterate through the input string from the first character to the end.
3. For each character, append the current substring to the prefixes slice.
4. Return the prefixes slice.

Here's a sample implementation of the AllPrefixes function in Go:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func AllPrefixes(str string) []string {
    prefixes := []string{}
    for i := 0; i < len(str); i++ {
        prefixes = append(prefixes, str[:i+1])
    }
    return prefixes
}
```

You can test the function with the example you provided:

```go
fmt.Println(AllPrefixes("abc")) // Output: ['a' 'ab' 'abc']
```

This will print the list of all prefixes from shortest to longest of the input string "abc".
