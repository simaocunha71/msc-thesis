The AllPrefixes function will return a list of all prefixes of a given string from shortest to longest.

Here's an example of how it works:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func AllPrefixes(str string) []string {
    var res []string
    for i := 0; i < len(str); i++ {
        prefix := str[:i+1]
        res = append(res, prefix)
    }
    return res
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(AllPrefixes("abc")) // Output: ['a' 'ab' 'abc']
}
```

In this solution, we create an empty slice called `res` to store the prefixes. We then loop through the string `str` using a for loop. For each iteration, we create a new prefix by slicing the string from index 0 to the current index `i+1`. We append this prefix to the `res` slice. Finally, we return the `res` slice containing all the prefixes.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because we iterate through the string exactly once. The space complexity is also O(n) since we store all the prefixes in a slice.

Overall, this solution provides an efficient way to find all the prefixes of a given string and returns them in the desired order.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The function `AllPrefixes` takes a string `str` as input.
2. We create an empty slice called `res` to store the prefixes.
3. We use a for loop to iterate through the string `str` from index 0 to the length of the string.
4. Inside the loop, we create a new prefix by slicing the string from index 0 to the current index `i+1`.
5. We append this prefix to the `res` slice using the `append` function.
6. After the loop, we return the `res` slice containing all the prefixes.
7. In the `main` function, we call the `AllPrefixes` function with the string "abc" as an argument and print the result, which is `['a' 'ab'
