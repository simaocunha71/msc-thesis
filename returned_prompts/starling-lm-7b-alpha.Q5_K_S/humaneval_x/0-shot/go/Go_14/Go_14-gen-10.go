Here's a Go solution:

```go
func AllPrefixes(str string) []string {
    var result []string
    for i := 0; i < len(str); i++ {
        result = append(result, str[:i+1])
    }
    return result
}
```

And here's a Python solution:

```python
def AllPrefixes(str):
    return [str[i:] for i in range(len(str))]
```

These functions both return a list of all prefixes from shortest to longest of the input string.

For example, if you call `AllPrefixes("abc")`, it will return `['a', 'ab', 'abc']`.

Both solutions use a loop to iterate over the characters of the string. In the Go solution, we use a `for` loop to create a new slice for each prefix. In the Python solution, we use a list comprehension to create a new slice for each prefix.

The Go solution appends each prefix to the result slice using the `append` function. The Python solution uses slicing to create a new slice for each prefix and adds them to the result list.

Both solutions return the result list of all prefixes from shortest to longest.

The time complexity of both solutions is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because both solutions iterate over the characters of the string once. The space complexity of both solutions is also O(n), as they both create a new slice for each prefix.

In summary, the Go solution is a simple and efficient way to find all prefixes from shortest to longest of an input string. The Python solution is also a straightforward approach, but it's important to note that slicing in Python can be slower than using the `append` function.

Overall, both solutions are effective and provide a list of all prefixes from shortest to longest of the input string.

```go
func AllPrefixes(str string) []string {
    var result []string
    for i := 0; i < len(str); i++ {
        result = append(result, str[:i+1])
    }
    return result
}
```

```python
