    // First, if n is 1, then there is only one 1-digit positive integer that starts or ends with 1.
    if n == 1 {
        return 1
    }

    // Then, if n is 2, there are two 2-digit positive integers that start or end with 1, 10 and 11.
    if n == 2 {
        return 2
    }

    // If n > 2, we can start at the first digit, which has 9 options (1-9)
    // Then, we can start at the second digit, which also has 9 options (0-9 - 1, since it cannot end with 1).
    // Then, the remaining (n-2) digits have 10 options each.
    return 9*9*math.Pow(10, float64(n-2))

Answer:

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. If n is 1, then there is only one 1-digit positive integer that starts or ends with 1, which is 1 itself.
2. If n is 2, there are two 2-digit positive integers that start or end with 1, 10 and 11.
3. If n > 2, we can start at the first digit, which has 9 options (1-9), as 0 cannot be the first digit.
4. Then, we can start at the second digit, which also has 9 options (0-9 - 1), as it cannot end with 1.
5. Then, the remaining (n-2) digits have 10 options each, as they can be any digit from 0 to 9.
6. Multiplying all these options together gives us the total count of the numbers of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1.

In the given code, the StartsOneEnds function implements this logic. It first checks if n is 1 or 2, and returns the corresponding result. If n is greater than 2, it multiplies 9 by itself, then multiplies the result by 9, and finally multiplies the result by
