    if n == 0 {
        return 1
    }
    return 9 * math.Pow(10, float64(n-1)) + 1
}

Answer:
Here's a possible solution:

The total number of n-digit positive integers is 9*10^(n-1), since the first digit cannot be 0.

If the first digit is not 1, then the rest of the digits can be any of the 9 nonzero digits, and the last digit can be any of the 10 digits. This accounts for 9*10^(n-1) cases.

If the first digit is 1, then the last digit must be 1, and the rest of the digits can be any of the 9 nonzero digits. This accounts for an additional 9 cases.

Therefore, the total number of integers starting or ending with 1 is 9*10^(n-1) + 9.

Here is a Go program that implements this logic:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "math"
)

func StartsOneEnds(n int) int {
    if n == 0 {
        return 1
    }
    return 9*int(math.Pow(10, float64(n-1))) + 9
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(StartsOneEnds(3)) // 909
}
```

This code defines the function `StartsOneEnds` which calculates the number of n-digit integers starting or ending with 1. The function first checks if n is 0, in which case there is only one integer (0). Otherwise, it calculates the number of integers starting with a non-1 digit and the number of integers starting with a 1 digit, and adds them together. The result is printed out in the `main` function.

The output of this program is `909`, which is the number of 3-digit integers that start or end with 1.

This solution correctly handles the edge case of `n = 0` and accurately calculates the number
