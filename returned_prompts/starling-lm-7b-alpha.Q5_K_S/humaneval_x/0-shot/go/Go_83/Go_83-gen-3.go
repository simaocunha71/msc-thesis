The function StartsOneEnds takes an integer as a parameter and returns the count of the numbers of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1. The function uses recursion to calculate the result.

To solve this problem, we can break it down into two cases:

1. The number starts with 1: In this case, we have one option for the first digit (1), and we can choose any of the remaining (n-1) digits to be any of the 10 available digits (0-9). So, the count of numbers starting with 1 is 1 * 10^(n-1).

2. The number ends with 1: In this case, we have one option for the last digit (1), and we can choose any of the n-1 remaining digits to be any of the 10 available digits (0-9). So, the count of numbers ending with 1 is 1 * 10^(n-1).

Adding the counts from both cases, we get the total count of numbers that start or end with 1: (n-1) + 9*math.Pow(10, (n-1)).

For example, if n = 3, the function returns 8, because there are 8 three-digit positive integers that start or end with 1: 100, 101, 102, ..., 198, 199.

To handle edge cases, the function checks if n is 0 or 1 and returns 0 or 1 respectively.

Overall, the function StartsOneEnds provides a recursive solution to calculate the count of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1.
