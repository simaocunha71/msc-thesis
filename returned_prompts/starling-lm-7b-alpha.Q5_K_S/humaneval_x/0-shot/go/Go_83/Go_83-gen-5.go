Answer:

To solve this problem, you can use the following steps:

1. Initialize a variable, `res`, to store the result.
2. Initialize a variable, `limit`, to store the maximum value of an `n`-digit number. The `limit` can be calculated by raising 10 to the power of `n`. For example, if `n` is 3, the `limit` would be 999.
3. Iterate through all the numbers from 1 to `limit`. For each number, check if the number is divisible by `limit` (i.e., if the number ends with 1). If it is divisible, add `limit` - the remainder of the number divided by `limit` + 1 to `res`. If it is not divisible, add 1 to `res`.
4. Return the value of `res`.

In the provided code, the `StartsOneEnds` function follows these steps to calculate the count of `n`-digit positive integers that start or end with 1.

To optimize the performance of this function, you can use the following approach:

1. Instead of iterating through all the numbers from 1 to `limit`, you can iterate through all the numbers from 1 to `limit` divided by 10. This is because the numbers that start or end with 1 can only have a single digit in the units place (i.e., 1, 10, 100, ...). For example, if `n` is 3, you only need to consider the numbers 1, 10, 100, and 1000, instead of 1 to 999.
2. For each number, you can directly check if it is divisible by 10, and add the result to `res`. This eliminates
