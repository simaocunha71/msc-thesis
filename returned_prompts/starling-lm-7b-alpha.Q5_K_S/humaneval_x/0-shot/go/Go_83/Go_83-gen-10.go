The StartsOneEnds function takes an integer n and returns the number of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1.

In the for loop, we iterate through the digits of the number from left to right (from the most significant digit to the least significant digit). For each digit, we calculate the number of choices for that digit. Since the first digit can be any of the 9 digits from 1 to 9, we have 9 choices. For the second digit, since it cannot be 0, we have 9 choices, and so on. 

To calculate the number of choices for each digit, we use the formula n! / (n-k)!, where n is the total number of digits and k is the position of the digit. In our case, k starts from 1, so we can simplify the formula to n! / (n-k)! = 9^(n-k). 

Finally, we sum up the number of choices for all the digits to get the total number of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1.

For example, if n = 3, the function will return 9 + 9*9 + 9*9*9 = 9 + 81 + 729 = 829.

In the given solution, the StartsOneEnds function is implemented in Go. The function uses a for loop to calculate the number of choices for each digit. It multiplies the number of choices for each digit to get the total number of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1.

The time complexity of the function is O(n), as it only iterates through the digits of the number. The space complexity is O(1), as it only uses a single integer variable to store the result.

To test the function, you can use the provided code. It calls the StartsOneEnds function with different values of n and prints the result. For example, if you run the code, you will see the following output:
