func LargestPrimeFactor(n int) int {
    // Use a loop to divide n by the largest possible factor
    // until n is 1 or a prime number.
    for i := 2; i <= n/i; i++ {
        // Check if i is a factor of n. If so, divide n by i
        // and repeat the process until i is no longer a factor.
        for n % i == 0 {
            n /= i

    return n
}

In this code, the function LargestPrimeFactor takes an integer n as input and returns the largest prime factor of n. The function uses a loop to divide n by the largest possible factor until n is 1 or a prime number. The loop starts from 2 and goes up to n/i, where i is the current factor. Inside the loop, there is another loop that checks if i is a factor of n. If so, n is divided by i and the process is repeated until i is no longer a factor. Finally, the function returns the value of n, which is the largest prime factor of the original input number.

For example, if we call LargestPrimeFactor(13195), the function will return 29, as 29 is the largest prime factor of 13195. Similarly, if we call LargestPrimeFactor(2048), the function will return 2, as 2 is the largest prime factor of 2048.

This function can be useful in various scenarios where we need to find the largest prime factor of a given number.

Note: It's important to note that the function assumes that n is greater than 1 and is not a prime number itself. If n is a prime number, the function will return n itself, as there are no factors other than 1 and the number itself for prime numbers.

Here are some additional notes regarding the code:

- The outer loop starts from 2 and goes up to n/i, as i is the current factor. This ensures that we don't go beyond the maximum possible factor of n in each iteration.
- The inner loop checks if i is a factor of n. If n % i == 0, it means that i is a factor of n. In such
