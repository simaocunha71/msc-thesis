func LargestPrimeFactor(n int) int {
    i := 2
    for {
        if n%i == 0 {
            n /= i
        } else {
            i++

This function uses the method of repeatedly dividing by the smallest prime factor until the number is reduced to a single prime factor, then returns that factor.

It's important to note that the function does not verify if the input number is a prime. For prime numbers, the function will return 1.

Here are some test cases to check the function's performance:

>>> LargestPrimeFactor(13195)
29
>>> LargestPrimeFactor(2048)
2
