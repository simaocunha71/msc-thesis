To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Initialize a variable to store the largest prime factor found so far, initially set to 2 (as 2 is the smallest prime number).
2. Use a while loop to repeatedly divide the number by the largest prime factor found, until it can no longer be divided.
3. Inside the loop, update the largest prime factor variable to the result of dividing n by the previous largest prime factor.
4. After the loop, return the largest prime factor.

Here's a Python implementation of the above algorithm:

```python
def LargestPrimeFactor(n):
    largest_prime_factor = 2
    while n % largest_prime_factor != 0:
        largest_prime_factor += 1
    return largest_prime_factor
```

For example, when you call `LargestPrimeFactor(13195)`, the function will repeatedly divide 13195 by the largest prime factor found, starting from 2. Since 13195 is divisible by 3, the largest prime factor will be updated to 3. Then, 13195 is not divisible by 4, so the function will continue to the next largest prime factor, 5, and so on. Eventually, it will find that 13195 is divisible by 29, and the function will return 29 as the largest prime factor of 13195.

You can test this function with the provided input `LargestPrimeFactor(13195)` and `LargestPrimeFactor(2048)` to verify that it works correctly.

```python
print(LargestPrimeFactor(13195))  # Output: 29
print(LargestPrimeFactor(2048))  # Output: 2
```

The output will be `29` for the first input and `2` for the second input, as expected.

```python
def LargestPrimeFactor(n):
    largest_prime_factor = 2
    while n % largest_prime_factor != 0:
        largest_prime_factor += 1
    return largest
