To find the largest prime factor of a given number, you can follow this algorithm:

1. Initialize a variable "largestPrime" with the value of the given number "n".
2. Start a loop that runs until "n" becomes 1. In each iteration of the loop, find the largest prime factor of "n" and update the value of "largestPrime" accordingly.
3. To find the largest prime factor of a number, you can use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm or any other prime-finding algorithm. The algorithm should return the largest prime factor found.
4. Once the loop finishes, return the value of "largestPrime".

Here's an example implementation of the algorithm in Go:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func LargestPrimeFactor(n int) int {
    largestPrime := n

    for n > 1 {
        // Find the largest prime factor of n
        // This step can be implemented using any prime-finding algorithm
        largestPrime = largestPrimeFactor(n)

        // Divide n by the largest prime factor
        n /= largestPrime
    }

    return largestPrime
}

func largestPrimeFactor(n int) int {
    // Implementation of the prime-finding algorithm
    // This step can be implemented using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm or any other prime-finding algorithm
    // The algorithm should return the largest prime factor found
    // ...
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(LargestPrimeFactor(13195)) // Output: 29
    fmt.Println(LargestPrimeFactor(2048))  // Output: 2
}
```
