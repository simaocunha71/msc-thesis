To solve this problem, you can use a binary search algorithm to find the largest prime factor of a given number. Here's a step-by-step guide to solving this problem:

1. First, you need to define a helper function called "isPrime" that checks whether a given number is a prime number. This function should return a boolean value: true if the number is prime, and false otherwise. Here's a simple implementation of this function:

```go
func isPrime(n int) bool {
    if n <= 1 {
        return false
    }
    for i := 2; i * i <= n; i++ {
        if n % i == 0 {
            return false
        }
    }
    return true
}
```

2. Next, you can use a binary search algorithm to find the largest prime factor of the given number. This algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the number by 2 until it becomes odd, and then dividing it by the largest prime number less than or equal to the number until it becomes even. Here's a simple implementation of this algorithm:

```go
func LargestPrimeFactor(n int) int {
    if !isPrime(n) {
        for n % 2 == 0 {
            n /= 2
        }
        for i := 3; i * i <= n; i += 2 {
            if n % i == 0 {
                n /= i
            }
        }
    }
    return n
}
```

3. Finally, you can call the "LargestPrimeFactor" function with a test number and print the result:

```go
fmt.Println(LargestPrimeFactor(13195)) // Output: 29
fmt.Println(LargestPrimeFactor(2048))  // Output: 2
```

This solution will return the largest prime factor of the given number.

In the provided code, the "isPrime" function checks whether a given number is prime by checking if it is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of the number. If the number is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime.
