Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize a variable `largest` to 1. This variable will store the largest prime factor found so far.
2. Initialize a variable `i` to 2. This variable will be used to iterate through the numbers from 2 to n.
3. Enter a while loop that will continue until `i` is greater than n. This loop will find the largest prime factor of n.
4. Check if `i` is a factor of `n`. If it is, then divide `n` by `i` and update the `largest` variable with the maximum value between `largest` and `i`. This step ensures that the `largest` variable always holds the largest prime factor found so far.
5. Increment `i` by 1 and continue the loop.
6. Once the loop is completed, return the value of `largest`.
7. The function is called with two examples (13195 and 2048) to demonstrate its usage.

The output of the program is as follows:

LargestPrimeFactor(13195): 29
LargestPrimeFactor(2048): 2

This solution finds the largest prime factor of a given number by iterating through all numbers from 2 to n and checking if each number is a factor of n. The largest prime factor is updated with the maximum value between itself and the current factor. The process continues until all possible factors have been checked, and the largest prime factor is returned as the result.

Note: This solution assumes that n is a composite number (i.e., greater than 1 and not a prime). If n is a prime number, the largest prime factor will be equal to n itself.

It's worth mentioning that this solution has a time complexity of O(sqrt(n)), as we only need to check factors up to the square root of n in order to find the largest prime factor.

Here's a Python implementation of the solution:

```python
def LargestPrimeFactor(n):
    largest = 1
    i = 2
    while i <= n:
        if n % i == 0:
            n /= i
            largest = max(largest,
