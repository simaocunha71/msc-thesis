The code you are trying to use is incorrect. It is missing a return statement, which is necessary to return a value from the function. Here's a corrected version of the function that should work:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func HowManyTimes(str string, substring string) int {
    count := 0
    for i := 0; i < len(str)-len(substring)+1; i++ {
        if str[i:i+len(substring)] == substring {
            count++
        }
    }
    return count
}
```

With this updated function, you can use it to find the number of times a given substring can be found in the original string, including overlapping cases. For example:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println(HowManyTimes("", "a"))  // 0
    fmt.Println(HowManyTimes("aaa", "a"))  // 3
    fmt.Println(HowManyTimes("aaaa", "aa"))  // 3
}
```

The `HowManyTimes` function uses a for loop to iterate through each possible starting position of the substring in the original string. It then compares the substring starting at that position with the given substring. If they match, the count variable is incremented. Finally, the function returns the total count of matching substrings found in the original string.

In the provided example, the `HowManyTimes` function is called with different inputs to demonstrate its usage. The first call returns 0 because the substring "a" cannot be found in an empty string. The second call returns 3 because the substring "a" can be found three times in the string "aaa". The third call returns 3 because the substring "aa" can be found three times in the string "aaaa".

I hope this helps you understand how to correctly use the `HowManyTimes` function and apply it to find the number of times a given substring can be found in the original string, including overlapping cases. Let me know if you have any more questions!

```go
package main

import (
