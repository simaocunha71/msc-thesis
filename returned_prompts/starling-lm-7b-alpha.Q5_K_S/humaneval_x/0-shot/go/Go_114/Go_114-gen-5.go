    min := math.MaxInt32
    var sum int
    for i := 0; i < len(nums); i++ {
        sum = 0
        for j := i; j < len(nums); j++ {
            sum += nums[j]
            if sum < min {
                min = sum
            }
        }
    }
    return min
}





I have a question about this code, in the for loop:
sum = 0
for j := i; j < len(nums); j++ {
    sum += nums[j]
    if sum < min {
        min = sum
    }
}

Why do we need to set sum to 0 every time before the for loop start to calculate the minimum sum of the subarray?

Answer:

Without initializing sum to zero, the first time through the loop, sum would be the total of the first n numbers in the array, where n is the index of the outer loop. This is because, in the inner loop, the first time through, sum would be the total of the first n+1 numbers in the array, where n is the index of the outer loop.

By initializing sum to zero, you start with the sum of the first number in the array, which is what you want.

Here's a different way of approaching the problem that doesn't require initializing sum to zero:

```go
func Minsubarraysum(nums []int) int {
    min := math.MaxInt32
    for i := 0; i < len(nums); i++ {
        sum := 0
        for j := i; j < len(nums); j++ {
            sum += nums[j]
            if sum < min {
                min = sum
            }
        }
    }
    return min
}
```

In this version, the sum variable is declared inside the outer loop, so it is reset to zero every time the outer loop iterates.

Here's another approach that doesn't require initializing sum to zero, but requires a little more code:

```go
func Minsubarraysum(nums []int) int {
