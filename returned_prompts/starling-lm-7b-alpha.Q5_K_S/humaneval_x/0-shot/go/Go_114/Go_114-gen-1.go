Answer:
The time complexity of the function is O(n) and space complexity is O(1).

Explanation:
The function Minsubarraysum takes an array of integers nums as input and returns the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array of nums.

The function initializes a variable ans to the maximum possible integer value, and a variable cur to 0. It then iterates over the input array using a for loop. For each element in the array, it adds the element to the current sum cur. If the current sum becomes greater than 0, it means that adding the current element to the sub-array would result in a negative sum, so the current sum is reset to the value of the current element. If the current sum is less than the current minimum sum (ans), the current sum becomes the new minimum sum. Finally, the function returns the minimum sum.

The time complexity of the function is O(n) because it iterates over the input array once. The space complexity is O(1) because no additional memory is used beyond the input array and the variables ans and cur, which are both of fixed size.

Overall, the function provides a solution to finding the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array of an input array of integers, with a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1).

Here is an example usage of the function:
```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    nums := []int{2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4}
    result := Minsubarraysum(nums)
    fmt.Println(result) // Output: 1
}
```

In this example, the function Minsubarraysum is called with the input array `[2, 3, 4, 1,
