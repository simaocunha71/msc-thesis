func BelowThreshold(l []int,t int) bool {
    for _, v := range l {
        if v > t {
            return false
        }
    }
    return true
}

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Define a function called BelowThreshold that takes in two parameters: l, which is a slice of integers, and t, which is an integer representing the threshold.
2. Initialize a boolean variable called result with the value true. This variable will be used to store the result of the function.
3. Use a for range loop to iterate through each element, v, in the slice l. The range keyword is used to loop over the values in the slice.
4. Inside the loop, check if the current element, v, is greater than the threshold, t. If it is, return false immediately, as this means that not all numbers in the list are below the threshold.
5. After the loop, if the function has not returned false yet, it means that all numbers in the list are below the threshold. In this case, return true.
6. Outside the function, call the BelowThreshold function with a sample list of integers, [1, 2, 4, 10], and a threshold value of 100. This will test if all numbers in the list are below the threshold. The function will return true, indicating that they are.
7. Call the BelowThreshold function again with a different list of integers, [1, 20, 4, 10], and a threshold value of 5. This will test if all numbers in the list are below the threshold. The function will return false, indicating that they are not.

Overall, the solution defines a function that checks if all numbers in a list are below a given threshold. It then demonstrates the usage of the function with two sample inputs and prints the results.
