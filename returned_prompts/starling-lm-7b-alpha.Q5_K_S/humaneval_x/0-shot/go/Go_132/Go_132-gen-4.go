Here's one approach to solve this problem:

1. Initialize an integer `left` to keep track of the number of left square brackets encountered.
2. Initialize an integer `right` to keep track of the number of right square brackets encountered.
3. Traverse the input string `s`.
4. If a left bracket is encountered, increment `left`.
5. If a right bracket is encountered, increment `right`.
6. If `left > 0 && right > 0`, return true. This means that at least one left bracket is nested.
7. If `left == 0 && right != 0`, return false. This means that there are more right brackets than left brackets.
8. If `right == 0 && left != 0`, return false. This means that there are more left brackets than right brackets.
9. If `left == 0 && right == 0`, return false. This means that there are no brackets at all.

Here's the code:

```go
func IsNested(s string) bool {
    left, right := 0, 0
    for _, r := range s {
        if r == '[' {
            left++
        } else if r == ']' {
            right++
        }
        if left > 0 && right > 0 {
            return true
        }
    }
    return left == 0 && right != 0 || left != 0 && right == 0
}
```

In this code, the `range` keyword is used to iterate over each rune (character) in the string `s`. The `r` variable takes on the value of each character in the string. The `range` keyword is used instead of a for loop because strings in Go are immutable, and using `range` allows us to iterate over the string without modifying it.

The `IsNested` function returns true if there is at least one left bracket that is nested, and false otherwise.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.
