Here's a solution that uses a stack to solve this problem:

```go
func IsNested(s string) bool {
    stack := []rune{}
    for _, r := range s {
        if r == '[' {
            stack = append(stack, r)
        } else if r == ']' {
            if len(stack) > 0 && stack[len(stack)-1] == '[' {
                stack = stack[:len(stack)-1]
            } else {
                return false
            }
        }
    }
    return len(stack) == 0
}
```

This function first initializes an empty stack, which is a slice of runes. We use a slice of runes instead of a slice of bytes to handle Unicode characters correctly.

Then we iterate over the input string. If we encounter an opening bracket (`[`), we push it onto the stack. If we encounter a closing bracket (`]`), we check if the stack is not empty and if the last element of the stack is an opening bracket. If these conditions are met, we remove the last element from the stack. If not, we return false, as this means that there is no valid subsequence of brackets that are nested.

Finally, after iterating over all characters in the input string, we check if the stack is empty. If it is, this means that all opening brackets have been matched with closing brackets and there are no unpaired opening brackets left. In this case, we return true. Otherwise, we return false, as this means that there are unpaired opening brackets left in the input string.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, as we iterate over the string once. The space complexity is also O(n), as the size of the stack can grow up to n in the worst case scenario (if all characters in the input string are opening brackets).

func IsNested(s string) bool {
    stack := []rune{}
    for _, r := range s {
        if r == '[' {
            stack = append(stack, r)
        } else
