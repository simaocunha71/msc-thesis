To solve this problem, we can use a stack to keep track of opening brackets we encounter.
We will iterate through each character in the string and for each opening bracket, we will push it onto the stack.
For each closing bracket, we will check if the stack is empty or if the closing bracket does not match the top of the stack.
If the stack is empty or the brackets don't match, we will return false as this indicates that there is no valid subsequence of brackets.
If we iterate through all the characters in the string and we still have opening brackets left on the stack, we can conclude that there is at least one valid subsequence of brackets with nested brackets.
In this case, we will return true.

Here is the implementation in Go:

```go
func IsNested(s string) bool {
    stack := []rune{}
    for _, r := range s {
        if r == '[' {
            stack = append(stack, r)
        } else if r == ']' {
            if len(stack) == 0 {
                return false
            }
            if stack[len(stack)-1] != '[' {
                return false
            }
            stack = stack[:len(stack)-1]
        }
    }
    return len(stack) > 0
}
```

This implementation has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string.

Here are some test cases to validate the implementation:

```go
fmt.Println(IsNested("[]"))  // false
fmt.Println(IsNested("[[]]"))  // true
fmt.Println(IsNested("[]]]]]]][[[[[]"))  // false
fmt.Println(IsNested("[][]"))  // false
fmt.Println(IsNested("[][]"))  // false
fmt.Println(IsNested("[[][]]"))  // true
fmt.Println(IsNested("[[]][[["))  // true
```
