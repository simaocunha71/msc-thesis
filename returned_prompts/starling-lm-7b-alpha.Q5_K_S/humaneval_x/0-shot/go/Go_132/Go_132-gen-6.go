To determine if there are at least one bracket in the subsequence that is nested, we can count the number of opening brackets and closing brackets.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize two variables, `openCount` and `closeCount`, to keep track of the number of opening and closing brackets, respectively.
2. Iterate through the input string from start to end. If an opening bracket is encountered, increment the `openCount` by 1. If a closing bracket is encountered, increment the `closeCount` by 1.
3. After iterating through the entire string, check if `openCount` is greater than `closeCount`. If `openCount` is greater than `closeCount`, it means that there are at least one bracket in the subsequence that is nested. Return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

Here is the code:
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func IsNested(s string) bool {
  openCount, closeCount := 0, 0
  for _, r := range s {
    if r == '[' {
      openCount++
    } else if r == ']' {
      closeCount++
    }
  }
  return openCount > closeCount
}
```

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of additional space.

You can use this function to check if a subsequence of brackets in a given string is nested. For example, `IsNested('[[]]')` returns `true`, `IsNested('[]]]]]]][[[[[]')` returns `false`, `IsNested('[][]')` returns `false`, `IsNested('[]')` returns `false`, and `IsNested('[[][]]')` returns `true`.

```go
func main() {
  fmt.Println(IsNested("[]"))
  fmt.Println(IsNested("[][]"))
  fmt.Println(IsNested("[][][]"))
  fmt.Println(IsNested("[][][][][][][][]
