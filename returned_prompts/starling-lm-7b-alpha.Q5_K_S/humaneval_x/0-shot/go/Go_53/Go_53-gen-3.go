To solve this problem, you can use the following solution:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func Add(x int, y int) int {
    return x + y
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(Add(2, 3))
    fmt.Println(Add(5, 7))
}
```

This code defines a function `Add` that takes two integer arguments `x` and `y` and returns their sum. The `main` function then calls this function with different arguments and prints the results.

When you run this program, it will output:

```
5
12
```

This confirms that the `Add` function is correctly adding the two input values.

Note that the `fmt.Println` function is used to print the results of the addition to the console. You can modify this code to print the results in a different format or to a different location, depending on your needs.

Overall, this solution demonstrates a simple way to add two numbers in Go using a custom function.

Here's the code again for reference:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func Add(x int, y int) int {
    return x + y
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(Add(2, 3))
    fmt.Println(Add(5, 7))
}
```

Answer:

To solve this problem, you can define a function called `Add` that takes two integer arguments `x` and `y` and returns their sum. Here's an example of how you can implement this in Go:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func Add(x int, y int) int {
    return x + y
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(Add(2, 3))
    fmt.Println(Add(5, 7))
}
```

In this code, the `Add` function takes two integer arguments `x`
