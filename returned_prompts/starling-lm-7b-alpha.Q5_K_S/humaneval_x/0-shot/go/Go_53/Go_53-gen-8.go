In this Go program, the `Add` function is defined to take two integer parameters `x` and `y` and return their sum as an integer. The function uses the `+` operator to add the two numbers and returns the result. 

To use the `Add` function, you can call it with two integers as arguments, and it will return their sum. For example, `Add(2, 3)` will return `5` and `Add(5, 7)` will return `12`. 

Here's an example of how you can use the `Add` function in your Go program:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    result := Add(2, 3)
    fmt.Println(result) // Output: 5

    result = Add(5, 7)
    fmt.Println(result) // Output: 12
}
```

By calling the `Add` function with different integer values, you can perform addition operations in your Go program and obtain the desired results.

In the provided code, the `Add` function is defined as follows:

```go
func Add(x int, y int) int {
    return x + y
}
```

Here, the `Add` function takes two integer parameters `x` and `y` and returns their sum as an integer using the `+` operator. The function body consists of a single `return` statement that adds `x` and `y` together and returns the result.

You can call the `Add` function in your Go program like this:

```go
result := Add(2, 3)
fmt.Println(result) // Output: 5
```

This will call the `Add` function with the arguments `2` and `3`, and the returned value (`5`) will be assigned to the variable `result`. Finally, the `fmt.Println` function is used to display the value of `result` in the console.

You can use the `Add` function with different integer values to perform addition operations and obtain the desired results in your Go program.

In the provided code, the `Add` function is defined as follows:

```go
func Add(x int
