To solve this problem you can follow these steps:

1. Define a function named "Add" that takes two integer parameters, "x" and "y".
2. Inside the function, use the "+=" operator to add the values of "x" and "y".
3. Return the result of the addition.
4. Test the function by calling it with different input values and checking the returned output.

Here's an example implementation in Go:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func Add(x int, y int) int {
    sum := x + y
    return sum
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(Add(2, 3))      // Output: 5
    fmt.Println(Add(5, 7))      // Output: 12
}
```

In this code, the "Add" function takes two integer parameters, "x" and "y". It adds the values of "x" and "y" using the "+=" operator and stores the result in the "sum" variable. Finally, the function returns the value of "sum".

In the "main" function, we call the "Add" function with different input values (2 and 3, and 5 and 7) and print the returned output using the "fmt.Println" function.

When you run this program, it will output:

```
5
12
```

This confirms that the "Add" function correctly adds the input values and returns the sum.

You can modify the input values in the "main" function to test the function with different numbers.
