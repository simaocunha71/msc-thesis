To add two numbers x and y, you can use the following code:

```go
func Add(x int, y int) int {
    return x + y
}
```

This function takes two integer arguments `x` and `y`, and returns their sum. You can test the function by calling it with different inputs, like this:

```go
fmt.Println(Add(2, 3)) // Output: 5
fmt.Println(Add(5, 7)) // Output: 12
```

Here are a few things to note about the code:

- The `Add` function has a return type of `int`, which means it will return an integer value.
- Inside the function, the `+` operator is used to add the values of `x` and `y`.
- The result of the addition is then returned by the function.

You can test the `Add` function by providing different inputs to see how it works. In the provided examples, `Add(2, 3)` returns `5`, and `Add(5, 7)` returns `12`.
