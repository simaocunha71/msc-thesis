To solve this problem, you can define a function called "Add" that takes two integers as input and returns their sum. Here's the code for the solution:

```go
func Add(x int, y int) int {
    return x + y
}
```

You can then test the function with different inputs by calling it with the desired values and printing the result. For example, to add 2 and 3, you can use the following code:

```go
fmt.Println(Add(2, 3)) // Output: 5
```

Similarly, to add 5 and 7, you can use the following code:

```go
fmt.Println(Add(5, 7)) // Output: 12
```

By executing the code, you will get the desired output as the sum of the two input numbers.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println(Add(2, 3)) // 5
    fmt.Println(Add(5, 7)) // 12
}

func Add(x int, y int) int {
    return x + y
}
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println(Add(2, 3)) // 5
    fmt.Println(Add(5, 7)) // 12
}

func Add(x int, y int) int {
    return x + y
}
```

Here's an example of how you can use the "Add" function in Go to add two numbers and print the result:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println(Add(2, 3)) // 5
    fmt.Println(Add(5, 7)) // 12
}

func Add(x int, y int) int {
    return x + y
}
```

By running this code, you will see the desired output as the sum of the two input numbers.
