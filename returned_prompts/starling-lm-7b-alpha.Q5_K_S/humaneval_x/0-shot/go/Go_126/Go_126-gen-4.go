func IsSorted(lst []int) bool {
    length := len(lst)
    for i := 0; i < length-1; i++ {
        if lst[i] > lst[i+1] {
            return false
        }
    }
    return true
}

Explanation:
This solution first checks the length of the input list, and then iterates through all but the last element of the list. It checks if the current element is greater than the next element, and if so, returns false. If no such pair is found, it returns true.

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input list.

Space Complexity: O(1), since it only uses a constant amount of extra space.
