Derivative function is used to find the derivative of a given polynomial. Here, we have to find the derivative of the polynomial represented by the coefficients in the xs array.
The derivative of a polynomial can be calculated by differentiating each term with respect to x. The derivative of a single term ax^n is nax^(n-1). So, to find the derivative of the polynomial represented by xs array, we just need to multiply each coefficient by its corresponding power of x and increment the power of x by one.
Here is a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. Create an empty result array, rs, to store the derivative of the polynomial.
2. Iterate over the xs array using a for loop. For each coefficient, do the following:
   a. Multiply the coefficient by its corresponding power of x and increment the power of x by one. Add the result to the rs array.
3. Return the rs array as the result.

Here is the code for the above algorithm:

```go
func Derivative(xs []int) []int {
    rs := make([]int, len(xs))
    for i := 0; i < len(xs); i++ {
        rs[i] = xs[i] * (i + 1)
    }
    return rs
}
```

To test the function, you can use the following code:

```go
fmt.Println(Derivative([]int{3, 1, 2, 4, 5})) // prints: [1 4 12 20]
fmt.Println(Derivative([]int{1, 2, 3}))       // prints: [2 6]
```

This will print the derivative of the given polynomials, as shown in the problem statement.

Note: The above solution assumes that the xs array is not empty. If the xs array is empty, the result array will also be empty, as there are no terms to differentiate.
