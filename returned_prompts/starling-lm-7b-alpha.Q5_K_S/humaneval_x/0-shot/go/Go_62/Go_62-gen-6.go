To derive a polynomial with respect to x, we multiply each term by its corresponding power of x and then subtract 1 from the power of x. This gives us a new polynomial with the same number of terms as the original, but each term is one degree higher.

For example, the derivative of the polynomial x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x + 4 is 3x^2 + 4x + 4.

To solve this problem, we can iterate over the coefficients in the polynomial from the highest power of x to the lowest. For each coefficient, we multiply it by its corresponding power of x and append the result to the new derivative polynomial. Then, we subtract 1 from the power of x, and repeat the process until we reach the lowest power of x.

Here is the code to implement this approach:

```go
func Derivative(xs []int) []int {
    derivative := make([]int, len(xs)-1)
    for i := range xs {
        derivative[len(derivative)-(len(xs)-i-1)] = xs[i] * (i + 1)
    }
    return derivative
}
```

This function creates a new slice called `derivative` to store the derivative of the polynomial. It then iterates over the coefficients in the original polynomial from the highest power of x to the lowest. For each coefficient, it multiplies it by its corresponding power of x and appends the result to the `derivative` slice. Finally, it returns the `derivative` slice, which represents the derivative of the original polynomial.

For example, if we call `Derivative([]int{3, 1, 2, 4, 5})`, it will return `[1, 4, 12, 20]`, which represents the derivative of the polynomial 3x^4 + x^3 + 2x^2 + 4x + 5.

Similarly, if we call `Derivative([]int{1, 2, 3})`, it will return `[2, 6]`, which represents the derivative of the polynomial x^2 + 2x + 3.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of
