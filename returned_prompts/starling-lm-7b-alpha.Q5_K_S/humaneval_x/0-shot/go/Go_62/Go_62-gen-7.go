Derivative takes in an array of coefficients and returns the derivative of the polynomial represented by these coefficients. 

To solve this problem, we need to understand how derivatives work. 

The derivative of a polynomial is a new polynomial which represents the slope of the original polynomial at any point x. 

For example, the derivative of x^2 is 2x, the derivative of x^3 is 3x^2, and so on. 

To calculate the derivative of a polynomial, we need to apply the power rule, which states that the derivative of x^n is n*x^(n-1). 

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to solve this problem:

1. Initialize a new array to store the derivative. 
2. Loop through the input array from the last index to the first index. 
3. For each index, multiply the coefficient by the power rule for the derivative of x^n, which is n*x^(n-1). 
4. Append the result to the new array. 
5. Return the new array. 

Here's the implementation of the above algorithm in Go:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func Derivative(xs []int) []int {
    result := make([]int, len(xs))
    for i := len(xs) - 1; i >= 0; i-- {
        result[i] = xs[i] * (i + 1)
    }
    return result
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(Derivative([]int{3, 1, 2, 4, 5})) // [1, 4, 12, 20]
    fmt.Println(Derivative([]int{1, 2, 3})) // [2, 6]
}
```

In this code, we first create a new array called "result" to store the derivative. We then loop through the input array from the last index to the first index using the "range" keyword. For each index, we multiply the coefficient by the power rule for the derivative of x^n, which is n*x^(n-1). We append the result to the "result
