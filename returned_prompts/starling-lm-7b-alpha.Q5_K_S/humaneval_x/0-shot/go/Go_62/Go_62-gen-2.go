Derivative([]int{3, 1, 2, 4, 5}) should return [1, 4, 12, 20]
Derivative([]int{1, 2, 3}) should return [2, 6]

To solve this kata, you need to understand how to calculate the derivative of a polynomial. Here are some rules for calculating the derivative of a polynomial:

- The derivative of the coefficient of x^n is the coefficient * n.
- The derivative of the coefficient of x^0 is 0.
- The derivative of x^n is n * x^(n-1).

Based on these rules, we can write the following code:

func Derivative(xs []int) []int {
    n := len(xs)
    ys := make([]int, n)
    for i, x := range xs {
        if i == 0 {
            ys[i] = 0
        } else {
            ys[i] = x * (i + 1)
        }
    }
    return ys
}

This code will return the derivative of the polynomial in the same form as the input, i.e., as a slice of integers.
