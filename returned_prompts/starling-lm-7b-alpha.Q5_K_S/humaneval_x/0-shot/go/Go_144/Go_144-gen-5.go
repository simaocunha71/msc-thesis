ANS:
To solve this problem, we need to understand how to multiply fractions together. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you understand the process:

1. First, we need to convert both fractions from strings to integers. We can do this using the `strconv.Atoi()` function in Go. This function takes a string as input and returns the integer value. We can use the `Split()` function to split the string at the "/" character and convert the numerator and denominator to integers separately.

2. Next, we need to calculate the product of the two fractions. We can do this by multiplying the numerator of the first fraction (xNumerator) by the numerator of the second fraction (nNumerator), and then multiplying the denominator of the first fraction (xDenominator) by the denominator of the second fraction (nDenominator). This gives us the product of the two fractions.
