In this case, you can use the Newton-Raphson method to solve for the root of the equation Poly(xs, x) = 0.

The Newton-Raphson method is an iterative root-finding algorithm that starts with an initial guess x0 and refines it in an iterative manner until the root is found.

Here's how the algorithm works:

1. Start with an initial guess x0. This can be any value, but it should be reasonably close to the root.

2. Calculate the derivative of the function Poly(xs, x) at the current value of x. This is the slope of the tangent line to the function at that point.

3. Use the formula x1 = x0 - f(x0) / f'(x0) to update the value of x. Here, f(x0) is the value of the function Poly(xs, x) at the current value of x, and f'(x0) is the slope of the tangent line.

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the value of x converges to the root. This means that the change in x from one iteration to the next becomes very small.

Here's a Python function that implements the Newton-Raphson method to find the root of a polynomial:

import math

def find_root(coeffs, initial_guess):
