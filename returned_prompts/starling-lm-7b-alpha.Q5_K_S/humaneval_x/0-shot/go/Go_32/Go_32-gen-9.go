ANSWER:
To solve this problem, we can use the Newton's method, which is an iterative method to find the root of a function. In this case, we want to find the x value that makes the polynomial equal to zero, so we can use the following equation:

f(x) = a_n * x^n + a_(n-1) * x^(n-1) + ... + a_1 * x + a_0 = 0

where a_n, a_(n-1), ..., a_1, a_0 are the coefficients of the polynomial, and n is the degree of the polynomial.

To find the root of this equation, we can use the following formula:

x = b / a - (b^2) / (a + a^2)

where a and b are the coefficients of the polynomial. In this case, a is a_n and b is a_(n-1).

We can use this formula to iteratively update the value of x until it
