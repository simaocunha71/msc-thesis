The function FindZero is used to find the x point where the polynomial Poly(x) = 0. This function should only be used for even number coefficients. If the coefficients are not even, it will return NaN.

For example, the polynomial f(x) = 1 + 2x is zero at x = -0.5. The polynomial (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3 is zero at x = 1.

The FindZero function first checks if the length of the coefficient list is odd or not. If it is odd, it will return NaN. If it is even, it will calculate the zero point of the polynomial.

The FindZero function first initializes a variable x with the last coefficient of the coefficient list divided by the second last coefficient. Then, it uses a for loop to adjust the value of x by subtracting the ratio of the coefficient at position i to the coefficient at position i + 2. This process is repeated until the first four coefficients are processed. Finally, the value of x is returned as the zero point of the polynomial.

For example, if the coefficient list is [1, 2], the initial value of x is 1/2. After the for loop, x becomes -0.5, which is the zero point of the polynomial 1 + 2x. If the coefficient list is [-6, 11, -6, 1], the initial value of x is -6/1 = -6. After the for loop, x becomes 1, which is one of the zero points of the polynomial (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3) = -6 + 11x -
