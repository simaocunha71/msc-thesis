I'm trying to understand the FindZero function in this code, but I'm having difficulty understanding the logic behind the line `return (-a+math.Sqrt(math.Pow(a, 2)-b*b))/b`.

Why is this line necessary and how can I derive the logic behind it?

In the code, the `FindZero` function is used to find the zero point of a polynomial. The polynomial is defined by the coefficients in the `xs` slice. The function uses the Newton-Raphson method to find the zero point.

The logic behind the line `return (-a+math.Sqrt(math.Pow(a, 2)-b*b))/b` is related to the Newton-Raphson method. The Newton-Raphson method is an iterative method used to find the roots of a real-valued function. It is particularly useful for finding the roots of a polynomial equation.

In the context of the `FindZero` function, the Newton-Raphson method is used to find the roots of the polynomial equation `f(x) = 0`, where `f(x)` is the polynomial defined by the coefficients in the `xs` slice. The method involves iteratively updating the value of `x` using the formula `x_new = x_old - f(x_old)/f'(x_old)`. Here, `f'(x)` denotes the derivative of the
