To solve a polynomial equation you need to find the roots of the polynomial.
A root of a polynomial is a value of x that makes the polynomial equal to zero.

Here are some resources to understand the concept:

- [Wikipedia: Polynomial equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_equation): explains about polynomial equations and some methods of finding the roots.
- [Polynomial Roots](https://www.mathopenref.com/polynomialroots.html): This website explains in depth the concept of polynomial roots.
- [How to find the roots of a polynomial](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/polynomials-roots.html): This website explains the concept of polynomial roots and provides a step-by-step guide on how to find the roots of a polynomial.

Here are some methods to find the roots of a polynomial:

- [Newton's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method): It is an iterative method to find the roots of a function. It starts with an initial guess and improves it successively until the root is found. It is particularly useful for finding roots of complex functions.
- [Bisection method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection_method): It is a simple and reliable method to find the roots of a function. It starts with two points and divides the interval between them into two equal parts. The function is evaluated at the midpoint and if the function changes sign, the root is in that interval. The process is repeated until the root is found.
- [Regular bisection method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_bisection_method): It is a variation of the bisection method where the function is evaluated at the midpoint of the interval and if the function does not change
