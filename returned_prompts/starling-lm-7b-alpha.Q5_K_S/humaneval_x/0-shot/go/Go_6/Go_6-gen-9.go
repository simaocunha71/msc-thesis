To achieve this, you can follow these steps:
1. Define a function ParseNestedParens that takes a string as input.
2. Initialize an empty slice called result to store the depth of nesting for each group of parentheses.
3. Initialize a variable called depth to keep track of the current depth of nesting.
4. Split the input string into individual groups of parentheses using the strings.Split function and separating them with spaces.
5. Iterate over each group of parentheses.
6. For each group, initialize a variable start to keep track of the current depth of nesting.
7. Iterate over each character in the group of parentheses.
8. Check if the character is an opening parenthesis ('('). If so, increment the start variable by 1.
9. Check if the character is a closing parenthesis (')'). If so, decrement the start variable by 1.
10. Update the depth variable by taking the maximum value between the current depth and the start variable.
11. After iterating over all the characters in the group of parentheses, append the depth variable to the result slice.
12. Repeat steps 6-11 for
