Here's the Go source code:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func CarRaceCollision(n int) int {
    return n
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(CarRaceCollision(1))
    fmt.Println(CarRaceCollision(2))
    fmt.Println(CarRaceCollision(3))
    fmt.Println(CarRaceCollision(4))
    fmt.Println(CarRaceCollision(5))
}
```

Explanation:

The question is essentially asking for the number of "collisions" or intersections that occur between the two sets of cars. Since the cars are moving in opposite directions at the same speed, they will always meet halfway. Therefore, the number of collisions is equal to the number of cars in each set.

In the provided code, the `CarRaceCollision` function takes an integer `n` as input and simply returns `n`. This means that the number of collisions is equal to the number of cars in each set.

In the `main` function, the `CarRaceCollision` function is called with different values of `n` (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) to demonstrate its behavior. The result of each function call is then printed using `fmt.Println`.

The output of the program will be:
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

This indicates that there are `n` collisions when there are `n` cars in each set.

Note: This solution assumes that the cars are infinitely strong and continue moving as if they did not collide.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func CarRaceCollision(n int) int {
    return n
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(CarRaceCollision(1))
    fmt.Println(CarRaceCollision(2))
    fmt.Println(CarRaceCollision(3))
    fmt.Println(CarRaceCollision(4))
    fmt.Println(CarRaceCollision(5))
}
```
