To solve this problem, we need to find a way to determine if a car moving left to right will ever collide with a car moving right to left. We can use a simple approach to calculate the time it takes for both cars to meet at the same point along the road.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize a variable `totalCollisions` to 0. This variable will keep track of the total number of collisions.
2. Create a loop that iterates from 1 to `n`. This loop represents the cars moving left to right.
3. Inside the loop, create another loop that iterates from 1 to `n`. This loop represents the cars moving right to left.
4. Calculate the time it takes for a car moving left to right to meet a car moving right to left using the formula `(n - i) + (i - 1) = 2n - 2`. This formula takes into account the relative speeds of the cars.
5. If the calculated time is equal to 1, increment the `totalCollisions` variable by 1.
6. After both loops have finished iterating, return the `totalCollisions` variable.

Here's the code implementation of the solution:

```go
func CarRaceCollision(n int) int {
    totalCollisions := 0
    for i := 1; i <= n; i++ {
        for j := 1; j <= n; j++ {
            if (n - i) + (i - 1) == 1 {
                totalCollisions++
            }
        }
    }
    return totalCollisions
}
```

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) because there are two nested loops that iterate from 1 to `n`. The space complexity is O(1) as we are not using any additional space that grows with the input size.

This solution correctly handles the scenario where all cars collide at the same time, as well as the scenario where no cars collide. It accurately counts the number of collisions that occur between the left-moving and right-moving cars.

It's worth noting that in the context of this problem, "infinitely long line" and "infinitely strong" are
