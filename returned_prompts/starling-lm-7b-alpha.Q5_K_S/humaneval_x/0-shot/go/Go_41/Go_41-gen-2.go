To solve this problem, we can use the fact that the cars are traveling at the same speed, and that the road is infinitely long. This means that the cars will collide at a rate of one collision per second, regardless of their starting positions.

Therefore, the function `CarRaceCollision` can simply return the value of `n`, as all `n` cars will collide with each other at some point.

Here's an example implementation of the `CarRaceCollision` function in Python:

```python
def CarRaceCollision(n: int) -> int:
    return n
```

In this code, the `CarRaceCollision` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the value of `n` as the result. This represents the number of collisions that will occur in the car race.

It's important to note that this solution assumes that the cars are infinitely strong and that collisions have no impact on their movement. Additionally, it assumes that the cars will always collide with each other at some point, regardless of their starting positions.

In a real-world scenario, the actual number of collisions might be different due to factors such as varying speeds, obstacles, or other environmental factors. However, for the purposes of this problem, we can simplify the scenario to assume that all cars travel at the same speed and will eventually collide.

Overall, the `CarRaceCollision` function provides a straightforward solution to the problem, returning the value of `n` as the number of collisions that will occur in the car race.

```python
def CarRaceCollision(n: int) -> int:
    return n
```

This code snippet demonstrates a Python implementation of the `CarRaceCollision` function. It takes an integer `n` as input and returns `n` as the result, indicating the number of collisions that will occur in the car race.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the `CarRaceCollision` function works:

1. The function `CarRaceCollision` is defined with a single parameter `n`, which represents the number of cars in the race.
2. Inside the function, the value of `n` is returned as the result. This means that
