// We need to find an equation of the form ax + by = gcd(a,b) where the gcd is odd.
// This will ensure that when n is odd, the result is odd, and when n is even, the
// result is even.
//
// Let's start with a = 3 and b = 2, and try to find a gcd such that the gcd is odd.
// The gcd of 3 and 2 is 1, and 3*2*1 = 6. Since 6 is even, we need to keep looking.
// The gcd of 3 and 2 is 1, and 3*3*1 = 9. Since 9 is odd, we can use this result.
//
// Let's go with this result and compute the result for each value of n.

    if n % 2 == 0 {
