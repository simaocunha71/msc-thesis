To solve this problem, we need to find out the number of cars that will collide with each other. We know that the cars are moving in the same speed and they are moving in two different directions. Since the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, they continue moving even if they collide with each other. Therefore, the number of collisions is equal to the number of cars.

Here is the code to solve the problem:

```go
func CarRaceCollision(n int) int {
    return n
}
```

In this code, the function `CarRaceCollision` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the number of collisions as an integer. Since the number of cars is equal to the number of collisions, the function simply returns `n`.

This solution assumes that the cars are moving at the same speed and they are moving in the same direction. If the cars are moving at different speeds or in different directions, the number of collisions would be different.

In the given problem, it is not specified whether the cars are moving at the same speed or in the same direction. Therefore, the provided solution assumes the simplest case where the cars are moving at the same speed and in the same direction, resulting in the number of collisions being equal to the number of cars.

Note that this solution does not consider the actual physical properties of the cars, such as their mass or the force of impact. It only considers the number of cars and their relative motion to determine the number of collisions.

In summary, the provided solution returns the number of cars as the number of collisions, assuming that the cars are moving at the same speed and in the same direction.

```go
func CarRaceCollision(n int) int {
    return n
}
```

This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns an integer representing the number of collisions.

The provided solution assumes that the cars are moving at the same speed and in the same direction. If this assumption is incorrect, the number of collisions may be different from the number of cars.

The provided solution does not consider the physical properties of the cars, such as their mass or the force of impact. It only considers the number of cars and their relative motion to determine the number of collisions.
