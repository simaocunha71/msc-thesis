To solve this problem, we can use the concept of "symmetry" to simplify the problem.

The function CarRaceCollision takes one parameter, which is the number of cars that are moving in each direction. However, because of the symmetry, we only need to calculate the number of collisions for half of the cars that are moving left to right, and double the result. 

To determine the number of collisions, we can divide the total number of cars in half, and then use a loop to iterate over each car. For each car, we can calculate the distance it travels by multiplying the car's position by the speed. 

Finally, we can compare the distance of each car to the total distance of all the cars that are moving in the opposite direction. If the distance is greater than or equal to the total distance, we can increment a counter variable to keep track of the number of collisions. 

After the loop is complete, we can return the counter variable, which represents the number of collisions.

Here's an example of how the function can be implemented in Python:

```python
def CarRaceCollision(n):
    counter = 0
    for i in range(n):
        distance = i * speed
        total_distance = (n - 1) * speed
        if distance >= total_distance:
            counter += 1
    return counter * 2
```

This function will return the number of collisions between the cars as an integer value.

Note: The speed of the cars is assumed to be 1 unit per car for simplicity, but it can be modified in the function if needed.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), as it iterates over each car once, and the space complexity is O(1), as it only uses a single variable to keep track of the collisions.

In the context of the provided problem, the function CarRaceCollision can be used to determine the number of collisions between the cars, where n cars are driving left to right and simultaneously, a different set of n cars are driving right to left. 

The function can be called with a single integer parameter, which represents the total number of cars in each direction. It will return the total number of collisions as an integer value.
