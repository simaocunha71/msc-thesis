In the car race, the left to right car will collide with every right to left car, and vice versa.
Thus, the number of collisions is equal to the number of cars in the race, no matter whether `n` is odd or even.

Here's a different way to think about this:

- If `n` is even, then half the cars on the left are going to collide with the half the cars on the right.
- If `n` is odd, then half the cars on the left (rounded up) are going to collide with the half the cars on the right.

Here are the first few values for `n`:

```
  n  | Collisions
-----|------------
   1 |         1
   2 |         2
   3 |         2
   4 |         2
   5 |         3
   6 |         3
   7 |         3
   8 |         2
```

As you can see, the function you provided does not calculate the correct answer (it should always return `n`).

Here's a correct implementation:

```go
func CarRaceCollision(n int) int {
    return n
}
```

```
