// We can determine that the function is O(1)

Since all cars are moving at the same speed, if one car from the right-hand side of the road reaches the left-hand side at time t, then every car on the left-hand side of the road will reach the right-hand side of the road at time t + 2n.

This is because the left-hand side cars are moving at a rate of speed that is twice that of the right-hand side cars. Therefore, the left-hand side cars will catch up to the right-hand side cars and pass them at a rate of 2n.

For example, if we have 3 cars moving from left to right and 3 cars moving from right to left, at some point in time all of the cars will collide simultaneously.

In other words, there will be a collision every time a car from the right-hand side of the road reaches the left-hand side. Since there are n cars moving from right to left, there will be n collisions.

Here's an example implementation of the function in Python:

```python
def CarRaceCollision(n):
    return n
```

This implementation simply returns the value of n, which represents the number of collisions.

The time complexity of this function is O(1) because the function's output is independent of the input size. The space complexity is also O(1) because no additional memory is needed to solve the problem.

In summary, the function CarRaceCollision(n) returns the number of collisions between the two sets of cars, which is equal to the number of cars moving from right to left. The time and space complexity of the function are both O(1).

Here's an example usage of the function:

```python
print(CarRaceCollision(3))  # Output: 3
```

In this example, the function is called with the input value of 3, which means that there are 3 cars moving from right to left. The function returns the value 3, indicating that there will be 3 collisions between the two sets of cars.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.
