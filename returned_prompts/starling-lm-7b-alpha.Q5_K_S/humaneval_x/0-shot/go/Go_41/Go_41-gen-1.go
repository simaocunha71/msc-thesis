// This function is wrong:
// The function uses the modulus operator to divide n by 2. If n is odd,
// the modulus operator will return 1, and if n is even, the modulus operator
// will return 0. The modulus operator will never return a value in between 0 and 1.

// The function then checks to see if n is even by checking if the modulus
// operator is equal to 0. If it is, then the function returns n/2. If the modulus
// operator is not equal to 0, then the function returns n/2 + 1.

// The modulus operator is not the right operator to use in this case. The correct
// operator to use is the remainder operator, which will return a value in between 0
// and n - 1.

// Here is the correct function:

func CarRaceCollision(n int) int {

    result := 0
    if n % 2 == 0 {
        result = n / 2
    } else {
        result = n / 2 + 1
    }
    return result

}

This function is wrong:

func CarRaceCollision(n int) int {

    result := 0
    if n % 2 == 0 {
        result = n / 2
    } else {
        result = n / 2 + 1
    }
    return result

}

The function is wrong because of two reasons:

1. The modulus operator is used instead of the remainder operator. The modulus
   operator will return either 0 or 1, but it will not return a value in between.
   The remainder operator, on the other hand, will return a value in between 0
   and n - 1. As a result, the function will always return either 0 or 1, instead
   of returning the number of collisions.

2. The function returns the number of collisions, but the number of collisions
   is actually the number of
