The number of collisions is equal to the number of cars. Here's why:

Let's say the cars are moving at a speed of 1 unit of distance per unit of time. 

Let's say that the left-moving car at the leftmost edge of the road starts at time t = 0, moving rightwards. This car will collide with the rightmost car at time t = n.

Let's say that the right-moving car at the rightmost edge of the road starts at time t = 0, moving leftwards. This car will collide with the leftmost car at time t = n.

Since both cars move at a speed of 1 unit of distance per unit of time, a car moving from left to right will collide with a car moving from right to left at exactly the same time as the car moving from left to right collides with the car moving from right to left.

Therefore, the number of collisions is equal to the number of cars, which is n.

This is a bit of a trick question. In reality, cars cannot collide in this manner, since they have mass and momentum, and are subject to conservation of energy. However, in the abstract world of mathematics, where the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, this is a valid question.

In conclusion, the function should return n, the number of cars.

Here's a possible implementation of the function in Go:

```go
func CarRaceCollision(n int) int {
    return n
}
```

This function takes an integer n as input, and returns an integer representing the number of collisions between the left-moving and right-moving cars.

Note that this function assumes that all cars move at the same speed, and that there are no obstacles or other factors that could affect the collisions. In a real-world scenario, these assumptions would not necessarily hold true, and the number of collisions could be different.

I hope this explanation helps you understand the concept behind the function and how it works!

Here's the implementation of the function in Python:

```python
def CarRaceCollision(n):
    return n
```

This function takes an integer n as input, and returns an integer representing the number
