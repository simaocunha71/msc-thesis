// Here are some extra details about the problem:

// The input list contains only positive numbers.
// This means that we do not need to check if a number is positive or not.
// However, we need to check if a number is an integer or not.


// It is also worth noting that we have to return the result as an integer
// even though the input parameter is a slice of float64.
