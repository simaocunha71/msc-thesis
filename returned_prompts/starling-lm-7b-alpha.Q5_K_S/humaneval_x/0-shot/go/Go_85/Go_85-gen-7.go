// This function takes a non-empty list of integers and returns the sum of the even elements at odd indices.

// For example, if you call Add with the list [4, 2, 6, 7], it will return 2 because only 2 is an even number at an odd index (index 1).

// The function uses a for loop to iterate over each element in the list. It checks if the element is both even (i.e., divisible by 2) and at an odd index (i.e., the index is not divisible by 2). If both conditions are met, the element is added to the sum.

// Finally, the function returns the sum of all the even elements at odd indices.

// Note: This solution assumes that the input list is non-empty, meaning it contains at least one integer. If the list is empty, the function will return 0.

In the given code, the Add function takes a slice of integers as an argument and returns an integer. It initializes a variable sum to 0 to keep track of the sum of even elements at odd indices. 

The function then iterates over each element in the input list using a for loop. For each element, it checks if the element is both even (i.e., divisible by 2) and at an odd index (i.e., the index is not divisible by 2). If both conditions are met, the element is added to the sum using the addition assignment operator (+=). 

After iterating through all the elements in the list, the function returns the final sum of the even elements at odd indices. 

In the provided example, the function is called with the list [4, 2, 6, 7]. The even element
