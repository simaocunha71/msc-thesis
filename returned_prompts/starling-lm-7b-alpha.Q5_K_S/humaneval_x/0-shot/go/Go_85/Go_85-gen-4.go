```go
result := 0

for i := 0; i < len(lst); i++ {
    if i%2 != 0 && lst[i]%2 == 0 {
        result += lst[i]
    }
}
return result
```

Explanation:

The code starts by initializing a variable `result` to 0. Then it uses a for loop to iterate over each element in the `lst` array. Inside the loop, it checks if the index `i` is odd (i%2 != 0) and if the element at index `i` is even (lst[i]%2 == 0). If both conditions are true, it adds the element to the `result` variable using the `+=` operator. Finally, it returns the `result` variable, which contains the sum of all the even elements at odd indices in the `lst` array.

Overall, this solution effectively adds the even elements at odd indices of the input list and returns the sum.
