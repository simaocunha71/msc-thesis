In the Add() function, the goal is to add the even elements at odd indices of the input list lst. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize a variable called result to store the sum of even elements at odd indices.
2. Use a for loop to iterate through the list lst. The loop should start from index 0 and stop before the length of the list (i.e., len(lst)).
3. Inside the loop, check if the current element at index i is even by using the modulo operator (%). If the remainder of dividing the element by 2 is equal to 0, it means the element is even.
4. If the current element is even and the index i is odd (i % 2 == 1), add the element to the result variable.
5. After the loop finishes, return the value of the result variable as the result of the function.

Here's the code snippet that implements the solution:

```go
func Add(lst []int) int {
    result := 0
    for i := 0; i < len(lst); i++ {
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0 && i%2 == 1 {
            result += lst[i]
        }
    }
    return result
}
```

By following this approach, the Add() function will correctly add the even elements at odd indices of the input list and return the sum as the result.

```go
fmt.Println(Add([]int{4, 2, 6, 7}))  // Output: 2
```

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func Add(lst []int) int {
    result := 0
    for i := 0; i < len(lst); i++ {
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0 && i%2 == 1 {
            result += lst[i]
        }
    }
    return result
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(Add([]int{4, 2, 6, 7}))  // Output: 2
}
```
