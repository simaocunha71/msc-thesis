// Initialize the result to zero
res := 0

// Iterate over the list
for i := 0; i < len(lst); i++ {
    // If the element at the index is even and the index is odd
    if lst[i] % 2 == 0 && i % 2 != 0 {
        // Add it to the result
        res += lst[i]
    }
}

return res

}

In this code, the function Add takes a non-empty list of integers lst as a parameter and returns an integer value. The function initializes a variable res to zero to store the result. It then iterates over the list using a for loop. Inside the loop, it checks if the element at the current index is even (i.e., the remainder of the element divided by 2 is zero) and if the index itself is odd (i.e., the remainder of the index divided by 2 is non-zero). If both conditions are true, the element is added to the result using the += operator. Finally, the function returns the result.

This solution effectively adds the even elements at odd indices of the given list, as requested in the problem statement.

To use this solution, you can call the Add function with a non-empty list of integers as an argument. For example, if you have a list [4, 2, 6, 7], you can call Add([4, 2, 6, 7]) to get the result, which in this case would be 2.

// O(n) time | O(1) space

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) because it iterates over the input list once. The space complexity is O(1) as it only uses a constant amount of extra space to store the result.

Overall, this solution provides an efficient and concise way to add the even elements at odd indices of a non-empty list of integers.

Here are some additional details about the code:

- The function Add takes a non-empty list of integers lst as a parameter and returns an integer value.
- It initializes a variable res to zero to store the result.
- It uses a for loop to iterate over the list.
- Inside the loop, it checks if the element
