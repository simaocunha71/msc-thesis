// Time complexity: O(n)
// Space complexity: O(1)

// The time complexity of the Add function is O(n) because we need to go through each element in the list once.

// The space complexity of the Add function is O(1) because we don't need any extra space to store the result or any other variables. We only use a few local variables that don't count towards the space complexity.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    lst := []int{4, 2, 6, 7}
    result := Add(lst)
    fmt.Println(result)
}

func Add(lst []int) int {
    result := 0
    for i := 0; i < len(lst); i++ {
        if i%2 == 1 && lst[i]%2 == 0 {
            result += lst[i]
        }
    }
    return result
}
```

In this code, we define a function called Add that takes a list of integers as an argument and returns an integer. The function iterates through each element in the list using a for loop. Inside the loop, it checks if the index of the current element is odd (i%2 == 1) and if the element itself is even (lst[i]%2 == 0). If both conditions are true, it adds the element to the result variable. Finally, it returns the result.

To test the function, we create a list called lst with some example values. We then call the Add function with lst as the argument and store the result in a variable called result. Finally, we print the result to the console using the fmt.Println function.

The time complexity of the Add function is O(n) because we need to go through each element in the list once. The space complexity of the Add function is O(1) because we don't need any extra space to
