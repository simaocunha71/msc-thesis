ANSWER:
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Create a slice called `fib` to store the Fibonacci numbers. Initialize it with the first two Fibonacci numbers, 0 and 1.
2. Create a slice called `prime` to store the boolean values indicating whether a number is prime or not. Initialize all the values to true.
3. Iterate from 2 to `2*n + 1` to calculate the Fibonacci numbers and check if they are prime.
4. If the Fibonacci number is less than `2*n + 1`, mark it as prime in the `prime` slice.
5. Check if the Fibonacci number is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of the Fibonacci number. If it is divisible, mark it as non-prime in the `prime` slice.
6. After checking all the Fibonacci numbers up to `n`, iterate from `2*n` to 1 and return the
