The function returns the result when the Fibonacci number is a prime number. If the Fibonacci number is not a prime number, it continues the loop until it finds a prime Fibonacci number. 

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the function:

1. The function initializes two variables, `a` and `b`, with the values 0 and 1, respectively. These variables represent the first two Fibonacci numbers.

2. The function enters a loop that iterates `n` times. In each iteration, the values of `a` and `b` are swapped, and the new Fibonacci number is calculated by adding `a` and `b`.

3. Inside the loop, there is another loop that starts from 2 and goes up to the square root of the Fibonacci number. This inner loop checks if the Fibonacci number is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of the Fibonacci number. If it is divisible, the inner loop breaks and the function continues to the next iteration of the outer loop.

4. If the inner loop completes without finding a divisor, it means that the Fibonacci number
