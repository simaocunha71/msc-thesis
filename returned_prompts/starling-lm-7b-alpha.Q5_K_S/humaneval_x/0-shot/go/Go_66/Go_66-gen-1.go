E:

func Digitsum(x string) int {
    sum := 0
    for _, r := range x {
        if r >= 'A' && r <= 'Z' {
            sum += int(r) - 'A' + 1
        }
    }
    return sum
}

Explanation:
The given function takes a string as input and returns the sum of the upper characters only' ASCII codes.
To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the string and check if it is an uppercase letter. If it is, we add its ASCII code to the sum. The ASCII code of an uppercase letter can be obtained by subtracting the ASCII code of 'A' from the ASCII code of the letter and adding 1. Finally, we return the sum.

In the provided solution, we define a function called Digitsum that takes a string as input and returns an integer. Inside the function, we initialize a variable called sum to 0. Then, we iterate through each character in the string using the range keyword. For each character, we check if it is an uppercase letter by using the condition r >= 'A' && r <= 'Z'. If the condition is true, we add the ASCII code of the character to the sum by subtracting the ASCII code of 'A' from the ASCII code of the character and adding 1. Finally, we return the sum.

The provided examples demonstrate how the function can be used to calculate the sum of the upper characters' ASCII codes in different strings.

In the first example, Digitsum("") returns 0 because there are no uppercase letters in the string.
In the second example, Digitsum("abAB") returns 131 because the ASCII codes of the uppercase letters A and B are 65 and 66, respectively, and their sum is 131.
In the third example, Digitsum
