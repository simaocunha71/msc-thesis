To solve this problem, we need to check if the sum of the elements in the list q is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight w and if the list is balanced (palindromic). Here's how we can do it:

1. First, we need to check if the list q is palindromic. A palindromic list is a list that reads the same forwards and backwards. We can determine this by comparing the first half of the list with the second half. If they are the same, then the list is palindromic.

2. Next, we need to calculate the sum of the elements in the list q. We can do this by using the built-in `sum()` function in Go.

3. Finally, we need to check if the sum of the elements in the list q is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight w. If it is, then the object q will fly and we return true. Otherwise, it won't fly and we return false.

Here's the complete solution code in Go:

```go
func WillItFly(q []int, w int) bool {
    // Check if q is palindromic
    for i := 0; i < len(q)/2; i++ {
        if q[i] != q[len(q)-i-1] {
            return false
        }
    }

    // Calculate the sum of the elements in q
    sum := sum(q)

    // Check if the sum of the elements in q is less than or equal to w
    if sum <= w {
        return true
    } else {
        return false
    }
}
```

You can use this function to determine if an object will fly or not. It takes a list `q` of integers and a maximum possible weight `w` as input, and returns true if the object will fly, and false otherwise.

For example, if you call `WillItFly([]int{1, 2}, 5)`, it will return false because the sum of the elements in the list (1 + 2 = 3) is greater than the maximum possible weight (5). Similarly, if you call `WillItFly([]int{3, 2, 3}, 1)
