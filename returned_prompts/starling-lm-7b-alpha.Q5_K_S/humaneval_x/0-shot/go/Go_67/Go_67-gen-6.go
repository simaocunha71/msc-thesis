    strs := strings.Split(s," and ")
    apples, _ := strconv.Atoi(strs[0][strings.Index(strs[0]," ")+1:])
    oranges, _ := strconv.Atoi(strs[1][:strings.Index(strs[1]," ")])
    return n - apples - oranges
}

Answer:This program defines a function FruitDistribution that takes a string and an integer as input and returns an integer. The function first splits the string based on " and " into two substrings. It then converts the first substring to an integer representing the number of apples, and the second substring to an integer representing the number of oranges. Finally, it returns the difference between the total number of fruits in the basket and the number of apples and oranges, which represents the number of mango fruits in the basket.

For example, FruitDistribution("5 apples and 6 oranges", 19) returns 19 - 5 - 6 = 8, FruitDistribution("0 apples and 1 oranges",3) returns 3 - 0 - 1 = 2, and FruitDistribution("2 apples and 3 oranges", 100) returns 100 - 2 - 3 = 95.

In summary, this program defines a function to calculate the number of mango fruits in the basket based on the number of apples, oranges, and the total number of fruits given as input.
