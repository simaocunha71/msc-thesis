To solve this problem we need to follow these steps:

1. Replace all spaces in the string with underscores.
2. If the string has more than 2 consecutive spaces, then replace all consecutive spaces with -

To replace all spaces with underscores, we can use the strings package in Go, which provides a Replace method that replaces all occurrences of a substring with a replacement substring. In this case, we want to replace spaces with underscores, so we can use strings.Replace to achieve this:

strings.Replace(text, " ", "_", -1)

However, we also need to handle the case where there are more than 2 consecutive spaces. To do this, we can use regular expressions to find all occurrences of more than 2 spaces in the string. We can use the regexp package in Go to achieve this:

regexp.MustCompile(`\s{3,}`).ReplaceAllString(text, "-")

Finally, we can combine these two steps to create the FixSpaces function:

func FixSpaces(text string) string {
    return strings.Replace(text, " ", "_", -1) + regexp.MustCompile(`\s{3,}`).ReplaceAllString("-")
}

This function will replace all spaces in the string with underscores, and replace all occurrences of more than 2 consecutive spaces with -.

For example, if we call FixSpaces("Example   3") with this function, it will return "_Example_3" because there are 3 spaces between "Example" and "3", and the function replaces all occurrences of more than 2 consecutive spaces with -.

Here is the code for the FixSpaces function:

package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "regexp"
    "strings"
)

func FixSpaces(text string) string {
    return strings.Replace(text, " ", "_", -1) + regexp.MustCompile(`\s{3,}`).ReplaceAllString("-")
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(FixSpaces("Example")) // "Example"
    fmt.Println(FixSpaces("Example 1")) // "Example_1"
    fmt
