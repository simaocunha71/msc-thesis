Here are some test cases:

EncodeShift("hello") -> "mjqqt"
DecodeShift("mjqqt") -> "hello"

Answer:
In the EncodeShift function, we start by converting the given string to an array of runes. This is important because a string is immutable in Go.

Next, we create a new empty array called newRunes to store the encoded runes. We iterate through each character in the original array of runes using a for loop.

Inside the loop, we add the encoded character to the newRunes array. To do this, we take the current character and add 5 to it. We then subtract 'a' from the result to get the position of the character in the alphabet. We use the modulus operator to ensure that the character does not go out of bounds of the alphabet. Finally, we add 'a' back to the result to get the encoded character.

After encoding all the characters in the original string, we return the string representation of the newRunes array.

In the DecodeShift function, we follow a similar process. We convert the input string to an array of runes and create a new empty array called newRunes to store the decoded runes. We iterate through each character in the original array of runes using a for loop.

Inside the loop, we add the decoded character to the newRunes array. To do this, we take the current character and subtract 5 from it. We then add 'a' to the result to get the position of the character in the alphabet. We use the modulus operator to ensure that the character does not go out of bounds of the alphabet. Finally, we subtract 'a' back from the result to get the decoded character.

After decoding all the characters in the input string, we return the string representation of the newRunes array.

The test cases provided show that the EncodeShift function correctly encodes the string "hello
