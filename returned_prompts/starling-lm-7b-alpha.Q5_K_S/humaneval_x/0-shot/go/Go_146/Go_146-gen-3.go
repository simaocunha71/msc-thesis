Answer:
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), and the space complexity is O(1).

Explanation:
The function Specialfilter iterates through the input array once, and for each element, it performs two divisions (one by 10 and one by the modulo 10) to extract the first and last digits of the number. Then it checks whether the sum of the first and last digits is odd. If so, it increments the count variable. Finally, it returns the count of elements that satisfy the conditions.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n) because it iterates through the input array once. The space complexity is O(1) because it uses a fixed amount of extra space to store the count variable.

Here's an example of how the function can be used:

nums := []int{15, -73, 14, -15}
result := Specialfilter(nums)
fmt.Println(result) // Output: 1

Another example:

nums := []int{33, -2, -3, 45, 21, 109}
result := Specialfilter(nums)
fmt.Println(result) // Output: 2

In the first example, the number 15 is greater than 10, and both its first and last digits (1 and 5) are odd. Therefore, the function returns 1.

In the second example, the numbers 33 and 21 satisfy the conditions, so the function returns 2.

Overall, the Specialfilter function efficiently counts the number of elements in the input array that meet the specified criteria of being greater than 10 and having both first and last digits odd.

Here's a summary of the time and space complexity of the Specialfilter function:

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O
