Answer:
The function Specialfilter takes an array of numbers as input and returns the number of elements in the array that are greater than 10 and both the first and last digits of a number are odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).

To solve this problem, we can iterate through each number in the array using a for loop and the range keyword. Inside the loop, we check if the number is greater than 10 using the condition v > 10. If the number is greater than 10, we continue to the next step.

Next, we calculate the sum of the first and last digits of the number using the expression (v/10%10 + v%10). The modulo operator % is used to get the remainder when dividing a number by 10. By adding the first and last digits together, we obtain a single digit number.

Finally, we check if the sum of the first and last digits is odd by using the condition (v/10%10 + v%10) % 2 == 1. If the condition is true, we increment the count variable by 1.

After iterating through all the numbers in the array, we return the count variable, which represents the number of elements in the array that satisfy the given conditions.

In the example provided, Specialfilter([15, -73, 14, -15]) returns 1 because there is only one element (15) that is greater than 10 and has both the first and last digits odd (1 and 5). Similarly, Specialfilter([33, -2, -3, 45, 21, 109]) returns 2 because there are two elements (33 and 21) that satisfy the conditions.

Overall, this function allows you to filter an array of numbers based on specific conditions related to the number's value and its first and last digits.
