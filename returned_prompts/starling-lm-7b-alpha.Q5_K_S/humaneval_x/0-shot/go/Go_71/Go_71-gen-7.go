I'm a bit confused about the function signature. Why is it returning an `interface{}` instead of a `float64`?

The function signature of `TriangleArea` should return a `float64` since the function itself is returning a `float64` value. The `interface{}` type is used as the return type of the function because the `fmt.Println` function is expecting an `interface{}` type as an argument.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The `TriangleArea` function takes three arguments of type `float64` representing the lengths of the three sides of a triangle.
2. Inside the function, it calculates the semi-perimeter of the triangle using the formula `(a + b + c) / 2`.
3. It then calculates the area of the triangle using Heron's formula `math.Sqrt(s * (s-a) * (s-b) * (s-c))`.
4. The calculated area is returned as the result of the function.
5. The `fmt.Println` function is used to print the result of the `TriangleArea` function, which is an `interface{}` type. This is necessary because the `fmt.Println` function can print values of any type that implement the `fmt.Stringer` interface, including `float64`.
6. The `interface{}` type is used as the return type of the `TriangleArea` function to match the expected type of the `fmt.Println` function.
7. The `fmt.Println` function is called with the result of the `TriangleArea` function as an argument, which is printed to the console.

So, in summary, the `interface{}` type is used as the return type of the `TriangleArea` function to accommodate the `fmt.Println` function's requirement of an `interface{}` type argument.

In Go, it's common to pass `interface{}` as the return type when you want to return a value of a specific type but you don't know
