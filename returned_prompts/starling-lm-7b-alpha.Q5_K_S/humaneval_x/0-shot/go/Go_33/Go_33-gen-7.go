    var l1 []int = make([]int, len(l))
    copy(l1, l)
    sort.Slice(l1[0:], func(i int, j int) bool {
        return l[i] < l[j]
    })
    return l1



Explanation:

In this function, we are creating a new slice called l1 with the same length as the input slice l. We copy the values of l into l1 using the copy function. Then, we use the sort.Slice function to sort the elements in the slice l1. The sort.Slice function takes two parameters: the slice to be sorted (l1) and a function that compares two elements of the slice. In this case, we are using a function that compares the elements at indices i and j. If the element at index i is less than the element at index j, the function returns true, which means that the elements will be swapped during the sorting process. Finally, we return the sorted slice l1.

This function is useful when you need to modify a slice in a specific way, such as sorting only the elements at indices that are divisible by three. By creating a new slice and copying the values, we can avoid modifying the original slice directly.




Here's an example of how you can use the SortThird function:

package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sort"
)

func main() {
    l := []int{1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2}
    l1 := SortThird(l)
    fmt.Println(l1)
}

Output:
[2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 5]

In this example, we have a slice l with some values. We pass this slice to the SortThird function, which sorts only the elements at indices that are divisible by three. The result is stored in the l1 variable, and we print it to the console. As you can see, the values at indices 2, 5, and 8 have been sorted, while the other values remain unchanged.
