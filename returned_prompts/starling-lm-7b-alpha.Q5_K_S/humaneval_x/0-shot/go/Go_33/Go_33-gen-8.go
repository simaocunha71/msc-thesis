I'm new to programming and I am having some issues with the SortThird function that I wrote. I am trying to sort the indices of a given list that are divisible by three but I am unsure of how to go about doing this. I was wondering if you could provide some guidance on how to write this function and explain what the provided solution does.

The provided solution first creates a new slice called `res` with the same length as the input slice `l`. It then iterates over each index in the input slice using a for loop. If the index is not divisible by three (i.e., `i%3 != 0`), it simply copies the value from the input slice to the corresponding index in the `res` slice. If the index is divisible by three, it copies the value from the input slice to the corresponding index in the `res` slice and then uses the `sort.Ints()` function to sort the slice from index 0 to `i+1`. The sorted slice is then copied back to the `res` slice at the corresponding index.

The `sort.Ints()` function is part of the Go standard library and is used to sort a slice of integers in ascending order. In this case, it is used to sort the slice from index 0 to `i+1`, which corresponds to the values at the indices that are divisible by three in the input slice.

The solution then returns the `res` slice, which contains the original values at indices that are not divisible by three and the sorted values at indices that are divisible by three.

Overall, the solution correctly implements the logic described in the function comment and returns the desired result.
