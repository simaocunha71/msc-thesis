    var result []string
    for i := 0; i <= n; i++ {
        result = append(result, strconv.Itoa(i))
    }
    return strings.Join(result, " ")
}




This code defines a function called StringSequence that takes an integer n as input and returns a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 up to n inclusive. The function uses a for loop to iterate from 0 to n, converting each number to a string using the strconv.Itoa function. The resulting string slice is joined into a single string using the strings.Join function with a space delimiter.

For example, if you call StringSequence(5), it will return the string "0 1 2 3 4 5", which is a space-delimited string of numbers from 0 to 5.

Here are some test cases to verify the correctness of the code:

Test case 1:
Input: StringSequence(0)
Expected Output: "0"

Test case 2:
Input: StringSequence(5)
Expected Output: "0 1 2 3 4 5"

The code correctly implements the required functionality and passes the test cases.
