    var res []string

I'm new to Golang, and I'm having a hard time understanding how the "strconv" package works. I know that it is a package that provides functions for converting strings to numeric types, but I'm not sure how to use it.

In the code you provided, you are using the "strconv" package to convert integers to strings. The "strconv.Itoa" function is used to convert an integer to a string. The "i" parameter in the "strconv.Itoa" function is the integer you want to convert to a string.

The "strconv.Itoa" function returns a string that represents the integer. In the code you provided, the return value of the "strconv.Itoa" function is appended to the "res" slice. The "res" slice is used to store the strings that represent the integers.

Finally, the "strings.Join" function is used to join the strings in the "res" slice with a space character as the delimiter. The result is a string that contains the space-delimited integers from 0 to n inclusive.

I hope this helps you understand how to use the "strconv" package in Golang!
