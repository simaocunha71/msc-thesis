In this code, what is the purpose of the if statement, and what does it do?

In this code, the if statement is used to check if the value of the variable n is equal to 0. If n is 0, the function returns a string containing the number 0 as its result. This is a simple way to handle the base case for the recursive function that follows.

The if statement is a control structure in programming that allows code to be executed only if a certain condition is met. In this case, the condition is that n is equal to 0.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The if statement checks if the value of n is equal to 0. If it is, the function returns a string containing the number 0.
2. If the value of n is not 0, the function continues to execute the code inside the if block, which creates a new strings.Builder instance and loops from 0 to n (inclusive).
3. Inside the loop, the function converts each number from 0 to n to a string using strconv.Itoa, and appends it to the strings.Builder instance.
4. After the loop, the function returns the string stored in the strings.Builder instance, which is the result of the function.

So, in summary, the if statement in this code is used to handle the base case of the recursive function. It checks if n is equal to 0 and returns a string containing the number 0 if it is.

Here are some examples of how the function can be used:

// Returns a string containing the numbers from 0 to 4, separated by spaces.
StringSequence(4) // "0 1 2 3 4"

// Returns a string containing only the number 0.
StringSequence(0) // "0"

// Returns an empty string because n is less than 0.
StringSequence(-1) // ""

In these examples, the function is called
