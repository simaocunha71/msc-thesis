    var result []string
    for i := 0; i <= n; i++ {
        result = append(result, strconv.Itoa(i))
    }
    return strings.Join(result, " ")
}


























I'm trying to write a function that returns a space-separated string of numbers from 0 to n inclusive.

For example:
StringSequence(0) returns "0"
StringSequence(5) returns "0 1 2 3 4 5"

Here is what I have so far. It returns the correct result, but it feels like there must be a better way to do it.

Any suggestions?
