To filter out and return only the positive numbers from a given list, you can follow the steps below:

1. Create a new empty slice called "positiveNumbers" to store the positive numbers.
2. Iterate through each element in the input list using a for loop.
3. Check if the current element is greater than zero (positive) using the condition "i > 0".
4. If the condition is true, append the current element to the "positiveNumbers" slice using the "append()" function.
5. Continue iterating through the rest of the elements in the input list.
6. After the loop is finished, return the "positiveNumbers" slice.

Here's an example implementation of the GetPositive function in Go:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func GetPositive(l []int) []int {
    positiveNumbers := []int{}

    for _, i := range l {
        if i > 0 {
            positiveNumbers = append(positiveNumbers, i)
        }
    }
    return positiveNumbers
}

func main() {
    l := []int{-1, 2, -4, 5, 6}
    fmt.Println(GetPositive(l)) // [2, 5, 6]

    l = []int{5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10}
    fmt.Println(GetPositive(l)) // [5, 3, 2, 3, 9, 123, 1]
}
```

By using this implementation, you can easily obtain a new slice containing only the positive numbers from any given list.

Note: In the provided code, the "range" keyword is used in the for loop to iterate through each element in the input list. The underscore (_) in the "for _, i := range l" statement is used to ignore the index of the elements and only focus on the values.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.
