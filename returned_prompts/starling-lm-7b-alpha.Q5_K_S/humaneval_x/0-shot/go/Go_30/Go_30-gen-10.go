To filter only positive numbers from the given list, you can use the built-in `filter()` function in Go, which returns a new slice containing only the elements that pass the condition specified by the provided function. In this case, you can use an anonymous function that checks if each element is greater than zero.

Here's the implementation of the `GetPositive()` function:

```go
func GetPositive(l []int) []int {
    return filter(l, func(i int) bool { return i > 0 })
}
```

Here's how it works:

1. The `filter()` function takes two arguments: the original slice `l` and a function `f` that defines the condition to filter the elements.
2. The `filter()` function iterates over each element in the slice `l`.
3. For each element, it calls the provided function `f` and checks if the returned value is `true`. If the function returns `true`, the element is included in the new slice; otherwise, it is skipped.
4. The `filter()` function returns the new slice containing only the elements that pass the condition.

You can use the `GetPositive()` function like this:

```go
positiveNumbers := GetPositive([]int{-1, 2, -4, 5, 6})
fmt.Println(positiveNumbers) // Output: [2, 5, 6]
```

This will return a slice with only the positive numbers from the input list: `[2, 5, 6]`.

Note: The `filter()` function is available in Go 1.18 and later versions. If you're using an older version of Go, you can implement the filtering logic manually using a `for` loop or other techniques.

Here's an example of implementing the filtering logic using a `for` loop:

```go
func GetPositive(l []int) []int {
    result := []int{}
    for _, i := range l {
        if i > 0 {
            result = append(result, i)
        }
    }
    return result
}
```

This implementation achieves the same result as the `filter
