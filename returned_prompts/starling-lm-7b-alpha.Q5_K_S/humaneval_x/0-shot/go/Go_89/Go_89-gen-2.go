    var result string
    for _, c := range s {
        result += string(c + 4 + 4*int(c))
    }
    return result
}

Answer:
import (
    "strings"
)

// Create a function Encrypt that takes a string as an argument and
// returns a string Encrypted with the alphabet being rotated.
// The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters
// shift down by two multiplied to two places.
// For example:
// Encrypt('hi') returns 'lm'
// Encrypt('asdfghjkl') returns 'ewhjklnop'
// Encrypt('gf') returns 'kj'
// Encrypt('et') returns 'ix'
func Encrypt(s string) string {

    var result string
    for _, c := range s {
        result += string(c + 4 + 4*int(c))
    }
    return result
}

Explanation:
This function takes a string and returns a string where the alphabet has been rotated.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. The function `Encrypt` takes a string `s` as an argument.
2. The variable `result` is declared to store the encrypted string.
3. The `for range` loop is used to iterate over each character (`c`) in the input string `s`.
4. Inside the loop, the current character `c` is shifted down by two multiplied by two places. This is done by adding 4 to the ASCII value of `c`, and then adding 4 times the ASCII value of `c`. The result is converted back to a string using the `string()` function and appended to the `result` string.
5. After all characters have been processed, the final `result` string is returned as the encrypted version of the input string.

Overall, this solution effectively rotates the alphabet by shifting down each character in the input string by two multiplied by two places, resulting in the desired encrypted output.

Here are some example test cases to validate the solution:

```go
fmt.Println(Encrypt("hi"))  // Output: l
