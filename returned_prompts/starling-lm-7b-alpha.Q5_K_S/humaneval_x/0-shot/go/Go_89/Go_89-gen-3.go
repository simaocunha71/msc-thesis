    var result string
    for _, r := range s {
        result += string(r + 2*2)
    }
    return result
}

I'm trying to encrypt a string in Go, but I don't understand why this code does not work.

It's possible that you're not familiar with the way string indexing works in Go. The code provided is trying to encrypt a string by adding two to each character in the string and then concatenating the result. However, the code is not working as expected.

The issue is that the indexing of strings in Go starts at 0 and goes up to the length of the string minus one. This means that when the code tries to access the character at index 2 in the string, it is actually accessing the character at index 1, since the index is zero-based.

To fix the code, you need to modify the indexing to start at 1 and go up to the length of the string. Here's the modified code:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "strings"
)

func Encrypt(s string) string {
    result := ""
    for i := 1; i <= len(s); i++ {
        r := int(s[i-1])
        result += string(r + 2*2)
    }
    return result
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(Encrypt("hi")) // lm
    fmt.Println(Encrypt("asdfghjkl")) // ewhjklnop
    fmt.Println(Encrypt("gf")) // kj
    fmt.Println(Encrypt("et")) // ix
}
```

In this modified code, the loop starts at index 1 and goes up to the length of the string. Inside the loop, the character at index `i-1` is accessed and its ASCII value is incremented by two multiplied by two. The result is then concatenated to the `result` string.

The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `Encrypt` function with some sample inputs.

Now, when you run the program, it should correctly encrypt the strings as expected.
