    result := ""
    for _, v := range s {
        result += string(v + (2 * 2))
    }
    return result
}



















I'm confused with the Encrypt function, as in the example Encrypt('gf') returns 'kj'

How does this work?

In the Encrypt function, you're using a for range loop to iterate over each character of the string. The loop variable v is of type rune, which is an alias for int32. You're adding 4 (2 * 2) to v and converting the result back to a string using string(v + 4). This means that each character in the string is shifted down by two multiplied to two places.

For example, if v is 'g' (its Unicode code point is 103), then v + 4 is 103 + 4 = 107, which is the Unicode code point of 'k'. Similarly, if v is 'f' (Unicode code point 102), then v + 4 is 102 + 4 = 106, which is the Unicode code point of 'j'.

Here's a breakdown of the Encrypt function for the example 'gf':

Encrypt('gf') -> 'lm'
'g' -> 'l' (g + 4)
'f' -> 'm' (f + 4)

So, the Encrypt function takes a string, iterates over each character, adds 4 to its Unicode code point, and converts the result back to a string. This results in the original string being shifted down by two multiplied to two places.
