```go
func CanArrange(arr []int) int {
    max := -1
    for i := 0; i < len(arr)-1; i++ {
        if arr[i] < arr[i+1] {
            max = i
        }
    }
    return max
}
```

Explanation:
The function CanArrange takes an array of integers as an argument and returns the largest index of an element that is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. If no such element exists, the function returns -1.

In the solution provided, a variable "max" is initialized with -1. Then, a for loop is used to iterate through the array from the first element to the second-to-last element. Inside the loop, an if statement checks if the current element (arr[i]) is less than the next element (arr[i+1]). If this condition is true, the value of "max" is updated with the index of the current element (i).

Finally, the function returns the value of "max" which represents the largest index of an element that is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. If no such element exists, the function returns -1.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) where n is the length of the input array, as the loop iterates through the array only once. The space complexity is O(1) as no additional memory is used apart from the "max" variable.

Overall, this solution provides a simple and efficient way to find the largest index of an element that is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it in an array.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    arr := []int{1, 2, 4, 3, 5}
    result := CanArrange(arr)
    fmt.Println(result)
}
```

In the provided code, the function CanArrange is called with an example array [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]. The returned result is printed to the console using fmt.Println.

The expected output of this code is 3, as the largest index of an element that is not greater than or equal
