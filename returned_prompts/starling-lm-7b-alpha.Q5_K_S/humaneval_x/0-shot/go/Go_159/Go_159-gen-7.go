To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of carrots eaten by adding the number of carrots already eaten (`number`) to the number of carrots needed to be eaten (`need`). This gives us the value of `totalEaten`.
2. Subtract the total number of carrots eaten (`totalEaten`) from the remaining carrots (`remaining`). This gives us the number of carrots left after the meal (`carrotsLeft`).
3. If the number of carrots left after the meal (`carrotsLeft`) is less than zero, it means that the rabbit ate all the remaining carrots. In this case, set `carrotsLeft` to zero.
4. Return an array containing the total number of carrots eaten (`totalEaten`) and the number of carrots left after the meal (`carrotsLeft`).

Here's the code to implement the solution:

```go
func Eat(number, need, remaining int) []int {
    totalEaten := number + need
    carrotsLeft := remaining - totalEaten
    if carrotsLeft < 0 {
        carrotsLeft = 0
    }
    return []int{totalEaten, carrotsLeft}
}
```

By following these steps, we can calculate the total number of carrots eaten and the number of carrots left after the meal.

Note: The constraints mentioned in the problem (`0 <= number <= 1000`, `0 <= need <= 1000`, `0 <= remaining <= 1000`) ensure that the values are within the valid range.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func Eat(number, need, remaining int) []int {
    totalEaten := number + need
    carrotsLeft := remaining - totalEaten
    if carrotsLeft < 0 {
        carrotsLeft = 0
    }
    return []int{totalEaten, carrotsLeft}
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println
