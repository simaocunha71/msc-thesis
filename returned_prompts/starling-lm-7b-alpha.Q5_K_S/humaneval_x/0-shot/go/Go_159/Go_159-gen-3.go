To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of carrots eaten by adding the number of carrots already eaten (`number`) to the number of carrots that need to be eaten (`need`).
2. Calculate the number of carrots left after eating by subtracting the total number of carrots eaten from the remaining number of carrots (`remaining`). If the result is less than 0, it means that there are not enough carrots left to satisfy the need, so you should eat all the remaining carrots and set the number of carrots left to 0.
3. Return the array containing the total number of carrots eaten and the number of carrots left after eating.

Here's the implementation of the solution in Go:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func Eat(number, need, remaining int) []int {
    total := number + need
    left := remaining - total
    if left < 0 {
        left = 0
    }
    return []int{total, left}
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(Eat(5, 6, 10)) // [11, 4]
    fmt.Println(Eat(4, 8, 9)) // [12, 1]
    fmt.Println(Eat(1, 10, 10)) // [11, 0]
    fmt.Println(Eat(2, 11, 5)) // [7, 0]
}
```

This code defines a function `Eat` that takes three integer arguments: `number`, `need`, and `remaining`. It calculates the total number of carrots eaten by adding the number of carrots already eaten (`number`) to the number of carrots that need to be eaten (`need`). It then calculates the number of carrots left after eating by subtracting the total number of carrots eaten from the remaining number of carrots (`remaining`). If the result is less than 0, it means that there are not enough carrots left to satisfy the need, so you should eat
