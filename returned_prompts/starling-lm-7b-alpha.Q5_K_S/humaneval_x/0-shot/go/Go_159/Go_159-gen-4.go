To solve this problem, we can calculate the total number of carrots eaten and the number of remaining carrots.
Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize a variable "totalCarrotsEaten" to store the total number of carrots eaten, initially set to the value of "number".
2. Initialize a variable "remainingCarrots" to store the remaining number of carrots, initially set to the value of "remaining".
3. If the remaining carrots are less than the number of carrots needed to be eaten, subtract the remaining carrots from "totalCarrotsEaten" and set "remainingCarrots" to 0.
4. Subtract the number of carrots needed to be eaten from the remaining carrots and add the result to "totalCarrotsEaten". If the remaining carrots are less than the number of carrots needed to be eaten, set "remainingCarrots" to 0.
5. Return the array [totalCarrotsEaten, remainingCarrots].

Here's the code implementation:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func Eat(number, need, remaining int) []int {
	totalCarrotsEaten := number
	remainingCarrots := remaining

	if remainingCarrots < need {
		totalCarrotsEaten += remainingCarrots
		remainingCarrots = 0
	} else {
		totalCarrotsEaten += need
		remainingCarrots -= need
	}

	return []int{totalCarrotsEaten, remainingCarrots}
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(Eat(5, 6, 10)) // [11, 4]
	fmt.Println(Eat(4, 8, 9)) // [12, 1]
	fmt.Println(Eat(1, 10, 10)) // [11, 0]
	fmt.Println(Eat(2, 11, 5)) // [7, 0]
}
```
