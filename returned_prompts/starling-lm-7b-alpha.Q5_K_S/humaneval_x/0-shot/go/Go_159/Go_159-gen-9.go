To solve this problem, you need to subtract the number of carrots you have Eaten from the total number of carrots you need to Eat. If the result is greater than the number of remaining carrots, you should Eat all the remaining carrots and return the number of Eaten carrots and the remaining carrots.
Here's a step-by-step guide on how to solve this problem:

1. Calculate the remaining carrots by subtracting the Eaten carrots from the total number of carrots needed: remainingCarrots = need - number
2. If the remaining carrots are less than 0, it means there are not enough carrots left to Eat. In this case, Eat all the remaining carrots and return the Eaten carrots and the remaining carrots.
3. If the remaining carrots are greater than or equal to 0, add the Eaten carrots to the remaining carrots and return the Eaten carrots and the remaining carrots.
4. Finally, return the result as an array of [total Eaten carrots, remaining carrots].

Here's a Python implementation of the solution:

def Eat(number, need, remaining):
    remainingCarrots = need - number
    if remainingCarrots < 0:
        return [number + remaining, 0]
    else:
        return [number + remaining, remainingCarrots]

You can use this function to calculate the total number of Eaten carrots and the remaining carrots based on the input values.

Here's an example usage of the function:

print(Eat(5, 6, 10))  # Output: [11, 4]
print(Eat(4, 8, 9))  # Output: [12, 1]
print(Eat(1, 10, 10))  # Output: [11, 0]
print(Eat(2, 11, 5))  # Output: [7, 0]

The function will return the total Eaten carrots and the remaining carrots as a list.
