The `CircularShift` function takes an integer `x` and an integer `shift` as input and returns a string as output.

First, the function converts the integer `x` to a slice of strings called `a` by repeatedly taking the modulo of `x` by 10 and appending the result to `a`. This process continues until `x` becomes 0.

Next, the function checks if the value of `shift` is greater than the length of `a`. If it is, the function performs a circular shift to the left by swapping the last element of `a` with the first element, and then shifting all other elements to the right. This effectively reverses the order of the elements in `a`.

If the value of `shift` is not greater than the length of `a`, the function performs a circular shift to the right by taking the element at index `len(a)-shift` and assigning it to index `i` in `a`, for all values of `i` from `len(a)-shift` to `len(a)-1`.

Finally, the function uses the `strings.Join` function to concatenate all the elements of `a` into a single string, and returns the resulting string as the output of the function.

Overall, this implementation provides a way to circularly shift the digits of an integer to the right by a specified number of positions, while also handling cases where the shift exceeds
