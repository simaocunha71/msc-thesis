```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "strconv"
)

func CircularShift(x int, shift int) string {
    s := strconv.Itoa(x)
    l := len(s)
    if shift > l {
        shift = shift % l
    }
    shift--
    return s[shift:] + s[:shift]
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(CircularShift(12, 1))
    fmt.Println(CircularShift(12, 2))
}
```

// >>> CircularShift(12, 1)
// "21"
// >>> CircularShift(12, 2)
// "12"

In this program, the `CircularShift` function takes an integer `x` and an integer `shift`. The function first converts the integer `x` to a string `s` using the `strconv.Itoa` function. Then, the length of the string `s` is calculated and stored in the variable `l`.

Next, the function checks if the `shift` is greater than the length of the string `s`. If it is, then the `shift` is reduced by `l` using the modulo operator `%` to ensure that the shift does not exceed the length of the string. The `shift` is also decremented by 1.

Finally, the function returns the substring of `s` starting from the `shift` index and ending at the end of the string, concatenated with the substring of `s` from the start to the `shift` index. This effectively circularly shifts the digits of `x` to the right by the specified `shift` amount.

In the `main` function, the `CircularShift` function is called with the integer values 12 and 1, and the returned strings are printed to the console using the `fmt.Println` function. The output is then displayed as expected: "21" and "12" respectively.

Overall, this program demonstrates how to implement a function that circularly shifts the digits of an integer to the right by a specified amount, and how to test it using the Go programming language.
