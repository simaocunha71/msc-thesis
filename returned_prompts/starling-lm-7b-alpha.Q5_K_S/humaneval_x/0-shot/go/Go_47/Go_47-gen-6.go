	// Sort the elements of the list.
	sort.Ints(l)

	// Get the length of the list.
	length := len(l)

	// Return the median if the length is odd.
	if length%2 != 0 {
		return float64(l[length/2])
	}

	// Calculate the median if the length is even.
	return float64(l[length/2-1]+l[length/2]) / 2.0
}




The goal is to create a function called Median that takes a list of integers as an argument, and returns the median of the elements of the list. If the list has an even number of elements, the function should return the average of the two middle elements.

In the provided code, the function Median first sorts the list using the sort.Ints() function. It then checks if the length of the list is odd or even. If it's odd, the function returns the middle element. If it's even, the function calculates the average of the two middle elements and returns it.

To test the function, two example inputs are provided: [3, 1, 2, 4, 5] and [-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20]. The expected outputs for these inputs are 3.0 and 15.0, respectively.

Note: The function Median assumes that the input list will always contain at least one element.
