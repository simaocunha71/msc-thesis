I'm having trouble with this problem. I'm confused about the "if length%2 == 0" and "if length%2 != 0" parts in the code.

It seems that the if statement checks if the length of the list is even or odd, but I don't understand why this is necessary.

Also, the sort.Ints(l) function is used to sort the list, but I don't understand why it's necessary either.

Could you explain these two points to me, please?

The "if length%2 == 0" and "if length%2 != 0" are used to determine if the length of the list is even or odd. This is important because the median of an even number of elements is the average of the two middle elements, while the median of an odd number of elements is the middle element.

The sort.Ints(l) function is used to sort the list in ascending order. This is necessary because the median is the middle value of a sorted list. Without sorting the list, it would be difficult to determine the median.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. The sort.Ints(l) function is called to sort the list in ascending order.
2. The length of the list is checked using the len() function.
3. If the length of the list is 0, the function returns 0.0 because there are no elements in the list.
4. If the length of the list is even (i.e., length%2 == 0), the median is calculated by taking the average of the two middle elements. The two middle elements are the elements at indices length/2-1 and length/2.
5. If the length of the list is odd (i.e., length%2 != 0), the median is simply the middle
