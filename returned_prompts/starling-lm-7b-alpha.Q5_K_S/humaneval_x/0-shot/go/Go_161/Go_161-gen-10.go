Explanation:
The function takes a string s as a parameter and initializes a slice of runes called `runeSlice` with the elements of the string.
It then iterates over each element of the rune slice using the `range` keyword.
Inside the loop, it checks if the current element is a lowercase letter (between 'a' and 'z') using the `>=` and `<=` operators. If it is, it converts the letter to its uppercase equivalent by subtracting the ASCII value of 'a' and adding the ASCII value of 'A'. If the current element is an uppercase letter (between 'A' and 'Z'), it does the opposite, converting it to a lowercase letter.
Finally, it converts the slice of runes back to a string and returns the resulting string.

Examples:
- `Solve("1234")` returns "4321"
- `Solve("ab")` returns "AB"
- `Solve("#a@C")` returns "#A@c"

The solution correctly reverses the case of all the letters in the string, while leaving the non-letter characters unchanged.

In the provided code, the function `Solve` takes a string `s` as input and converts it into a slice of runes called `runeSlice`. It then iterates over each element of the slice using the `range` keyword. Inside the loop, it checks if the current element
