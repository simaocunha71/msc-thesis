FilterIntegers := func(values []interface{}) []int {
    var result []int
    for _, v := range values {
        if _, ok := v.(int); ok {
            result = append(result, v.(int))
        }
    }
    return result
}

This function creates a new slice called "result" to store the integers found in the original slice. It then iterates through each value in the original slice using a range loop. Inside the loop, it checks if the current value is of type int by using a type assertion and a boolean variable called "ok". If the type assertion is successful, meaning the value is indeed an integer, it appends the value to the "result" slice. Finally, the function returns the "result" slice containing only the integers found in the original slice.

To use the function, you can call it with a list of values and pass it as an argument. For example, if you want to filter the integers from the list ['a', 3.14, 5], you can call the function like this:

FilterIntegers(['a', 3.14, 5])

The function will return a new slice containing only the integer values from the original list:

[5]

Similarly, if you want to filter the integers from the list [1, 2, 3, 'abc', {}], you can call the function like this:

FilterIntegers([1, 2, 3, 'abc', {}])

The function will return a new slice containing only the integer values from the original list:

[1, 2, 3]

Overall, the FilterIntegers function provides a convenient way to filter out non-integer values from a given list of values and return a new slice with only the integer values.

The provided solution uses a type assertion with a boolean variable called "ok" to check if a value is of type int. The type assertion allows you to check the type of a value at runtime and perform operations based on its type. In this case, it is used to determine if a value is an integer or not.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. Define the FilterIntegers function, which takes a slice of interface values as an argument.
