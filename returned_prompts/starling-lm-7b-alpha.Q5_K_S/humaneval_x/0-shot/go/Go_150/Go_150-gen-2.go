// This program will not compile because it does not have a return
// statement at every point in the code. It only returns a value in
// the XOrY function, which means that it should only be called if the
// function is needed.

The reason for this is that the function should return a result,
not just print one. So, if you only want to print something, then
you should not call the function at all. Instead, you should use
the `fmt.Println` function to print the result of the function.

Here's a modified version of the code that compiles correctly:

```go
func XOrY(n, x, y int) int {
    if n <= 1 {
        return y
    }
    for i := 2; i < n; i++ {
        if n%i == 0 {
            return y
        }
    }
    return x
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(XOrY(7, 34, 12))
    fmt.Println(XOrY(15, 8, 5))
}
```

This code will print the result of the XOrY function for the given arguments.
