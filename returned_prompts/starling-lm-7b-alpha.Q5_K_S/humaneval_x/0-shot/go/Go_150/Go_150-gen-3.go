The answer is: No, the function does not always return the value of x if n is a prime number, and the value of y otherwise. In some cases, it returns the value of y even if n is a prime number. Here's an example:

```go
func XOrY(n, x, y int) int {
    // Initialize result
    var result int

    // Check if n is a prime number
    for i := 2; i < n; i++ {
        if n%i == 0 {
            result = y
            break
        }
    }

    if result == 0 {
        result = x ^ y
    } else {
        result = y
    }

    return result
}
```

This function checks if `n` is a prime number by iterating from `2` to `n-1` and checking if `n` is divisible by any number in that range. If `n` is divisible by any number, it means `n` is not a prime number, and the function assigns the value of `y` to the `result` variable and breaks out of the loop. If `n` is not divisible by any number, it means `n` is a prime number, and the function assigns the value of `x ^ y` to the `result` variable.

However, the function does not always return the value of `x` if `n` is a prime number and the value of `y` otherwise. In some cases, it returns the value of `y` even if `n` is a prime number. For example, if `
