```
    n++
    if n%2 == 0 {
        return y
    } else {
        return x
    }
```

This code is incorrect because the condition `n%2 == 0` is used to check if a number is even, but the problem asks to check if the number is prime. A prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself. So, a prime number cannot be even as it is divisible by 2.

To fix the code, you can use the following code:

```
func XOrY(n, x, y int) int {
    isPrime := true

    for i := 2; i < n; i++ {
        if n % i == 0 {
            isPrime = false
            break
        }
    }

    if isPrime {
        return x
    } else {
        return y
    }
}
```

In this code, we iterate from 2 to `n-1` to check if `n` is divisible by any number in this range. If `n` is divisible by any number, then it is not a prime number and the `isPrime` flag is set to `false`. If the loop completes without finding any divisors, then `n` is a prime number and the `isPrime` flag is set to `true`. Finally, we return the value of `x` if `isPrime` is `true` and the value of `y` if `isPrime` is `false`.

This code correctly checks if a number is prime and returns the value of `x` if it is prime and the value of `y` otherwise.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func XOrY(n, x, y int) int {
    isPrime := true

    for i := 2; i < n; i++ {
        if n % i == 0 {
            isPrime = false
            break
        }
    }

    if isPrime {
        return x
    } else {
        return y
    }
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(XOrY(7,
