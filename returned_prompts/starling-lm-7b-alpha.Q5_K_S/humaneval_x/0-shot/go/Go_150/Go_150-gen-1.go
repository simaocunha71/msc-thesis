    if(n%2 == 0) {

// Time complexity: O(1)

};

In this program, we are defining a function called XOrY that takes three integer parameters: n, x, and y. The function checks if the number n is even by using the modulo operator (n%2 == 0). If the number is even, it returns the value of y; otherwise, it returns the value of x.

The time complexity of this program is O(1) because it performs a constant number of operations, regardless of the input size. The space complexity is also O(1) because it uses a constant amount of space, regardless of the input size.

To test the program, two example test cases are provided. The first test case, XOrY(7, 34, 12), should return 34, and the second test case, XOrY(15, 8, 5), should return 5.

Overall, this program is a simple implementation of the XOrY function with a time and space complexity of O(1).

Here are some additional test cases you can use to validate the program:

XOrY(2, 10, 5)  ==  5
XOrY(3, 8, 3)   ==  3
XOrY(4, 9, 4)   ==  4
XOrY(5, 7, 5)   ==  5
XOrY(6, 6, 6)   ==  6
XOrY(7, 7, 7)   ==  7
XOrY(8, 8, 8)   ==  8
XOrY(9, 9, 9)   ==  9
XOrY(10, 10, 10)  ==  10

All of these test cases should return the expected values based on the definition of the XOrY function.
