func IsEqualToSumEven(n int) bool {
    if n < 8 {
        return false
    }
    return n%4 == 0 && n%8 == 0
}

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. We start by checking if the given number `n` is less than 8. If it is, we return false immediately because it is impossible to write a number less than 8 as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers.

2. If `n` is 8 or greater, we check if `n` is divisible by 4 and 8. If it is, we return true because it is possible to write `n` as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. For example, 8 can be written as 4 + 2 + 2 + 0, and 12 can be written as 8 + 4 + 0 + 0.

3. If `n` is not divisible by 4 and 8, it is impossible to write it as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. Therefore, we return false.

In summary, the solution checks if the given number `n` is divisible by 4 and 8 to determine if it can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers.
