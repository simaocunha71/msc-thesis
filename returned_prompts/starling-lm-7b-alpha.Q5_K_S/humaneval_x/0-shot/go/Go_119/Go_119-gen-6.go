// In order for the string to be good, it must have the same amount of open
// and close parentheses. This can be determined by summing the length of
// each string, and if the sum is odd, then return 'No'.
	sum := 0
	for _, v := range lst {
		sum += len(v)
	}
	if sum%2 != 0 {
		return "No"
	}
	return "Yes"
}

This code has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the length of the input
string.
