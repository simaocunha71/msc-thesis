To solve this Kata, you need to understand how to find the total number of characters in a string in Go. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. Initialize a counter variable to keep track of the total number of characters.
2. Use a for loop to iterate through each string in the first list.
3. Inside the loop, add the length of each string to the counter variable.
4. After the loop, compare the counter variable with the total number of characters in the second list. If it's less, return the first list. If it's greater, return the second list. If they're equal, return the first list.
5. If both lists are empty, return an empty list.

Here's an example implementation in Go:

```go
func TotalMatch(lst1 []string, lst2 []string) []string {
    counter := 0
    for _, s := range lst1 {
        counter += len(s)
    }
    if counter < len(lst2) {
        return lst1
    } else if counter == len(lst2) {
        return lst1
    } else {
        return lst2
    }
}
```

You can test the function with the provided examples:

```go
fmt.Println(TotalMatch([]string{}, []string{})) // []
fmt.Println(TotalMatch([]string{"hi", "admin"}, []string{"hI", "Hi"})) // [hI Hi]
fmt.Println(TotalMatch([]string{"hi", "admin"}, []string{"hi", "hi", "admin", "project"})) // [hi admin]
fmt.Println(TotalMatch([]string{"hi", "admin"}, []string{"hI", "hi", "hi"})) // [hI hi hi]
fmt.Println(TotalMatch([]string{"4"}, []string{"1", "2", "3", "4", "5"})) // [4]
```

The function will return the list with fewer characters in total, or the first list if the total number of characters is the same in both lists. If both lists are empty, it will return an empty list.

Note: In Go, the range keyword is used to iterate over
