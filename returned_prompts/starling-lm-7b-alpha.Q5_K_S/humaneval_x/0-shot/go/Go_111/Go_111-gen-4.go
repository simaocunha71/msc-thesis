I'm wondering if the Histogram function can be optimized to reduce time complexity or memory usage.

Answer:

The time complexity of the Histogram function is O(n) and the space complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because we have to traverse the entire string once to count the occurrence of each character, and we need to store the result in a map, which has a time complexity of O(1) for insertion and lookup. 

The current implementation already has a good time and space complexity, as it uses a map to store the occurrence count of each character in a single pass through the string. The use of a map allows for constant time complexity for insertion and lookup, which is optimal for this problem. 

To optimize the Histogram function further, we can consider using a different data structure or algorithm. However, it's important to note that the current implementation is already quite efficient. 

One possible optimization is to use a slice instead of a map to store the occurrence count of each character. This would reduce the space complexity to O(n) from O(n^2), as we would only need to allocate space for the occurrence count of each character, rather than allocating space for each character and its corresponding count. However, this optimization would come at the cost of increased time complexity, as we would need to traverse the string twice to count the occurrence of each character.

Here's an example of how to implement the Histogram function using a slice instead of a map:

```go
func Histogram(test string) []int {
    histogram := make([]int, 26)

    for _, c := range test {
        histogram[c-'a']++
