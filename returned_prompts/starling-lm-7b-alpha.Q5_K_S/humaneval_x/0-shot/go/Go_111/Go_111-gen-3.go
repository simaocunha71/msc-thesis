I'm trying to solve this problem but I can't figure out why my function is not working. Could you help me understand why?

As you can see in the problem, the function `Histogram` must return a map of lowercase letters as keys and the number of times they occur as values.

To solve the problem, you can use a `map` to store the letters as keys and their respective counts as values. Then, iterate through the input string, converting each character to a rune and incrementing its count in the map. Finally, return the map.

In the provided solution, the `Histogram` function takes a string `test` as input and initializes an empty map `m`. Then, it iterates through each rune in the `test` string using the `range` keyword. For each rune, it increments its count in the map `m` using the `m[v]++` syntax.

After the loop, the function returns the map `m` which contains the lowercase letters as keys and their respective counts as values.

The code you provided seems correct and should work as expected. However, if you are experiencing issues with it, it might be due to a different problem in your code that is not related to the `Histogram` function. Make sure you are calling the `Histogram` function correctly and passing the appropriate input string to it.

Here's an example of how to use the `Histogram` function:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println(Histogram("a b c")) // Output: map[a:1 b:1 c:1]
    fmt.Println(Histogram("a b b a")) // Output: map[a:2 b:2]
    fmt.Println(Histogram("a b c a b")) // Output: map[a:2 b:2]
    fmt.Println(Histogram("b b b b a")) // Output: map[b:4]
    fmt.Println(Histogram("")) // Output: map[]
}
