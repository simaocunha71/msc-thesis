The `range` keyword in Go is used to iterate over a collection. The collection can be a slice, an array, a string, or a map.

Here it is being used to iterate over a string.

The syntax of the `range` keyword is as follows:

```go
for range collection {
    // Code to be executed for each iteration
}
```

The `range` keyword returns two values from the collection. The first value is the index of the current element, and the second value is the element itself.

In your case, the `range` keyword is used to iterate over the `test` string. For each character in the string, the index and value are assigned to the variables `i` and `v` respectively. The `_` is a blank identifier, which means that the value of `i` is being ignored.

Here's a breakdown of the `for _, v := range test` line:

- `for`: Starts the loop.
- `_, v :=`: The `_` is a blank identifier, which means that the value of `i` is being ignored. `v` is the variable that will hold the value of each character in the string.
- `range test`: The `range` keyword is used to iterate over the `test` string. For each character in the string, the index and value are assigned to the variables `i` and `v` respectively.

Here's an example to demonstrate how the `range` keyword works with a string:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    test := "Hello, World!"
    for _, v := range test {
        fmt.Println(v)
    }
}
```

This code will output the following
