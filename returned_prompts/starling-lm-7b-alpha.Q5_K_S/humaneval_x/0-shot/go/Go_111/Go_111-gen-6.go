    counter := make(map[rune]int)
    r := []rune(test)
    for _, v := range r {
        counter[v]++
    }
    return counter
}

I'm confused about the part "counter[v]++". How does it increment the value of counter[v] if it is a map?

In Go, maps are indexed by key-value pairs. The keys must be of type comparable (e.g. int, string), while the values can be of arbitrary types.

The "counter[v]++" in your code increments the value of the key v in the map counter. It is equivalent to "counter[v] = counter[v] + 1".

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the code works:

1. You create an empty map called counter using the make() function. This map will store the letters of the input string as keys and their corresponding counts as values.

2. You convert the input string into a slice of runes using the []rune() conversion function. This is necessary because maps in Go can only store key-value pairs where both keys and values are comparable. Rune is a type that represents a Unicode code point, which is comparable.

3. You iterate over each rune in the slice r using a for loop. For each rune, you assign it to the variable v.

4. Inside the loop, you increment the value of the key v in the map counter by 1 using the "counter[v]++" statement. This is achieved by assigning the value of counter[v] + 1 to counter[v]. Since maps in Go are implemented as reference types, this operation modifies the value of counter[v] in place.

5. After the loop finishes, you return the map counter, which now contains the histogram of the input string.

In summary, the "counter[v]++" statement increments the value of the key v in the map counter by 1, effectively counting the occurrences of each letter in the input string.

Here's an example to illustrate how this works:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    test := "a b c a
