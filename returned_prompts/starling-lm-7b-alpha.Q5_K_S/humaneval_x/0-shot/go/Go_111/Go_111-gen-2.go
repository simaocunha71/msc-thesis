I'm not sure if my code is correct. I'm getting the error "cannot use _ as range index"

I'm using Go Playground and I'm not sure if that's the problem.

Here is the link to my code on Go Playground: http://play.golang.org/p/f4B4jS3Dt_

You can't use the `_` blank identifier in a `range` clause. In fact, you don't need to use `range` at all here, since you're not using the index. Here's a modified version of your function that should work:

```go
func Histogram(test string) map[rune]int {
    m := make(map[rune]int)
    for _, v := range test {
        m[v]++
    }
    return m
}
```

I apologize for the confusion; this was my first post here.

Here is a related question that I have:

How can I find the maximum value in a map and return its key?

Here is an example of the problem:

```
m := make(map[rune]int)
m['a'] = 1
m['b'] = 2
m['c'] = 3
```

I would like to find the maximum value and return its key.

To find the maximum value in a map, you can use the `max` function from the `container/heap` package, which works on any ordered type, including `map[Key]Value`. Here's an example of how you can use it:

```go
import (
    "container/heap"
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    m := make(map[rune]int)
    m['a'] = 1
    m['b'] = 2
    m['
