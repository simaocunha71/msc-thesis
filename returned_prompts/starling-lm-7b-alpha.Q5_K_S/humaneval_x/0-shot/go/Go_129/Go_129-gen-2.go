// We can construct a min heap to store the cells with min distance to the source
// and keep popping the cell with min distance until we find k cells. Then we can
// output the path by following the path from the source.

Since we can start from any cell, we can start from all the cells and pop the
cells from the min heap as long as we haven't found k cells yet.

In the end, we will return the path with all the values from the cells popped
from the min heap.

Here is the step by step walk through of the solution:

1. Construct a min heap and push all the cells from the grid.
2. While the length of the min heap is greater than k, pop a cell from the min
   heap.
3. For each cell, push its neighbors to the min heap if they haven't been pushed
   yet.
4. Once the while loop is over, return the values from the min heap.

Time complexity: O(N * N + K * log(N * N))

Space complexity: O(N * N)

Here is the implementation of the solution in Go:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sort"
)

type Cell struct {
	val  int
	dist int
}

func Minpath(grid [][]int, k int) []int {
	cells := make([]Cell, 0)
	for i := 0; i < len(grid); i++ {
		for j := 0; j < len(grid[i]); j++ {
			cells = append(cells, Cell{grid[i][j], 0})
		}
	}

	sort.Slice(cells, func(i, j int) bool {
		return cells[i].dist < cells[j].dist
	})

	minHeap := make([]Cell, 0)
	for _, cell := range cells {
		minHeap = append(minHeap, cell)
	}

	path := make([]int, 0)
	for len(minHeap) > k {
		cell := minHeap[0]
		minHeap = minHeap[1:
