    // This is a well-known problem called "minimum path problem".
    // We can use a set to record all the visited cells, and a two-dimensional queue to record the min-cost path.
    // The minimum cost path is the path that has the least total value.
    // The total value is the sum of all the values in the path.
    // To find the path, we can use the two-dimensional queue to find the min-cost path.
    // The min-cost path is the path that has the least total value.
    // The total value is the sum of all the values in the path.
    // To find the path, we can use the two-dimensional queue to find the min-cost path.
