To solve this problem, we can use a bfs (breadth-first search) traversal starting from each cell of the grid.
We will mark the visited cells and keep track of the minimum path length and the corresponding path.

First, we initialize the minPath as an empty slice of integers and the minPathLength as a large value.
Then, we iterate through each cell of the grid using nested loops.
For each cell, we start a bfs traversal using the cell as the starting point.
We mark the starting cell as visited and add it to the minPath.
We also calculate the length of the minPath and check if it is less than the minPathLength.
If it is, we update the minPath and minPathLength.
Finally, we return the minPath.

Note: The bfs traversal is implemented using a queue.
We enqueue the starting cell and keep dequeuing the front cell until the queue is empty.
For each dequeued cell, we check if it is a neighbor of the starting cell.
If it is, we mark it as visited and add it to the minPath.
We also enqueue the neighbor cell if it is not marked as visited.

Here is the code for the solution:

```go
func Minpath(grid [][]int, k int) []int {
    minPath := []int{}
    minPathLength := math.MaxInt32

    for i := 0; i < len(grid); i++ {
        for j := 0; j < len(grid[i]); j++ {
            bfs(grid, i, j, k, &minPath, &minPathLength)
        }
    }

    return minPath
}

func bfs(grid [][]int, i, j int, k int, minPath *[]int, minPathLength *int) {
    queue := [][]int{{i, j}}
    marked := make(map[int]bool)
    marked[i*len(grid[0]) + j] = true
    (*minPath) = append((*minPath), grid[i][j])

    for len(queue) > 0 {
        curr := queue[0]
        queue = queue[1:]
