This is a hard one to understand.

I understand that the grid is N x N, and all values from 1 to N^2 are present exactly once in the grid. The path is of length k and the path should be lexicographically smallest.

The solution provided is a bit complex. However, in the end it's a greedy solution. The algorithm is as follows:

1. Create a map of all numbers that are in the grid and their respective locations. This is done in O(N^2) time complexity.
2. Sort the map.
3. Find the smallest path in the grid based on the sorted map. This is done in O(N^2) time complexity.
4. Return the path.

The time complexity of the solution is O(N^2 + K). The space complexity of the solution is O(N^2).

I believe this solution can be optimized.

Here's a better solution:

1. Create a map of all numbers that are in the grid and their respective locations. This is done in O(N^2) time complexity.
2. Sort the map.
3. Start from the smallest number in the sorted map. In the grid, find the smallest path based on the sorted map. This is done in O(N) time complexity.
4. Return the path.

The time complexity of the solution is O(N^2). The space complexity of the solution is O(N^2).

Here's a code example of the solution:

```go
func Minpath(grid [][]int, k int) []int {
    m := make(map[int][][2]int)
    for i := 0; i < len(grid); i++ {
        for j := 0; j < len(grid[i]); j++ {
            m[grid[i][j]] = [2]int{i, j}
        }
    }
    sort(m)
    p := []int{}
    for _, v := range m {
        if len(p)+len(v)-1 == k {
            p = append(p, v[0]...)
            break
        }
        if len(p)+len(v)-1 > k {
            continue
        }
