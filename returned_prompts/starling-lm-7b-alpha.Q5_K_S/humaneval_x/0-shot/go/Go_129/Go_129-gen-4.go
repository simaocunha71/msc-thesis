This is an interesting problem, as it involves a path of length k, and we can't use a simple bfs or dfs to find the shortest path.

First, we can use a bfs to find all the possible paths of length k, and store their values in a map. Then, we can use a dfs to find the shortest path from the map.

Here's a detailed step-by-step solution:

1. Create a map to store all the possible paths of length k, with the path values as keys and the path lengths as values.

2. Use a bfs to find all the possible paths of length k. For each path, we need to find the path length and the path values. We can do this by starting from the first cell of the grid, and then moving to the neighbor cells until we reach the last cell of the path. We need to keep track of the path length and the path values as we move.

3. Once we have found all the possible paths of length k, we can use a dfs to find the shortest path from the map. We can start from the first path in the map, and then move to the neighbor paths until we reach the last path. We need to keep track of the path length and the path values as we move.

4. Finally, we can return the shortest path from the dfs.

Here's a detailed step-by-step solution in Go:

```go
func minPath(grid [][]int, k int) []int {
    m := make(map[int]int)
    bfs(grid, k, m)
    dfs(grid, k, m)
    return res
}

func bfs(grid [][]int, k int, m map[int]int) {
    q := make([][]int, 0)
    q = append(q, grid[:])
    for i := 0; i < len(q); i++ {
        cur := q[i]
        if len(cur) == k {
            m[curToInt(cur)] = len(cur)
        } else {
            for j := 0; j < len(cur); j++ {
                if j > 0 && cur[j-1] == cur[
