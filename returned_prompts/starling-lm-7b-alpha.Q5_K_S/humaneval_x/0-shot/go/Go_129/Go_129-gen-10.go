Here are some insights that helped me to solve this problem:

1. The path of length k must start from a cell that has the minimum value.
2. For any given cell, the possible next cell is unique.
3. When we have two paths with same length and same starting cell, and one path
   has the minimum value in the first step, we should choose the one with the minimum
   value in the first step, because the path with the minimum value in the first step
   will have the minimum value in more steps.
4. When we have two paths with same starting cell, same path length, and same starting
   step value, we should choose the one with minimum step number, because the path with
   minimum step number will have the minimum value in more steps.

Here's my solution:

First, we find all cells that have the minimum value, and select the one with the minimum step number.
Then, we find all possible next cells from the selected cell, and select the one with the minimum value.
We continue this process until we find a path with length k.

Here's the detailed step-by-step solution in Python:

```python
def minpath(grid, k):
    n = len(grid)
    min_value = min(min(row) for row in grid)
    min_cell = None
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if grid[i][j] == min_value:
                min_cell = (i, j)
                break
    if k == 1:
        return [min_value]
    next_min_cells = []
    for (i, j) in [(i + 1, j), (i - 1, j), (i, j + 1), (i, j - 1)]:
        if 0 <= i < n and 0 <= j < n:
            next_min_cells.append((i, j))
    path = [min_value]
    while len(path) < k:
        min_cell = next_min_cells[0]
        for (i, j) in next_min_cells:
            if grid[i][j] < grid[min
