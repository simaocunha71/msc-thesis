This problem can be reduced to the problem of finding the minimum path in a grid with some of the cells marked as obstacles. We can use the approach of using a set to keep track of the unvisited cells, and then using a set to keep track of the visited cells. We can also use a priority queue to keep track of the minimum distance to the unvisited cells.

Here is an example of how to solve this problem:

```go
func minPath(grid [][]int, k int) []int {
    rows := len(grid)
    cols := len(grid[0])
    dists := make([][]int, rows)
    for i := range dists {
        dists[i] = make([]int, cols)
        for j := range dists[i] {
            dists[i][j] = -1
        }
    }
    unvisited := make(map[pair]int)
    for i := 0; i < rows; i++ {
        for j := 0; j < cols; j++ {
            unvisited[pair(i, j)] = 0
        }
    }
    visited := make(map[pair]int)
    pq := make([]pair, 0)
    for i := 0; i < rows; i++ {
        for j := 0; j < cols; j++ {
            if unvisited[pair(i, j)] > 0 {
                pq = append(pq, pair(i, j))
            }
        }
    }
    for len(pq) > 0 {
        cur := heappop(&pq)
        if visited[cur] > 0 {
            continue
        }
        visited[cur] = 1
        if len(pq) == 0 {
            break
        }
        for _, c := range cur.neighbors() {
            if visited[c] > 0 {
                continue
            }
            if dists[c.row][c.col] == -1 {
                dists[c.row][c.col] = dists[cur.row][cur.col] + 1
