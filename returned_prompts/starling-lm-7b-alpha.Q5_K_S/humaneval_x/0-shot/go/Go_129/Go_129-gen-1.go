// The key to this problem is to realize that the path is always in the clockwise
// direction. So we can start at any cell and follow the path in a clockwise
// direction until the path length is k.

Here's a step-by-step walkthrough of the solution:

1. Create a set to store all the visited cells.
2. Create a queue to store the cells to visit.
3. Push the starting cell to the queue.
4. While the queue is not empty, pop a cell from the queue and add it to the visited set.
5. Push the neighboring cells of the popped cell to the queue if they haven't been visited.
6. Once the queue is empty, the visited set should contain all the cells in the minimum path.
7. Sort the cells in the minimum path by their values in lexicographic order.
8. Return the sorted list of values.

Here's a Python implementation of the solution:

```python
from collections import deque

def minpath(grid, k):
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([(0, 0)])
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        visited.add((x, y))
        for dx, dy in ((0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)):
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < len(grid) and 0 <= ny < len(grid[0]) and (nx, ny) not in visited:
                queue.append((nx, ny))
    return sorted([grid[x][y] for x, y in visited[:k]])
```

This implementation has a time complexity of O(N^2 + K), where N is the number of rows (or columns) in the grid and K is the length of the path. The space complexity is O(N^2), where N is the number of rows (or columns) in the grid.

Note: This implementation assumes that the grid is a 2D array (or list of lists) of integers and that the indices start at 0.

You can use this implementation in your code to find the minimum path of length
