Explanation:

The function RescaleToUnit takes in a list of numbers and applies a linear transform to that list,
such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1.

To do this, we first find the minimum and maximum values in the input list using a for loop and the math.MaxValue and 0.0 variables.
We then calculate the delta, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum values.
Next, we create a new slice called res with the same length as the input list, and initialize all elements to 0.
Finally, we iterate over the input list again, and for each element, we calculate the rescaled value by subtracting the minimum from the element and dividing it by the delta.
We store the rescaled value in the res slice at the corresponding index.

The function returns the res slice, which now contains the rescaled values of the input list.

Example usage:

numbers := []float64{1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0}
rescaledNumbers := RescaleToUnit(numbers)
fmt.Println(rescaledNumbers) // Output: [0 0.25 0.5 0.75 1]
