To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Find the minimum and maximum values in the slice.
2. Subtract the minimum from all values in the slice, and divide the result by the maximum value minus the minimum.
3. Apply the transformation to the slice.

Here's a possible implementation of the function:

```go
func RescaleToUnit(numbers []float64) []float64 {
    min := math.MaxValue
    max := math.MinValue
    for _, num := range numbers {
        if num < min {
            min = num
        }
        if num > max {
            max = num
        }
    }
    rescaled := make([]float64, len(numbers))
    for i, num := range numbers {
        rescaled[i] = (num - min) / (max - min)
    }
    return rescaled
}
```

This function first initializes the minimum and maximum variables with positive infinity and negative infinity, respectively. Then, it iterates through the numbers slice, updating the min and max values if necessary. After that, it creates a new slice called rescaled with the same length as the input slice. The function then iterates through the numbers slice again, applying the transformation to each element, and stores the result in the rescaled slice. Finally, the function returns the rescaled slice.

It's important to note that the min and max variables are updated within the same loop that iterates through the numbers slice. This is possible because the for loop variable, _, is not used, allowing the loop to reassign the variable to new values in each iteration.

In the provided example, the RescaleToUnit function is called with the numbers [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]. The function first determines that the minimum value is 1.0 and the maximum value is 5.0. Then, it applies the transformation to each number in the slice, resulting in the output [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0].

Overall, this solution effectively rescales a list of numbers so that the smallest value becomes 0
