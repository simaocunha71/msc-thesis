// RescaleToUnit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]) [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]

This function works by calculating the minimum and maximum values from the input list, then calculating the difference between each number in the list and the minimum value. It then divides this difference by the difference between the maximum and minimum values, effectively scaling the numbers to the range [0,1].

The function checks if the length of the input list is less than or equal to 1. If it is, it simply returns the input list as is, as there is no need to perform any scaling.

The function initializes the result slice with the same length as the input slice. It then iterates over each number in the input slice and calculates the scaled value using the formula (v - min) / (max - min), where v is the current number, min is the minimum value calculated earlier, and max is the maximum value calculated earlier. The scaled value is then assigned to the corresponding index in the result slice.

Finally, the function returns the result slice, which contains the scaled values of the input list.

In the provided example, the function is called with the input list [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]. The minimum value in this list is 1.0 and the maximum value is 5.0. The function scales each number in the list by subtracting 1.0 from it and dividing the result
