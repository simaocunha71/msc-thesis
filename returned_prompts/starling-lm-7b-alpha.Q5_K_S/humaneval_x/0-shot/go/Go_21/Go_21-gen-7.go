To apply a linear transform to a given list of numbers, we can follow these steps:

1. Find the minimum and maximum values in the list.
2. Calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum values.
3. Subtract the minimum value from each number in the list to shift the range of the numbers.
4. Divide each number in the list by the difference between the maximum and minimum values to scale the numbers.
5. Replace the minimum value with 0 and the maximum value with 1 to normalize the range.

Here's a Python implementation of the RescaleToUnit function that follows these steps:

```python
def RescaleToUnit(numbers):
    # Step 1: Find the minimum and maximum values in the list
    min_val = min(numbers)
    max_val = max(numbers)

    # Step 2: Calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum values
    range_val = max_val - min_val

    # Step 3: Subtract the minimum value from each number in the list
    scaled_numbers = [num - min_val for num in numbers]

    # Step 4: Divide each number in the list by the difference between the maximum and minimum values
    scaled_numbers = [num / range_val for num in scaled_numbers]

    # Step 5: Replace the minimum value with 0 and the maximum value with 1 to normalize the range
    scaled_numbers[0] = 0
    scaled_numbers[-1] = 1

    return scaled_numbers
```

You can use this function to rescale a list of numbers as follows:

```python
numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
rescaled_numbers = RescaleToUnit(numbers)
print(rescaled_numbers)  # Output: [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
```

This implementation ensures that the smallest number in the input list becomes 0 and the largest number becomes 1 after applying the
