func RescaleToUnit(numbers []float64) []float64 {
    minNum := numbers[0]
    maxNum := numbers[0]
    for _, v := range numbers {
        if v < minNum {
            minNum = v
        }
        if v > maxNum {
            maxNum = v
        }
    }
    var res []float64
    for _, v := range numbers {
        res = append(res, (v-minNum)/(maxNum-minNum))

}

In this function, we first get the minimum and maximum values of the array. Then, we iterate over the array and calculate the difference between each value and the minimum. We then divide that difference by the difference between the maximum and minimum values. This gives us the transformed values, which we append to a new slice. Finally, we return the res slice, which contains the transformed values.

Note that this function assumes that the input array is not empty and contains at least two elements.

In the example given, the function RescaleToUnit is called with the array [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]. The minimum value in this array is 1.0 and the maximum value is 5.0. The function then calculates the transformed values for each element in the array, resulting in the array [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0].

This is a useful function for normalizing data or scaling data to a specific range. It can be used in various applications, such as machine learning, data analysis, and visualization.

Here is an example of how to use the function:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    numbers := []float64{1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0}
    rescaledNumbers := RescaleToUnit(numbers)
    fmt.Println(rescaledNumbers) // Output: [0 0.25 0.5 0.75 1]
}
```

In this example,
