To determine if a given string is a palindrome, we can compare the first half of the string with the second half of the string. If they are the same, then the string is a palindrome.

In Go, we can use slicing to get the first and second halves of the string. We start from the beginning and end of the string, and then compare them.

```go
func IsPalindrome(text string) bool {
    for i := 0; i < len(text)/2; i++ {
        if text[i] != text[len(text)-i-1] {
            return false
        }
    }
    return true
}
```

In this function, we use a for loop to iterate over the first half of the string. We compare each character in the first half with the corresponding character in the second half. If any of these comparisons fail (i.e., the characters don't match), we return false, indicating that the string is not a palindrome. If the loop completes without finding any mismatched characters, we return true, indicating that the string is a palindrome.

Note that this function assumes that the input string is not empty. If you want to handle an empty string as a palindrome, you can add an additional check at the beginning of the function:

```go
func IsPalindrome(text string) bool {
    if text == "" {
        return true
    }
    // Rest of the function...
}
```

This will return true for an empty string, and the rest of the function will handle the non-empty string cases.

You can test this function with the provided test cases to verify its correctness:

```go
fmt.Println(IsPalindrome(""))        // true
fmt.Println(IsPalindrome("aba"))     // true
fmt.Println(IsPalindrome("aaaaa"))   // true
fmt.Println(IsPalindrome("zbcd"))    // false
```

The output of these test cases should match the expected results.

```
true
true
true
false
```

This function will correctly determine whether a given string is a palindrome or not.
