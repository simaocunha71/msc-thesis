// If string has 0 or 1 character, it is a palindrome
if len(text) == 0 || len(text) == 1 {
return true
}

// If first and last character of string are equal,
// check if the rest of the string is a palindrome
if text[0] == text[len(text)-1] {
return IsPalindrome(text[1:len(text)-1])
}

// If first and last character are not equal,
// it is not a palindrome
return false
}

In this solution, we check the string from both ends. If the first and last characters are equal, we remove these characters and proceed with the remaining string. If the first and last characters are not equal, we return false because it is not a palindrome. We repeat this process until we reach the middle of the string.

To determine if a string is a palindrome, we compare the first and last characters. If they are equal, we remove them from the string and continue comparing the next pair of characters until we reach the middle of the string. If the first and last characters are not equal, the string is not a palindrome.

Here is a breakdown of the solution:

1. Check if the string has 0 or 1 character. If it does, it is a palindrome. Return true.
2. Compare the first and last character of the string. If they are equal, recursively call the function with the remaining string (excluding the first and last characters).
3. If the first and last characters are not equal, return false because the string is not a palindrome.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until we reach the middle of the string.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n/2), where n is the length of the string. It is an efficient way to determine if a string is a palindrome.

Here are some examples of how the function works:

- IsPalindrome('') returns true because an empty string is considered a palindrome.
- IsPalindrome('aba') returns true because the first and last characters are equal, and the remaining string ('ab') is also a palindrome.
- IsPalindrome('aaaaa') returns true because the first
