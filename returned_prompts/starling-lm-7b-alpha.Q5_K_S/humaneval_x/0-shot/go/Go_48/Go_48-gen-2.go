To check if a string is a palindrome, we can compare the first half of the string with the second half in reverse order. Here's a function that does that:

```go
func IsPalindrome(text string) bool {
    length := len(text)
    if length == 0 || length == 1 {
        return true
    }
    left, right := 0, length-1
    for left < right {
        if text[left] != text[right] {
            return false
        }
        left++
        right--
    }
    return true
}
```

This function first checks if the length of the string is 0 or 1. If it is, then the string is a palindrome, so the function returns true.

If the length of the string is greater than 1, the function initializes two variables, `left` and `right`, to point to the first and last characters of the string, respectively. It then enters a loop that continues until the `left` variable is no longer less than the `right` variable.

Within the loop, the function checks if the characters at the `left` and `right` positions are equal. If they are not, the function immediately returns false, indicating that the string is not a palindrome.

If the characters are equal, the function increments the `left` variable and decrements the `right` variable, effectively moving towards the center of the string. The loop continues until the `left` variable is no longer less than the `right` variable.

If the loop completes without encountering any unequal characters, the function returns true, indicating that the string is a palindrome.

You can use this function to check if a given string is a palindrome. For example:

```go
fmt.Println(IsPalindrome(""))       // true
fmt.Println(IsPalindrome("aba"))    // true
fmt.Println(IsPalindrome("aaaaa"))  // true
fmt.Println(IsPalindrome("zbcd"))   // false
```

These examples demonstrate that the function correctly identifies palindromes and non-palindromes.

Here's a brief overview of the function's logic:
