To determine if a given string is a palindrome, we can compare the first and last characters of the string. If they are the same, we continue comparing the second and second-to-last characters, and so on. If at any point the characters are not the same, the string is not a palindrome.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. We first define the `IsPalindrome` function, which takes a string `text` as an argument and returns a boolean value.
2. We then use a for loop to iterate through the `text` string. The loop runs as long as the length of the `text` string is greater than or equal to 2.
3. Inside the loop, we compare the first character of the `text` string (`text[0]`) with the last character of the `text` string (`text[len(text)-1]`).
4. If the first and last characters are the same, we update the `text` string by removing the first and last characters (`text = text[1 : len(text)-1]`).
5. If the first and last characters are not the same, we return `false` to indicate that the string is not a palindrome.
6. After the loop finishes, we check if the length of the `text` string is 1. If it is, it means that the `text` string is a palindrome of length 1, so we return `true`.
7. If the length of the `text` string is less than 1, it means that the `text` string is an empty string or consists only of whitespace characters, which are also considered palindromes, so we return `true`.
8. If none of the above conditions are met, it means that the `text` string is not a palindrome, so we return `false`.

Overall, this solution checks if the `text` string is a palindrome by comparing its first and last characters and removing them if they are the same. It continues this process until the `text` string becomes empty or consists only of one character, returning `true` if the string is a palindrome and `false` otherwise.

Here are some test cases to illustrate the solution:

```go
