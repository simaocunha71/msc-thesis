To determine if a string is a palindrome, you can reverse the string and check if it is equal to the original string. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code provided:

1. The `IsPalindrome` function takes a single parameter `text`, which is the string to be checked.
2. It initializes a variable `half` to store the length of the string divided by 2. If the length is odd, it will be rounded down using the `int()` function.
3. It initializes a variable `mid` to store the middle index of the string. If the length is even, it will be the `half` index. If the length is odd, it will be the `half + 1` index.
4. It initializes a variable `rev` to store the reversed string. The `:=` operator is used to declare and assign the variable in a single step.
5. It uses a `for` loop to iterate over the first half of the string. The loop starts at index 0 and ends at index `half - 1`. It uses the `<=` operator to include the last index.
6. Inside the loop, it appends the character at index `i` to the `rev` string using the `+=` operator. The `len(text)` function is used to get the length of the string.
7. After the loop, it checks if the length of the string is odd. If it is, it appends the character at index `mid` to the `rev` string. This ensures that the middle character (if any) is included in the reversed string.
8. Finally, it compares the reversed string `rev` with the original string `text` using the `==` operator. If they are equal, the function returns `true`, indicating that the string is a palindrome. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

You can use this function to check if a given string is a palindrome. For example:

- `IsPalindrome('')` returns `true`.
- `IsPalindrome('aba')` returns `true`.
- `IsPalindrome('aaaaa')` returns `true`.
- `IsPalindrome('zbcd')` returns `false`.

Keep in mind that this implementation assumes that the input string
