```go
func IsPalindrome(text string) bool {
    for i := 0; i < len(text)/2; i++ {
        if text[i] != text[len(text)-i-1] {
            return false
        }
    }
    return true
}
```

The above code defines a function `IsPalindrome` that takes a string `text` as an argument and returns a boolean value. The function checks if the given string `text` is a palindrome by comparing each character in the string from both ends towards the center. If any pair of characters do not match, the function returns `false`, indicating that the string is not a palindrome. If all pairs of characters match, the function returns `true`, indicating that the string is a palindrome.

For example, if we call `IsPalindrome("")`, it will return `true` because an empty string is considered a palindrome. If we call `IsPalindrome("aba")`, it will return `true` because the characters at the start and end of the string match. If we call `IsPalindrome("zbcd")`, it will return `false` because the characters at the start and end of the string do not match.

The function uses a `for` loop to iterate through the characters of the string. It starts from the first character and goes up to half of the length of the string. For each iteration, it compares the character at index `i` with the character at index `len(text)-i-1`. If they do not match, it immediately returns `false`. If the loop completes without finding any mismatch, it returns `true`.

Overall, the function provides a simple and efficient way to check if a given string is a palindrome.

In Go, a string is a sequence of Unicode code points. The function handles the comparison of characters in the string correctly, regardless of their Unicode representation.

It's worth noting that the function assumes that the input string does not contain any non-printable Unicode characters or special characters that may not be displayed correctly. If you expect to handle such cases, additional validation or sanitization of the input string may be necessary.

Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input string is `nil`. If you
