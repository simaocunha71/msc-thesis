    var total int = 0
    for i := 1; i <= n; i++ {
        total += i * i - i + 1
    }
    return total
}

To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:

1. Create an integer array a of length n, where each a[i] = i * i - i + 1.
2. Initialize a variable total to keep track of the total number of triples.
3. Iterate through each element in the array a.
4. Check if a[i] + a[j] + a[k] is a multiple of 3, where i < j < k.
5. If the condition is true, increment the total variable by 1.
6. Return the total variable as the result.

In the provided code, the function GetMaxTriples takes an integer n as input and returns an integer value. The function first initializes a variable total to 0. Then, it uses a for loop to iterate through each index i from 1 to n and calculates the value of a[i] using the formula i * i - i + 1. The total variable is incremented by the calculated value for each iteration. Finally, the function returns the total variable as the result.

For example, if n = 5, the function will create an array a with values [1, 3, 7, 13, 21]. The only valid triple that satisfies the condition is (1, 7, 13), so the function will return 1.

Overall, the function GetMaxTriples calculates the total number of valid triples in the array a based on the given conditions and returns the result.

package main

import "fmt"

func GetMaxTriples(n int) int {
    total := 0
    for i := 1; i <= n; i++ {
        total += i * i - i + 1
    }
    return total
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(GetMaxTriples(5))
}
```

In this example, the function GetMaxTriples is called with the argument 5, which represents the length of the array a. The function iterates through each index
