I'm trying to write a function that takes a list and returns a new list which has all the original values of the odd indices. At the even indices, the list should have the values of the original even indices, but sorted in ascending order.

For example, if I call SortEven([]int{1, 2, 3}) it should return []int{1, 2, 3}. If I call SortEven([]int{5, 6, 3, 4}) it should return []int{3, 6, 5, 4}. 

To solve the problem, I've written the following function:

    func SortEven(l []int) []int {
        evenIndices := make([]int, 0, len(l)/2)
        for i := 0; i < len(l); i += 2 {
            evenIndices = append(evenIndices, l[i])
        }
        sort.Slice(evenIndices, func(i, j int) bool {
            return evenIndices[i] < evenIndices[j]
        })
        for i, e := range evenIndices {
            l[i*2+1] = e
        }
        return l
    }

This function first creates a new slice called evenIndices, which contains all the values of the original list at the even indices. It uses a loop to iterate through the original list with a step size of 2, so that it only collects the values at the even indices. 

Then, it sorts the evenIndices slice using the sort.Slice function. This function takes a slice and a comparison function as arguments. The comparison function is used to determine the order of the elements in the slice. In this
