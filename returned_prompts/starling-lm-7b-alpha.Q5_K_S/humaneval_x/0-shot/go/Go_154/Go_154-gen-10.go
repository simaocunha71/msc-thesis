func CycpatternCheck(a, b string) bool {
    l := len(b)
    for i := 0; i < l; i++ {

    return false
}

Explanation:

The function CycpatternCheck checks if the second word or any of its rotations is a substring in the first word. It takes two string parameters a and b. 

To solve this problem, the function uses a simple approach. It iterates over each character of the second word (b) and checks if it is a substring in the first word (a). If it is, the function returns true. If not, it continues to the next character in b. If all characters of b are not found in a, the function returns false.

The function uses the Index method of strings to check if a substring exists in a string. If the Index method returns -1, it means the substring does not exist in the string. If it does not return -1, it means the substring exists in the string.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the second word. This is because the function iterates over each character of the second word once.

Overall, the function CycpatternCheck is an efficient and straightforward solution to check if the second word or any of its rotations is a substring in the first word.

Here's an example of how to use the CycpatternCheck function:

func main() {
    a := "abcd"
    b := "abd"
    fmt.Println(CycpatternCheck(a, b)) // Output: false

    a = "hello"
    b = "ell"
    fmt.Println(CycpatternCheck(a, b)) // Output: true

    a = "whassup"
    b = "psus"
    fmt.Println(CycpatternCheck(a, b)) // Output: false

    a = "abab"
    b = "baa"
    fmt.Println(CycpatternCheck(a, b)) // Output: true

    a = "efef"
    b = "
