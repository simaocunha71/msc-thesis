Explanation:

The function is checking if any of the rotations of the second string is a substring of the first string.

It does this by going through each letter of the second string, starting from the first letter, and checking if the substring of the first string starting from the same position is equal to the second string.

If a match is found, the function returns true. If no match is found, the function returns false.

The function uses the Index() method to find the index of the substring. If the substring is not found, the Index() method returns -1.

In the end, the function returns the result of the check.

The time complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the length of the second string. The space complexity is O(1), as the function does not use any additional data structures.

This solution is efficient because it only needs to check each letter of the second string once, and it does not need to store any additional data.

The solution is also correct because it checks if any of the rotations of the second string is a substring of the first string, and it does so in a way that is efficient and concise.

This solution can be used to solve the problem of checking if a second string is a substring of a first string, even if the second string is rotated.

I hope this helps!

Here are some additional tips for solving this problem:

- Make sure you understand how the Index() method works, and how it can be used to find the index of a substring in a string.
- Be careful to check each letter of the second string exactly once, and to return the correct result based on the check.
- Think about how you can make your code efficient and concise, and consider using built-in methods and functions to help you solve the problem.
- Test your solution with different inputs to make sure it works correctly, and to improve your understanding of the problem and the solution.

I hope this helps you solve the problem
