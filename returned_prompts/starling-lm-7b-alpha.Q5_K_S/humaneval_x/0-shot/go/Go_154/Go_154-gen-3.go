Explanation:

In the problem statement, we need to check if the second string is a substring of the first string or not. But, the second string can also be a substring of the first string in rotated manner. For example, consider the strings "abc" and "bc". Here, "bc" is a rotated substring of "abc". To solve this problem, we can follow the below approach:

1. Check if the length of the second string is greater than the length of the first string. If this is the case, the second string cannot be a substring of the first string. Hence, we can return false in this case.

2. Now, we need to check if the second string is a substring of the first string. For this, we can use slicing to get the substring of the first string starting from the ith index till the end of the second string and compare it with the second string. If these two strings match, we can return true as the second string is a substring of the first string.

3. If the second string is not a substring of the first string, we can check if the second string is a substring of the first string in rotated manner. Here, the rotation is done by taking the second half of the second string and adding it to the first half of the second string. We can again use slicing to get the substring of the first string starting from the ith index till the end of the second string and compare it with the rotated second string. If these two strings match, we can return true
