Explanation:

In this function, we check if the length of the first string is shorter than the length of the second string. If it is, we can immediately return false, as it is not possible for the second string or any of its rotations to be a substring in the first string.

Next, we check if the length of the first and second strings are equal, and if they are not equal. If they are equal, we check if they are equal to each other. If they are not equal, it is not possible for the second string or any of its rotations to be a substring in the first string.

After that, we iterate through the first string from the beginning to the end. If the length of the first string is greater than the length of the second string, we check if the concatenation of the slice of the first string starting from index i and ending at the end of the first string, and the slice of the first string from the beginning to index i (rotated), is equal to the second string. If it is, we return true.

If none of the above conditions are met, we return false, indicating that the second string or any of its rotations is not a substring in the first string.

Overall, this function checks if the second string or any of its rotations is a substring in the first string, and returns true if it is, and false if it is not.
