```go
func CycpatternCheck(a , b string) bool {
    n := len(a)
    m := len(b)
    if n < m {
        return false
    }
    for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
        if a[i] != b[i%m] {
            return false
        }
    }
    return true
}
```

Explanation:
The above approach is not working for the given test case "himenss" and "simen". The function checks if the second word is a substring of the first word. Here, the second word "simen" is not a substring of the first word "himenss". But it returns true because the second word "simen" or any of its rotations can be a substring of the first word "himenss".

For example, if we rotate the second word "simen" to "menis", then it becomes a substring of the first word "himenss". Similarly, if we rotate the second word "simen" to "menis" and "simen" again, then it becomes a substring of the first word "himenss".

Hence, the above approach is incorrect and we need to modify the approach to check if the second word or any of its rotations is a substring in the first word.

Here is the modified approach:

```go
func CycpatternCheck(a , b string) bool {
    n := len(a)
    m := len(b)
    for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
        if a[i] != b[i%m] {
            return false
        }
    }
    return true
}
```
