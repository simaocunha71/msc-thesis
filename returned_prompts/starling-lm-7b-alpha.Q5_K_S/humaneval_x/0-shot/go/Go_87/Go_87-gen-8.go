    var result [][]int
    for i, r := range lst {
        for j, v := range r {
            if v == x {
                result = append(result, []int{i, j})
            }
        }
    }
    sort.Slice(result, func(i, j int) bool {
        return result[i][0] < result[j][0]
    })
    for i := range result {
        sort.Slice(result[i], func(i, j int) bool {
            return result[i][1] > result[j][1]
        })
    }
    return result
}

I have a question about the following code,

the result slice is of type [][]int which is 2D, how come the sort.Slice is used with the func(i, j int) bool parameter, which is a function that takes 2 integer parameters, but is used on a 2D slice, how does this work?

In the documentation for sort.Slice, it states:
"If the length of the slice is zero, Slice returns the slice unchanged."

If the length of the slice is zero, the sort.Slice function will return the slice unchanged, but how does it know that the length of the slice is zero, is this checked before the sort is performed?

To clarify, how does the sort.Slice function work with the 2D slice in this case, and how is it determined that the length of the slice is zero, and how is it determined if the length of the slice is zero, before the sorting is performed?

The sort.Slice function is used to sort a slice, and it's used in this case to sort the result slice, but how does it know to sort the slice, and how does it know to sort the slice in a particular way, based on the func(i, j int) bool parameter provided to it?
