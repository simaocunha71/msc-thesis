Here's a detailed explanation of the solution:

In the Skjkasdkd() function, we initialize the max variable to 0. This variable will store the largest prime value from the given list.

Next, we iterate through the lst slice using a range loop. For each element in the slice, we check if it is prime using the isPrime() function. If the element is prime and greater than the current max value, we update the max variable.

After finding the largest prime value,
