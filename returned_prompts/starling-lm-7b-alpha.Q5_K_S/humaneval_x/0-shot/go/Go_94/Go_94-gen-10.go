To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Iterate through the list of integers and find the largest prime number.
2. Convert the prime number to a string.
3. Iterate through the string and sum up the digits.
4. Return the sum of the digits.

Here's a detailed step-by-step explanation:

1. Find the largest prime number:
To find the largest prime number in a given list of integers, we can use a loop. We start by initializing a variable called largestPrime to 0. Then, we iterate through the list of integers and check if each number is prime. If a number is prime, we update the largestPrime variable with that number. Finally, we return the largestPrime variable, which will be the largest prime number in the list.

2. Convert the prime number to a string:
To convert the prime number to a string, we can use the strconv.Itoa() function from the math package. This function takes an integer as input and returns its string representation. In this case, we pass the largest prime number to the strconv.Itoa() function and store the result in a variable called primeString.

3. Sum up the digits:
To sum up the digits of the prime number, we can use a loop. We initialize a variable called sum to 0. Then, we iterate through each character in the primeString variable. For each character, we convert it back to an integer using the strconv.Atoi() function and add it to the sum variable. Finally, we return the sum variable, which will be the sum of the digits in the prime number.

Here's the complete code for the solution:

```go
import (
    "math"
    "strconv"
)

func Skjkasdkd(lst []int) int {
    largestPrime := 0
    for _, num := range lst {
        if isPrime(num) {
            largestPrime = num
        }
    }

    primeString := strconv.Itoa(largestPrime)

    sum := 0
    for _, char := range primeString {
        sum += strconv.Atoi(string(char))
