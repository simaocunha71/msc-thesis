To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the largest prime number in the list.
2. Convert the largest prime number to a string.
3. Iterate through each digit in the string and sum them.
4. Return the sum of the digits.

Here's the logic behind the code:

1. We use the "math" package to check if a number is prime by using the "IsPrime" function.
2. We use the "strconv" package to convert the largest prime number to a string.
3. We iterate through each digit in the string and sum them using a for loop and the "strconv.Atoi" function.
4. We return the sum of the digits.

Here's an example of how to use the function:

lst := []int{0, 3, 2, 1, 3, 5, 7, 4, 5, 5, 5, 2, 181, 32, 4, 32, 3, 2, 32, 324, 4, 3}
result := Skjkasdkd(lst)
fmt.Println(result) // Output: 10

Note: This function assumes that the list contains only positive integers.

Here's the implementation of the function in Go:

```go
package main

import (
    "math"
    "strconv"
)

func Skjkasdkd(lst []int) int {
    largestPrime := -1
    for _, num := range lst {
        if largestPrime == -1 || math.IsPrime(float64(num)) {
            largestPrime = num
        }
    }

    if largestPrime == -1 {
        return 0
    }

    sum := 0
    for _, char := range strconv.Itoa(largestPrime) {
        if char >= '0' && char <= '9' {
            sum += int(char - '0')
        }
    }

    return sum
}
```

You can use this function to find the sum of the digits in the
