func ChooseNum(x, y int) int {
    if y%2 == 0 {
        if y >= x {
            return y

// Correct Solution:

func ChooseNum(x, y int) int {
    if (y-x)%2 == 0 {
        return x + (y-x)/2
    } else {
        return -1
    }
}

Explanation:

We can solve this problem by finding the middle of the range [x, y] and checking if it is even.
If the middle is even, then we can return it as the biggest even number in the range. Otherwise, we can return -1.

In the provided solution, the middle of the range is calculated as (y-x)/2. If (y-x) is even, then the middle is even, and we can return the middle as the biggest even number in the range. Otherwise, we return -1.

The time complexity of this solution is O(1), as we only need to perform a few arithmetic operations to calculate the result.

This solution correctly solves the problem and has a time complexity of O(1).

// This function takes two positive numbers x and y and returns the
// biggest even integer number that is in the range [x, y] inclusive. If
// there's no such number, then the function should return -1.
// 
// For example:
// ChooseNum(12, 15) = 14
// ChooseNum(13, 12) = -1
func ChooseNum(x, y int) int {
    if y%2 == 0 {
        if y >= x {
            return y
        } else {
            return -1
        }
    } else {
        if x%2 == 0 {
            return x
        } else {
            return -1
        }
    }
}

Explanation:

In the provided solution, we first check if y is even by using the modulo operator (%
