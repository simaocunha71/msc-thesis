In this function, we first check if `x` is an even number, i.e. if `x` is divisible by 2. If `x` is an even number, we also check if `y` is an even number. If `y` is an even number, we return `y`, otherwise we return `y - 1`.
If `x` is not an even number, we check if `y` is an even number. If `y` is an even number, we return `x`, otherwise we return `x - 1`.

The `%` operator in Go is the modulo operator, which returns the remainder of the division of the number on the left by the number on the right. For example, `5 % 2` returns `1`, and `10 % 3` returns `1`.

In this specific problem, we are only interested in even numbers, i.e. numbers that are divisible by 2. Therefore, if a number `x` is divisible by 2, then `x % 2` will be `0`, and if a number is not divisible by 2, then `x % 2` will be `1`.

Here's an example of how the `ChooseNum` function works:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println(ChooseNum(12, 15)) // Output: 14
    fmt.Println(ChooseNum(13, 12)) // Output: -1
}
```

In the example above, the `ChooseNum` function is called twice with different arguments. The first call returns `14`, which is the biggest even number in the range `[12, 15]`, while the second call returns `-1`, because there are no even numbers in the range `[13, 12]`.
