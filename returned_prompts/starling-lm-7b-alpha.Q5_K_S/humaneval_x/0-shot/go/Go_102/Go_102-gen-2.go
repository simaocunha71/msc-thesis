In this function, the parameter x and y are two positive numbers.

We first check if x is even. If x is even, we then check if y is also even. If it is, then we return y. If not, we return y - 1. This is because the range [x, y] is in ascending order, so if y is odd, then the biggest even number in this range is y - 1.

If x is odd, we then check if y is even. If it is, we return x. If not, we return x - 1. This is because the range [x, y] is in ascending order, so if y is odd, then the biggest even number in this range is x - 1.

If none of the above conditions are met, i.e., if neither x nor y is even, then there is no biggest even number in the range [x, y], so we return -1.

The function returns the biggest even integer number in the range [x, y], or -1 if there is no such number.

The test cases are:

ChooseNum(12, 15) = 14
ChooseNum(13, 12) = -1

The first test case checks if the function correctly handles the case where both x and y are even. It returns 14, which is the biggest even number in the range [12, 15].

The second test case checks if the function correctly handles the case where neither x nor y is even. It returns -1, which is the correct output for this case.

These test cases help verify the correctness
