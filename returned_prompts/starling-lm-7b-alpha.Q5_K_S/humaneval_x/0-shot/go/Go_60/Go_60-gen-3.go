To calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n, you can use the following formula:

sum = (n * (n + 1)) / 2

In the SumToN function, the parameter n is an integer representing the upper limit of the range of numbers to be summed. The function returns the sum of the numbers from 1 to n as an integer value.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the SumToN function:

1. Multiply n by (n + 1): This calculates the product of n and n + 1, which is equal to the sum of all numbers from 1 to n.
2. Divide the result by 2: This divides the product by 2, which is necessary to obtain the correct sum of the range.
3. Return the sum: The function returns the calculated sum as the result.

To use the SumToN function, you can call it with a specific value for n and pass it as an argument. The function will then calculate and return the sum of the numbers from 1 to n.

For example, if you call SumToN(30), it will return 465, as the sum of all numbers from 1 to 30 is 465. Similarly, SumToN(100) will return 5050, SumToN(5) will return 15, SumToN(10) will return 55, and SumToN(1) will return 1.

Here's an example of how you can use the SumToN function in your code:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func SumToN(n int) int {
    return (n * (n + 1)) / 2
}

func main() {
    n := 30
    result := SumToN(n)
    fmt.Println(result)
}
```

In this example, the SumToN function is called with the value 30, and the returned sum is printed to the console. You can modify the value of n to calculate the sum for different upper limits.

I hope this helps you understand how to use the SumToN function and calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to n efficiently.
