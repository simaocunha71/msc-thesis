This function, `IsPrime`, takes an integer `n` as an input and returns a boolean value `true` if the number is prime and `false` otherwise.

To determine if a number is prime, the function checks if the number is less than or equal to 1. If so, it immediately returns `false` since prime numbers are defined as integers greater than 1.

Then, the function enters a loop that starts from 2 and iterates until `n-1`. Inside the loop, it checks if the current number `i` is a factor of `n` (i.e., if `n` modulo `i` equals 0). If it is, the function immediately returns `false` since it means `n` is divisible by a number other than 1 and itself, and therefore not a prime number.

If the loop completes without finding any factors of `n`, the function returns `true`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

It's important to note that this function assumes that the input `n` is a positive integer. If the input is not a positive integer, the function may not behave as expected. Additionally, while the function correctly identifies prime numbers, it does not provide any information about the primality of composite numbers.

In terms of computational complexity, this function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the input number. This is because the function checks every number from 2 to n-1 to determine if it is a factor of `n`.

Overall, the provided function `IsPrime` is a straightforward implementation of the prime-checking algorithm that can be used to determine whether a given number is prime or not.

Here are some example uses of the function:

```go
fmt.Println(IsPrime(6))  // false
fmt.Println(IsPrime(101)) // true
fmt.Println(IsPrime(11))  // true
fmt.Println(IsPrime(13441)) // true
