This function checks if a number is prime or not. It first checks if the number is less than or equal to 1, and if so returns false because 1 and any number less than 1 are not prime. It then checks if the number is 2 or 3 and returns true if the number is 2 or 3 because 2 and 3 are prime. It then checks if the number is divisible by 2 or 3 and returns false if the number is divisible by 2 or 3 because a number divisible by 2 or 3 is not prime.

The function then starts a loop at i = 5 and continues until i * i > n. In the loop, it checks if the number is divisible by i or i + 2 and if so, returns false. The loop increments i by 6 in each iteration because all prime numbers greater than 3 are of the form 6k Â± 1, where k is an integer.

If the number passes all the checks in the function, the function returns true, indicating that the number is prime.

This function is efficient and can handle large numbers, but it is not the most efficient way to determine if a number is prime. The most efficient algorithm is AKS primality test, which has a deterministic polynomial time complexity.

This function is a good choice for most programming problems that require determining if a number is prime, especially if the number is relatively small.

Here is an example of how to use this function:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println(IsPrime(6)) // false
    fmt.Println(IsPrime(101)) // true
    fmt.Println(IsPrime(11)) // true
    fmt.Println
