    ret := []string{}

    for _, str := range stringList {
        if strings.Contains(str, substring) {
            ret = append(ret, str)
        }
    }

    return ret
}


In this code, we define a function FilterBySubstring that takes a list of strings and a substring as parameters. The function loops through each string in the list and checks if the substring is contained within the string using the strings.Contains function. If the substring is found in the string, the string is added to a return list. Finally, the function returns the list of strings that contain the substring.

To use this function, you can call it with an input list of strings and the desired substring. For example, FilterBySubstring(["abc", "bacd", "cde", "array"], "a") will return ["abc", "bacd", "array"] since these strings contain the substring "a".

This function can be useful when you need to filter a list of strings based on a specific substring.
