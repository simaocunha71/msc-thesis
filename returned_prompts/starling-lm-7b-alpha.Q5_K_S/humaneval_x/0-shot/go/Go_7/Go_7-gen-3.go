    var result []string
    for _, s := range stringList {
        if strings.Contains(s, substring) {
            result = append(result, s)
        }
    }
    return result
}


In the above code, the FilterBySubstring function is defined to filter an input list of strings only for ones that contain the given substring. Here are some notes about this function:

- The function uses a for loop to iterate over each string in the stringList. The variable s is used to store each string in the iteration.
- Inside the loop, the function uses the strings.Contains function to check if the current string s contains the given substring. If it does, the string s is appended to the result slice.
- Finally, the function returns the result slice, which contains all the strings from the stringList that contain the given substring.

Overall, this function provides a simple and efficient way to filter a list of strings based on the presence of a specific substring.
