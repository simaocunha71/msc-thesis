The error message you are encountering is due to the fact that you are trying to use a variable that is not defined. In Go, variables must be declared before they are used. In your code, you are attempting to use the variable "strings" without declaring it first.

To resolve this issue, you should declare the "strings" variable before using it in the "FilterBySubstring" function. Here's an example of how you can modify your code to define the "strings" variable:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "strings"
)

func main() {
    strings := []string{"abc", "bacd", "cde", "array"}
    result := FilterBySubstring(strings, "a")
    fmt.Println(result)
}
```

In the modified code, the "strings" variable is declared at the beginning of the "main" function. This ensures that the variable is defined and available for use within the function.

By following this approach, you should be able to define the "stringList" parameter in the "FilterBySubstring" function without encountering any errors.

Additionally, it's worth noting that the "FilterBy
