func SumProduct(numbers []int) [2]int {
    var sum, product int
    for _, v := range numbers {
        sum += v
        product *= v
    }
    return [2]int{sum, product}
}

In this solution, we use a for loop to iterate over the numbers slice. For each iteration, we add the current value to the sum variable and multiply it with the product variable. After the loop is finished, we return the sum and product as a tuple.

Here is the code explanation:

- We start by declaring two variables, sum and product, both of type int. These variables will be used to store the sum and product of all the integers in the numbers slice.
- We use a for loop to iterate over each element in the numbers slice. The range keyword allows us to iterate over the slice, and the empty identifier _ is used to ignore the index of each element. This way, we only need to work with the value itself, which we assign to the variable v.
- Inside the loop, we add the current value of v to the sum variable using the addition assignment operator (+=). This operation accumulates the sum of all the integers in the slice.
- We also multiply the current value of v with the product variable using the multiplication assignment operator (*=). This operation accumulates the product of all the integers in the slice.
- After the loop is finished, we return the sum and product as a tuple using the short variable declaration syntax: [2]int{sum, product}. This syntax allows us to create an anonymous array with two integer elements and initialize them with the values of sum and product respectively.
- The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the numbers slice. This is because we need to iterate over each element in the slice once.
- The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of additional memory to store the sum and product variables.

Overall, this solution provides an efficient and concise way to calculate the sum and product of all the integers in a given list, while adhering to the requirements of the problem.
