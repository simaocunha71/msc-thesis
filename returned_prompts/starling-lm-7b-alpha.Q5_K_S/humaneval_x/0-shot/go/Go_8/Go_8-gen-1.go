func SumProduct(numbers []int) (sum, product int) {
    sum = 0
    product = 1
    for _, number := range numbers {
        sum += number
        product *= number
    }
    return
}

You can also use following code:

func SumProduct(numbers []int) (sum, product int) {
    sum, product = 0, 1
    for _, number := range numbers {
        sum += number
        product *= number
    }
    return
}

This code is equivalent to original one but uses short variable declaration to initialize sum and product.
