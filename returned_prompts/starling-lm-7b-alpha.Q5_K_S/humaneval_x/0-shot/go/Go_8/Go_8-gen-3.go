Explanation:

The SumProduct function takes a slice of integers as input and returns a tuple of two integers: the sum of all integers in the slice, and the product of all integers in the slice. The function initializes the sum and product variables to 0 and 1, respectively. It then iterates over each number in the slice and adds it to the sum and multiplies it with the product. Finally, it returns the calculated sum and product.

The provided code demonstrates the usage of the SumProduct function. The first example, SumProduct([]), returns a tuple with the sum and product of an empty slice, which are 0 and 1, respectively. The second example, SumProduct([1, 2, 3, 4]), returns a tuple with the sum and product of the given slice, which are 10 and 24, respectively.

Overall, the SumProduct function provides a concise and efficient way to calculate the sum and product of a given list of integers.

In the provided code, the SumProduct function is defined with two return values, sum and product, instead of a single tuple. This allows the function to directly return the calculated sum and product without the need to explicitly create a tuple. When the function is called, the calculated sum and product values are automatically assigned to the corresponding variables in the calling scope, allowing for easy access and usage of the results.

It's worth noting that the SumProduct function uses a for loop with a range expression to iterate over the numbers slice. This allows for a more concise and readable way to iterate over the slice, as opposed to using a traditional for loop with an index variable. The range expression automatically assigns each element of the slice to the variable number in each iteration, simplifying the iteration logic.

Overall, the provided code demonstrates a clear and concise implementation of the SumProduct function, utilizing modern Go features such as multiple return values and range expressions to improve readability and maintainability.
