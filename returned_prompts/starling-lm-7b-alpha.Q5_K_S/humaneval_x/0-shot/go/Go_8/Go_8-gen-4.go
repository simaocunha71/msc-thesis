```go
var sum, product int

for _, n := range numbers {
    sum += n
    product *= n
}

return [2]int{sum, product}
```

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how this code works:

1. We define two variables, `sum` and `product`, and initialize them both to 0. These variables will keep track of the sum and product of all the integers in the input list, respectively.

2. We use a `for` loop to iterate over each element `n` in the `numbers` list. The `_` underscore is used to indicate that we don't need to use the index variable in the loop.

3. Inside the loop, we increment the `sum` variable by adding the current element `n` to it. This step accumulates the sum of all the integers in the list.

4. We also update the `product` variable by multiplying it with the current element `n`. This step calculates the product of all the integers in the list.

5. After the loop finishes, we return a tuple containing the final values of `sum` and `product`. The tuple is created using the `[2]int` type, which represents an array of two integers.

6. The `SumProduct([])` function call returns the tuple `(0, 1)` since there are no elements in the input list, resulting in an empty sum and a product of 1.

7. The `SumProduct([1, 2, 3, 4])` function call returns the tuple `(10, 24)` since the sum of all the integers in the list is 10 and the product is 24.

Overall, this code provides a concise and efficient solution to calculate the sum and product of a given list of integers.

```go
func SumProduct(numbers []int) [2]int {
    var sum, product int

    for _, n := range numbers {
        sum += n
        product *= n
    }

    return [2]int{sum, product}
}
```

```go
fmt.Println(SumProduct([]int{})) // (0
