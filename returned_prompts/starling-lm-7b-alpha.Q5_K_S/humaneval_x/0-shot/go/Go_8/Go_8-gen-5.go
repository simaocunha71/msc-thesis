```

Explanation:

This code snippet defines a function `SumProduct` that takes a slice of integers (`numbers`) as input and returns a tuple of two integers (`[2]int`). The purpose of this function is to calculate the sum and product of all the integers in the given slice.

Inside the function, two variables `sum` and `product` are declared and initialized with the values 0 and 1 respectively. These variables will be used to store the cumulative sum and product of the numbers in the slice.

A `for` loop is used to iterate over each element in the `numbers` slice. The `range` keyword is used to iterate over the indices of the slice, but the index itself is not used in this case. Instead, the actual value of each element is assigned to the variable `n`.

Inside the loop, the value of `n` is added to the `sum` variable using the `+=` shorthand operator. This updates the cumulative sum of the numbers in the slice.

Next, the value of `n` is multiplied by the current value of the `product` variable using the `*=` shorthand operator. This updates the cumulative product of the numbers in the slice.

After the loop finishes, the function returns a tuple containing the final values of the `sum` and `product` variables.

To test the function, two example calls are made. The first call `SumProduct([])` passes an empty slice to the function, which should return a tuple with a sum of 0 and a product of 1. The second call `SumProduct([1, 2, 3, 4])` passes a slice with four integers, and the function should return a tuple with a sum of 10 and a product of 24.

I hope this helps you understand the code and its purpose! Let me know if you have any more questions.
