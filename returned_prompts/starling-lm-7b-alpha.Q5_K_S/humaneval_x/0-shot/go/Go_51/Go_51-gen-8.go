    // Create a regexp pattern to match all vowels.
    pattern := `[aeiouAEIOU]`

    // Compile the pattern into a regular expression.
    re := regexp.MustCompile(pattern)

    // Replace all matches with an empty string.
    return re.ReplaceAllString(text, "")
}

In this program, a function is implemented to remove all vowels in a string.

In the implementation of the RemoveVowels function, a regular expression is created to match all vowels. Then, the regular expression is used to replace all the matches with an empty string.

The regular expression pattern `[aeiouAEIOU]` matches all vowel characters, both uppercase and lowercase.

The `regexp.MustCompile` function is used to compile the regular expression pattern into a regular expression object.

The `re.ReplaceAllString` function is used to replace all matches with an empty string.

Finally, the modified string is returned.

The program can be tested using the provided test cases.

The time complexity of the program is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because the `ReplaceAllString` function traverses the string once to perform the replacement.

The space complexity of the program is O(1), because the size of the regular expression object does not depend on the size of the input string.

The program can be further optimized if necessary, but the current implementation should be sufficient for most use cases.

In conclusion, the program effectively removes all vowels from a string using a regular expression and provides a simple and efficient solution for this task.
