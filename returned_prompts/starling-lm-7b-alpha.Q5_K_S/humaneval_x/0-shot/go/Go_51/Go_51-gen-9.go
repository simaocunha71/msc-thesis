    const vowels = regexp.MustCompile(`[aeiou]`)
    return vowels.ReplaceAllString(text, "")
}




This is a Go program that defines a function called RemoveVowels. The function takes a string as input and returns a string without any vowels. The program also provides example inputs and outputs to demonstrate how the function works.

To remove the vowels from a string, the function uses a regular expression pattern `[aeiou]`, which matches any vowel. The `regexp.MustCompile` function is used to compile this pattern into a regular expression object. The `ReplaceAllString` method of the regular expression object is then used to replace all occurrences of the vowels in the input string with an empty string, effectively removing them.

For example, if the input string is "abcdef", the function will return "bcdf" because it removes all the vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o') from the string. If the input string is "zbcd", it will return "zbcd" because there are no vowels to remove.

The function also handles cases where the input string is empty or contains only vowels. If the input string is empty, the function returns an empty string. If the input string contains only vowels, such as "aaaaa", the function will remove all the vowels and return an empty string.

Overall, the RemoveVowels function is a simple and effective way to remove all vowels from a string in Go.
