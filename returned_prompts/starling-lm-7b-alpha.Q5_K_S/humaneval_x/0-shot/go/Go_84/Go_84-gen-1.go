ANSWER:
The provided code defines a function Solve that takes a positive integer N as input and returns a string representing the sum of its digits in binary format. The function uses a buffer, sb, of type strings.Builder to build the binary representation of the sum. 

In the main function, the Solve function is called with the value 1000 as an argument, and the result is printed using fmt.Println. The other two commented print statements are left as placeholders for testing the function with different inputs.

The Solve function starts by initializing a buffer, sb, of type strings.Builder. This buffer is used to build the binary representation of the sum of the digits in the input integer N. 

Next, the function enters a loop that continues until N becomes zero. In each iteration of the loop, the remainder of N divided by 2 is calculated using the modulo operator (%). This remainder represents the least significant bit of the binary representation of N. 

The binary representation of the remainder is obtained using the strconv.FormatInt function, which converts the integer value to a string in the base 2 system. The resulting string is then appended to the buffer sb using the WriteString method. 

After appending the binary representation of the remainder, the function updates N by performing an integer division by 2 (N /= 2). This operation discards the least significant bit of N and shifts all other bits one position to the left, effectively dividing the number by 2. 

Once the loop is complete and N becomes zero, the function adds a newline character ('\n') to the buffer using the WriteRune method. This ensures that the output is printed on a new line. 

Finally, the function returns the contents of the buffer sb, which
