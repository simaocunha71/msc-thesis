Explanation
To solve this problem, we can follow the steps below:

Convert the number to a string, then to a slice of integers. For instance, if we have the number 1000, it will be converted to the string "1000". Then, the string will be converted to a slice of integers. Each element of the slice represents the ASCII code of the corresponding character in the string. For example, the ASCII code of '0' is 48.

Next, we initialize an empty byte slice to store the binary result. We also declare an integer variable named sum to store the sum of digits.

Then, we iterate through the slice of integers. For each integer, we add it to the sum of digits. We also append the binary representation of the sum of digits (modulo 2) to the byte slice. After that, we update the sum of digits by dividing it by 2.

Finally, we return the byte slice as a string.

The time complexity of this solution is O(logN), where logN is the number of digits in the input number. The space complexity is O(logN), as we need to store the result as a string.

In the provided main function, we call the Solve function with the number 1000 and print the result, which is "1".
