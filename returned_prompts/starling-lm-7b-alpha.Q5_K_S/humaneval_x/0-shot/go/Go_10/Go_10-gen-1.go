To find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string, we can follow these steps:

1. Reverse the supplied string (strRev).
2. Find the longest common prefix (lcp) between str and strRev, using KMP algorithm.
3. Reverse the lcp and append it to the end of the original string.
4. Reverse the entire string again, and return the result.

The implementation of the KMP algorithm to find the longest common prefix between two strings is provided in the code.

The main function, MakePalindrome, initializes strRev and lcp. Then, it appends the reverse of lcp to the end of str, and reverses the result. Finally, it returns the result.

Here's an example of how to use the MakePalindrome function:

MakePalindrome("cata") // Output: "catac"

The output is "catac" because the longest palindromic suffix of "cata" is "ata", and the reverse of the prefix "c" is "c". Appending them together gives "catac", which is the shortest palindrome that begins with "cata".

Here's a breakdown of the steps:

1. Reverse the supplied string "cata" to get "atac".
2. Find the longest common prefix between "cata" and "atac" using the KMP algorithm. The result is "ata".
3. Reverse "ata" to get "ata".
4. Append "ata" to the end of "cata" to get "catata".
5. Reverse "catata" to get "atacat".
6. The final result is "atacat", which is the shortest palindrome that begins with "cata".

Note: In the code, the KMP algorithm is implemented in the function GetLcp, which finds the longest common prefix between two strings.

The function GetLcp returns the length of the longest common prefix between two strings, and the function GetPrefix returns the actual prefix string.

To find the longest common prefix, GetLcp is called with the supplied string str and its reverse strRev. Then, the index of the longest common prefix is printed using fmt.Println.

Finally, the main function calls MakePal
