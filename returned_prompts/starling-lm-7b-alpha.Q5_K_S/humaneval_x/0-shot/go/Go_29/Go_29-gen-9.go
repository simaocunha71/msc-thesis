To filter an input list of strings only for the ones that start with a given prefix, you can use the following code:

```go
func FilterByPrefix(strings []string, prefix string) []string {
    var result []string
    for _, str := range strings {
        if strings.HasPrefix(str, prefix) {
            result = append(result, str)
        }
    }
    return result
}
```

Explanation:

The `FilterByPrefix` function takes in two parameters: `strings`, which is the input list of strings, and `prefix`, which is the given prefix. It initializes an empty slice called `result` to store the filtered strings.

It then loops through each string in the input list using the `range` keyword. For each string, it checks if the string starts with the given prefix using the `HasPrefix` function from the `strings` package. If it does, the string is appended to the `result` slice using the `append` function.

Finally, the function returns the `result` slice, which contains all the strings from the input list that start with the given prefix.

Example usage:

```go
FilterByPrefix([]string{"abc", "bcd", "cde", "array"}, "a") // Returns: ["abc", "array"]
```

In this example, the `FilterByPrefix` function is called with an input list `["abc", "bcd", "cde", "array"]` and a prefix `"a"`. The function returns a new list `["abc", "array"]`, as these are the only strings in the input list that start with the given prefix.

This solution is efficient because it only iterates through the input list once, and uses the `HasPrefix` function to check if a string starts with a given prefix.

Note: The `FilterByPrefix` function is case-sensitive. If you want a case-insensitive filter, you can convert both the `str` and `prefix` to the same case (upper or lower) before using the `HasPrefix` function.

Overall, this implementation provides a straightforward and efficient way to filter a list of strings based on a given prefix.
