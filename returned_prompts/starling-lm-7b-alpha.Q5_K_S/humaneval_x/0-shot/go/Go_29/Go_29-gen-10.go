The `FilterByPrefix` function takes an input list of strings and a prefix. It returns a new list that only contains strings that start with the given prefix.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The `FilterByPrefix` function is defined with two parameters: `strings`, which is the input list of strings, and `prefix`, which is the given prefix to filter by.

2. Inside the function, a new slice called `filteredStrings` is created to store the strings that start with the prefix.

3. A `for` loop is used to iterate through each element in the `strings` slice.

4. Inside the loop, an `if` statement is used to check if the current string starts with the given prefix. The `strings.HasPrefix(s, prefix)` function is used to check this condition. If the condition is true, the string is appended to the `filteredStrings` slice using the `append` function.

5. After iterating through all the strings, the `filteredStrings` slice is returned as the result.

6. In the main function, a few test cases are provided to demonstrate the usage of the `FilterByPrefix` function. The function is called with different input lists and prefixes, and the expected output is printed using the `fmt.Println` function.

By using the `FilterByPrefix` function, you can easily filter an input list of strings based on a given prefix.

// Filter an input list of strings only for ones that start with a given prefix.
// >>> FilterByPrefix([], 'a')
// []
// >>> FilterByPrefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a')
// ['abc', 'array']
func FilterByPrefix(strings []string,prefix string) []string {
    filteredStrings := []string{}
    for _, s := range strings {
        if strings.HasPrefix(s, prefix) {
            filteredStrings = append(filteredStrings, s)
        }
    }
    return filteredStrings
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(FilterByPrefix([]string{}, "a")) // []
    fmt.Println(FilterByPrefix([]string{"abc", "bcd", "cde", "array"}, "a")) // ['abc
