To filter an input list of strings only for ones that start with a given prefix, you can use the following code:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func FilterByPrefix(strings []string, prefix string) []string {
    var result []string
    for _, s := range strings {
        if strings.HasPrefix(s, prefix) {
            result = append(result, s)
        }
    }
    return result
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(FilterByPrefix([]string{}, "a"))
    fmt.Println(FilterByPrefix([]string{"abc", "bcd", "cde", "array"}, "a"))
}
```

This code defines a function `FilterByPrefix` that takes a slice of strings and a string as input. It initializes an empty slice `result` to store the filtered strings. Then, it iterates over each string in the input slice using a `for` loop and checks if the string starts with the given prefix using the `HasPrefix` function. If the condition is true, the string is appended to the `result` slice. Finally, the `result` slice is returned.

In the `main` function, we test the `FilterByPrefix` function with an empty input slice and the prefix "a" and another slice with strings and the same prefix. The filtered results are printed using `fmt.Println`.

The output of the program will be:

```
[]
[abc array]
```

This means that the function correctly filters the input strings based on the given prefix.

Here are some additional notes about the code:

- The `strings.HasPrefix` function is a built-in Go function that checks if a string starts with a given prefix. It returns `true` if the string starts with the prefix, and `false` otherwise.
- The `for`, `range` construct is used to iterate over the input slice of strings. It assigns each string to the variable `s` in each iteration.
- The `append` function is used to add an element to the end of a slice. It returns a new slice with the appended element.

Overall, this code provides a simple and efficient way to filter a list of strings based on a given prefix.
