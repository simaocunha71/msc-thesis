```
    m := n % p
    if m < 0 {
        m += p
    }
    return m
}
```

This function calculates the result of 2^n modulo p. It does so by taking the modulo of the result of the bitwise modulo operation of the result of n modulo p.

If the result of the modulo operation is less than 0, it adds p to it.

This function is a wrapper around the built-in modulo operation in Go, and is used to ensure that the result of the modulo operation is within the range of the integer.

This function is useful in situations where you need to calculate the result of an exponentiation modulo a prime number, and the result needs to be within a certain range.

For example, if you need to calculate the result of 2^1001 modulo 101, you can use this function to calculate the result.

Here's an example of how you can use this function:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println(Modp(3, 5))  // 3
    fmt.Println(Modp(1101, 101))  // 2
    fmt.Println(Modp(0, 101))  // 1
    fmt.Println(Modp(3, 11))  // 8
    fmt.Println(Modp(100, 101))  // 1
}
```

The output of this program is:

```
3
2
1
8
1
```

As you can see, the function correctly calculates the result of the exponentiation modulo the prime number.

This function is a very useful tool for calculating the result of an exponentiation modulo a prime number, and is especially useful in situations where the result needs to be within a certain range.
