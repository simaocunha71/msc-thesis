To solve this problem, you can use the following steps:

1. Use the modulo operator to find the remainder of `n` divided by `p`. This will ensure that the result is within the range `0` to `p - 1`.

2. If `n` is less than `p`, return `n`. This is because raising `n` to any power will result in `n` itself.

3. If `n` is equal to `p`, return `1`. This is because raising any number to the power of `p` will result in `1` (mod `p`).

4. If `n` is negative, return the same value as `Modp(abs(n), p)`. This is because the result of `n` raised to any power is the same as the result of `abs(n)` raised to the same power.

5. If `n` is greater than `p`, subtract `p` from `n` until `n` is less than `p`. This is because if `n` is greater than `p`, we can repeatedly subtract `p` from `n` until we get a value less than `p`. Then, we can calculate the result as `Modp(n - p * k, p)`, where `k` is the number of times we subtracted `p` from `n`.

6. Use the fast exponentiation algorithm to calculate `pow(n % p, 2)` until the result is less than `p`. This step is necessary to avoid overflow when calculating `pow(n % p, 2^k)` for large values of `n`.

7. Calculate `pow(n % p, 2^k)` using exponentiation by squaring. This step reduces the number of multiplications needed to calculate the result.

8. Return the result of the calculation.

Here is an example implementation of the `Modp` function in Python:

```python
def Modp(n, p):
    if n < p:
        return n
    if n == p:
        return 1
    if n < 0:
        return Modp(abs(n), p)
    while n >= p:
        n -= p
    k = 0
    while pow(
