Modp(n,p)

Explanation:
This function will return the value of 2^n modulo p. It's an implementation of the modular exponentiation (fast exponentiation) algorithm, using binary exponentiation to avoid the need for repeated squaring.

This algorithm first checks if the exponent n is zero. If it is, it returns the base b modulo p. Otherwise, it repeatedly halves the exponent (and multiplies the result by the base each time) until the exponent becomes zero.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm:

1. Check if the exponent n is zero. If it is, return the base b modulo p. This is the base case of the algorithm.
2. If the exponent is not zero, continue to the next step.
3. Set the result to one. This is the initial value of the result.
4. While the exponent is not zero:
   a. Check if the least significant bit of the exponent is set (i.e., if the exponent is odd). If it is, multiply the result by the base modulo p, and decrement the exponent by one. This step effectively halves the exponent and multiplies the result by the base.
   b. If the least significant bit of the exponent is not set (i.e., if the exponent is even), set the exponent to half of its current value. This step effectively halves the exponent without modifying the result.
5. Return the result. This is the final value of the result after all the exponentiation steps are completed.

The algorithm uses modular arithmetic to ensure that the result is always within the range of 0 to p - 1. This is necessary because the result of the exponentiation can be larger than p, and we want to ensure that the result is always within the desired range.

Overall, this algorithm provides an efficient way to compute the modular exponentiation of a number, and it is widely used in various applications, including cryptography and computer science.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(log n), as it only requires a constant number of multiplications and divisions for each bit of the exponent. This makes it much more efficient than the naive approach of repeatedly squaring the base and updating the exponent, especially for large exponents.
