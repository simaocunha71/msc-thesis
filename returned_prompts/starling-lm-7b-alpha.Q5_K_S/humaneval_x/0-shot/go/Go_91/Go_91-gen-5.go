    r := regexp.MustCompile(`.*\.|.*\?|.*\!`)
    nums := r.FindAllStringIndex(S, -1)
    count := 0
    for _, v := range nums {
        if S[v[0]:v[1]] == "I" {
            count++
        }
    }
    return count
}





I'm not sure why it doesn't work, the regular expression should return all indices of '.', '?' and '!' which can be used to find all sentences, then find all sentences that start with 'I', however it doesn't return correct result.

It seems that the regular expression is incorrect, in fact the regular expression is correct, the problem is that the regular expression does not match the whole string, it only matches a part of the string, so the index of the matched part is incorrect, and the index of the whole string is one more than the index of the matched part. Therefore, we need to add one to the index when using FindAllStringIndex.

For example, given the string "abc.abc", the regular expression ".abc" can match "abc", but the index of "abc" is 2, so the index of the whole string is 3, not 2.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "regexp"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println(IsBored("Hello world"))
    fmt.Println(IsBored("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather"))
}

func IsBored(S string) int {
    r := regexp.MustCompile(`(?i).*[!?.]\s*`)
    nums := r.FindAllStringIndex(S, -1)
    count := 0
    for _, v := range nums {
        if S[v[1]+1:v[2]+1] == "I" {
            count++
        }
    }
    return count
}
```

Now it should return correct result.
