    var count int
    var r = regexp.MustCompile(`^I`)
    for _, v := range strings.Split(S, " ") {
        if r.MatchString(v) {
            count++
        }
    }
    return count
}




I'm trying to count the number of "I" that start the sentence in the string. However, the regular expression that I wrote seems to be wrong, and I don't know how to fix it.


I've tried this regular expression: ^I, but I don't understand why it's wrong.


The regular expression you have is almost correct. However, in Go, `regexp.MustCompile` expects a raw string, which means you should prepend the string with a backslash `\`.

Here's the corrected version of your code:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "regexp"
    "strings"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println(IsBored("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather"))
}

func IsBored(S string) int {
    var count int
    var r = regexp.MustCompile(`^I`)
    for _, v := range strings.Split(S, " ") {
        if r.MatchString(v) {
            count++
        }
    }
    return count
}
```

When you run this program, it will print `1`, which is the correct result.

The regular expression `^I` means that it will match any string that starts with the letter 'I'. The `^` symbol is used to denote the start of the string, and the `I` is the actual character you're looking for. However, in Go, you need to prepend the string with a backslash `\` to indicate that it's a raw string.

By making this change, the regular expression will correctly match any sentence that starts with the word "I".

In the `IsBored` function, we use the `strings.Split` function to split the input string into an array of words. Then, we iterate over each word and check if it matches the regular expression using the `
