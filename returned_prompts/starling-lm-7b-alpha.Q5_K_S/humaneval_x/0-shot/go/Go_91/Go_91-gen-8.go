    re := regexp.MustCompile(`I\s.*\?.`)
    return len(re.FindAllString(S, -1))
}




I don't understand why this code won't work.

It returns 1 instead of 2:

The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather. I can't wait to go to school.

It should return 2 because there are two sentences that start with "I".

Here's a simple program that reproduces the error:

package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "regexp"
)

func main() {
    re := regexp.MustCompile(`I\s.*\?.`)
    fmt.Println(len(re.FindAllString("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather. I can't wait to go to school.", -1)))
}

It returns 1 instead of 2.
