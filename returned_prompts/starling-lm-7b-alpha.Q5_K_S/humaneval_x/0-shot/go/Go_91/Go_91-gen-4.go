    r := regexp.MustCompile(`(^I)`)
    return len(r.FindAllStringIndex(S, -1))
}




I don't understand this part:

return len(r.FindAllStringIndex(S, -1))

In this part, what's the role of `-1` in `FindAllStringIndex` function?

The role of `-1` in `FindAllStringIndex` function is to find all the matches in the string, including overlapping matches.

Here's an example:

package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "regexp"
)

func main() {
    r := regexp.MustCompile(`(^I)`)
    S := "The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather. I am bored."
    fmt.Println(len(r.FindAllStringIndex(S, -1)))
}

In this example, the string `S` contains two matches for the pattern `(^I)`: one at the beginning of the string and one in the middle of the string. By passing `-1` to `FindAllStringIndex`, we are telling the function to find all the matches in the string, including overlapping matches. The length of the resulting slice of indices is 2, which is the number of matches found in the string.

Here are some other examples to illustrate the use of `-1` in `FindAllStringIndex`:

package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "regexp"
)

func main() {
    r := regexp.MustCompile(`(^I)`)
    S := "I love this weather. I am bored."
    fmt.Println(len(r.FindAllStringIndex(S, -1)))
}

In this example, the string `S` contains one match for the pattern `(^I)`: at the beginning of the string. By passing `-1` to `FindAllStringIndex`, we are telling the function to find all the matches in the string, including overlapping matches. The length of the resulting slice of indices is 1, which is the number of matches found in the string.
