I'm a beginner in Go, I don't understand what's happening in this code.

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. The function `IsBored` takes a string `S` as input.
2. It initializes a variable `count` to store the number of boredoms found.
3. It creates a regular expression pattern using `regexp.MustCompile`:
   - `^I\s.*\?.*`: This pattern matches a string that starts with the word "I" (ignoring case), followed by any number of whitespace characters `\s`, followed by any number of characters `.*`, and ends with either a period `.`, a question mark `?`, or an exclamation mark `!`.
4. It uses `FindAllStringSubmatch` to find all matches of the pattern in the input string `S`. This function returns a slice of `[][]string`, where each inner slice represents a match and its captured groups.
5. It iterates over the matches using a `for` loop and increments the `count` variable for each match found.
6. Finally, it returns the total count of boredoms found in the input string.

Here are some examples to help you understand how the regular expression pattern works:

- `^I\s.*\?.*`: Matches a string that starts with the word "I" (ignoring case), followed by any number of whitespace characters, followed by any number of characters, and ends with either a period, a question mark, or an exclamation mark.
- `^I\s.*`: Matches a string that starts with the word "I" (ignoring case), followed by any number of whitespace characters, and followed by any number of characters.
- `.*\?.*`: Matches any number of characters, followed by either a period, a question mark, or an exclamation mark, and followed by any number of characters.

I hope this explanation helps you
