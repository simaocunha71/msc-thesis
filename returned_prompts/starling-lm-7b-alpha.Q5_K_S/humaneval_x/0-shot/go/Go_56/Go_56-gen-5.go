CorrectBracketing("><<>") will return false because the opening "<" does not have a closing ">".

To solve this problem, we need to use a stack.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. Initialize an empty stack.
2. Iterate over the characters of the string.
3. If the character is a closing bracket, pop the stack and check if the popped value is equal to the current bracket. If they don't match, return false.
4. If the character is an opening bracket, push it to the stack.
5. After iterating over all the characters, check if the stack is empty. If it's not, it means there are opening brackets without closing brackets, so return false. If the stack is empty, return true.

Here's the code:

```go
func CorrectBracketing(brackets string) bool {
    stack := make([]rune, 0)

    for _, b := range brackets {
        if b == '>' {
            if len(stack) == 0 {
                return false
            }
            top := stack[len(stack)-1]
            stack = stack[:len(stack)-1]
            if top != '<' {
                return false
            }
        } else {
            stack = append(stack, b)
        }
    }

    return len(stack) == 0
}
```

This code uses the `make` function to create a slice of `rune` (which is equivalent to a `string`) called `stack`. Then, it iterates over each character in the `brackets` string. If the character is a closing bracket (`>`), it checks if the stack is empty. If it is, it means there are opening brackets without closing brackets, so it returns `false`. Otherwise, it pops the top element from the stack and checks if it's equal to the current bracket. If they don't match, it returns `false`. If they match, it removes the element from the stack. If the character is an opening bracket (`<`), it pushes it to the stack. After iterating over all the characters,
