Explanation:

In this solution, we'll use a stack to keep track of opening brackets and check whether each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

We initialize an empty slice called `stack` to store the opening brackets that we'll encounter.

We then iterate through each character in the `brackets` string. For each opening bracket (`<`), we add it to the top of the stack using the `append` function. For each closing bracket (`>`), we check if the stack is empty. If it is, then there is no opening bracket that matches the closing bracket, so we return `false`. Otherwise, we remove the last element from the stack using slice indexing.

Finally, we check if the stack is empty. If it is, then all opening brackets have a corresponding closing bracket, and we return `true`. Otherwise, there is at least one opening bracket without a matching closing bracket, so we return `false`.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the `brackets` string, and a space complexity of O(n) as well, since we use a stack to store the opening brackets.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func CorrectBracketing(brackets string) bool {
    stack := []rune{}
    for _, r := range brackets {
        switch r {
        case '<':
            stack = append(stack, r)
        case '>':
            if len(stack) == 0 {
                return false
            }
            stack = stack[:len(stack)-1]
        }
    }
    return len(stack) == 0
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(CorrectBracketing
