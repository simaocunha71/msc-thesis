CorrectBracketing, which is a function that takes a string of "<" and ">", is designed to return true if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. The function starts by initializing a stack using the NewStack() function. The function then iterates over each character in the brackets string. If the character is an opening bracket ("<"), it is added to the top of the stack. If the character is a closing bracket (">"), the function checks if the stack is empty or if the last element in the stack is not an opening bracket. If either of these conditions is true, the function returns false, as there is no corresponding opening bracket for the closing bracket. If the last element in the stack is an opening bracket, it is removed from the stack. After iterating over all the characters in the brackets string, if the stack is empty, the function returns true, indicating that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. Otherwise, the function returns false, indicating that there are unmatched opening brackets.

Here's an example of how the CorrectBracketing function can be used:

CorrectBracketing("<") -> false
CorrectBracketing("<>") -> true
CorrectBracketing("<<><>>") -> true
CorrectBracketing("><<>") -> false

In the first example, there is an opening bracket ("<") but no corresponding closing bracket, so the function returns false. In the second example, there are two opening brackets ("<") and two closing brackets (">"), so the function returns true. In the third example, there are four opening brackets ("<") and four closing brackets (">"), so the function returns true. In the fourth example, there are two opening brackets ("<") and three closing brackets (">"), so the function returns false, as there are unmatched opening brackets.

Overall, the CorrectBracketing function provides a way to determine if every opening bracket in a string has a corresponding closing bracket, and it returns true if this condition is met and false if it is not.
