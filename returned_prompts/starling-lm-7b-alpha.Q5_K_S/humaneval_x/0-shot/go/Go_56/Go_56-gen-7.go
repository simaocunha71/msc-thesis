To solve this problem, we can use a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets we see. When we encounter a closing bracket, we check if the opening bracket that matches the closing bracket is at the top of the stack. If it is not, then the opening and closing brackets do not match, and we return false. If the opening and closing brackets do match, we pop the opening bracket off the stack.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize an empty stack to keep track of the opening brackets.
2. Iterate through each character in the brackets string.
3. If the character is an opening bracket ("<"), push it onto the stack.
4. If the character is a closing bracket (">"), check if the opening bracket that matches the closing bracket is at the top of the stack. If it is not, return false. If it is, pop the opening bracket off the stack.
5. After iterating through all the characters in the string, check if the stack is empty. If it is, all the opening brackets have a corresponding closing bracket, and we return true. Otherwise, there are unmatched opening brackets, and we return false.

Here's a sample implementation of the solution in Go:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func CorrectBracketing(brackets string) bool {
	stack := []rune{}

	for _, char := range brackets {
		if char == '<' {
			stack = append(stack, char)
		} else if char == '>' {
			if len(stack) == 0 {
				return false
			}
			top := stack[len(stack)-1]
			if top != '<' {
				return false
			}
			stack = stack[:len(stack)-1]
		}
	}

	return len(stack) == 0
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(CorrectBracketing("<"))        // false
	fmt.Println(CorrectBracketing("<>
