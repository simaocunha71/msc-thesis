To solve this problem, we can use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. If we encounter a closing bracket without a matching opening bracket, we can return false immediately. If we reach the end of the string and the stack is empty, we can return true. Otherwise, if there are any remaining opening brackets in the stack, we can return false.

Here is a possible implementation of the above algorithm:

```go
func CorrectBracketing(brackets string) bool {
    stack := make([]rune, 0)

    for _, r := range brackets {
        if r == '<' {
            stack = append(stack, r)
        } else if r == '>' {
            if len(stack) == 0 {
                return false
            }
            stack = stack[:len(stack)-1]
        } else {
            return false
        }
    }

    return len(stack) == 0
}
```

This implementation first initializes an empty stack. Then, it iterates through the input string character by character. If a character is an opening bracket, it is added to the stack. If a character is a closing bracket, it is removed from the stack. If a character is neither an opening nor a closing bracket, the function immediately returns false. After processing all the characters in the string, if the stack is empty, the function returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

The time complexity of this implementation is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. The space complexity is also O(n) due to the use of the stack.

```go
func CorrectBracketing(brackets string) bool {
    stack := make([]rune, 0)

    for _, r := range brackets {
        if r == '<' {
            stack = append(stack, r)
        } else if r == '>' {
            if len(stack) == 0 {
                return false
            }
            stack = stack[:len(stack)-1]
        } else {
            return false
        }
    }

    return len(stack) == 0
}
```
