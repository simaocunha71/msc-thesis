This is a bracketing problem, and we can solve it by using a stack.

We start with an empty stack. For each character in the string:

- If the character is a "<" (an opening bracket), we push it onto the stack.
- If the character is a ">" (a closing bracket), we pop the top of the stack. If it is an opening bracket (i.e. it is "<"), then we return false, since there is no matching closing bracket. Otherwise, the top of the stack is an opening bracket and we can safely pop it. If the stack is empty at this point, then we have an unmatched closing bracket, and we return false.
- If we reach the end of the input string without any unmatched brackets, then we return true.

Here's the Go code to implement this:

```go
func CorrectBracketing(brackets string) bool {
    stack := []rune{}
    for _, ch := range brackets {
        if ch == '<' {
            stack = append(stack, ch)
        } else {
            if len(stack) == 0 || stack[len(stack)-1] != '<' {
                return false
            }
            stack = stack[:len(stack)-1]
        }
    }
    return len(stack) == 0
}
```

The function returns true if the input string has correctly bracketed opening and closing brackets, and false otherwise.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. The space complexity is O(n), since the stack can grow up to the size of the input string.

The solution runs in linear time and uses O(n) space, which are both optimal for this problem.

Note: It's important to note that this function only checks if the bracketing is correct. It doesn't check if the brackets are nested correctly (i.e. it doesn't check if each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket).

Here's a test plan for this function:

```go
func TestCorrectBracketing(t *testing.T) {
    assert := require.New(t())
