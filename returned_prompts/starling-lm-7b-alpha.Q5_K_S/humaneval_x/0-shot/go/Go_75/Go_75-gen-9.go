This solution only checks for prime factors up to 29. It's not the most optimal solution,
but it's a good starting point.

The idea is to check if a number is divisible by any of the prime factors up to 29. If it is,
then the number is not the product of three primes, and thus, we return false.
If the number is not divisible by any of the prime factors, then it must be the product of three primes,
and thus, we return true.

We can improve this solution by using a more efficient algorithm to check for prime factors.
One such algorithm is the trial division method, which involves dividing a number by all the prime numbers up to its square root,
and checking if the result is a whole number. If it is, then the number is divisible by that prime number,
and thus, is not the product of three primes.

Here's an example of how we can implement the trial division method in Go:

```go
func IsMultiplyPrime(a int) bool {
    if a < 2 {
        return false
    }
    if a < 4 {
        return
