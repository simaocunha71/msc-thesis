Explanation:

The function IsMultiplyPrime takes an integer a as an input. The function first defines a slice of integers named primes that contains all the prime numbers less than 100.

The function then iterates over each number in the primes slice and checks if a is divisible by each prime number in the slice using the modulus operator (%). If a is divisible by a prime number in the slice, the function returns true because a is the multiplication of at least three prime numbers (the prime number in the slice and the two factors of a). If a is not divisible by any of the prime numbers in the slice, the function returns false because a is not the multiplication of three prime numbers.

The function uses a for loop to iterate over the primes slice. The loop variable i is used as an index to access each element in the slice. The modulus operator is used to check if a is divisible by the current prime number in the slice. If the modulus is equal to zero, it means that a is divisible by the prime number and the function returns true. If the modulus is not zero for all prime numbers in the slice, the function returns false because a is not the multiplication of three prime numbers.

In the example given, IsMultiplyPrime(30) == true because 30 is divisible by 2, 3, and 5, which are all prime numbers. The function correctly identifies that 30 is the multiplication of three prime numbers and returns true.

Overall, the function checks if a
