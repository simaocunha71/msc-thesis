    factors := []int{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97}
    for _, factor := range factors {

This solution is not efficient, since it checks all prime numbers from 0 to 100. It can be optimized to check only prime numbers that are less than or equal to the square root of the given number.

For example, if the given number is 30, the function will return true because 30 is divisible by 2, 3, and 5, which are all prime numbers.

However, if the given number is 42, the function will return false because 42 is divisible by 2 and 3, but not by any prime number in the factors slice.

The function can be further optimized by checking the divisibility of the given number by each prime number in the factors slice in ascending order, starting from the smallest prime number and stopping at the square root of the given number.

Here is an example of how the function can be optimized:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "math"
)

func IsMultiplyPrime(a int) bool {
    factors := []int{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97}
    sqrtA := int(math.Sqrt(float64(a)))
