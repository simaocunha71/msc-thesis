    sort.Ints(l)

    m := make(map[int]bool)
    for _, v := range l {
        m[v] = true
    }
    l2 := make([]int, 0, len(m))
    for k := range m {
        l2 = append(l2, k)
    }
    sort.Ints(l2)
    return l2
}




In the provided solution, the Unique function is designed to return sorted unique elements in a list. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The sort.Ints(l) statement sorts the input list l in ascending order.
2. A map called m is created to store the unique elements as keys. The map is initialized as a boolean map.
3. A loop iterates over the sorted list l and adds each element as a key to the map m. This ensures that only unique elements are stored in the map.
4. A slice called l2 is created to store the unique elements in the order they were inserted. The range expression k := range m loops over the keys of the map m, and each key is appended to l2.
5. The sort.Ints(l2) statement sorts the slice l2 in ascending order.
6. Finally, the sorted unique elements in l2 are returned as the result of the Unique function.

This solution ensures that the returned list is sorted in ascending order while also containing only unique elements.

Here's an example usage of the Unique function:

package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    l := []int{5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123}
    result := Unique(l)
    fmt.Println(result)
}

The output of this code will be:
[0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]

This demonstrates that the Unique function correctly returns the sorted unique elements from the input list.
