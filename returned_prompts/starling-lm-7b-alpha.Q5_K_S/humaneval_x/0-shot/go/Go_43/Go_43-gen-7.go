```go
m := map[int]int{}
for _, v := range l {
    if _, ok := m[v]; ok {
        return true
    }
    m[v*-1] += 1
}
return false
```

This function uses a map to keep track of the frequencies of each element in the input list. It iterates through the list, and for each element, it checks if the negative of that element is already in the map. If it is, it means that there are two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, so the function returns true. If the negative of the element is not in the map, it increments the frequency of that element in the map. If the function reaches the end of the list without finding any two distinct elements that sum to zero, it returns false.

Here are some test cases to demonstrate the function's behavior:

```go
fmt.Println(PairsSumToZero([]int{1, 3, 5, 0})) // false
fmt.Println(PairsSumToZero([]int{1, 3, -2, 1})) // false
fmt.Println(PairsSumToZero([]int{1, 2, 3, 7})) // false
fmt.Println(PairsSumToZero([]int{2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7})) // true
fmt.Println(PairsSumToZero([]int{1})) // false
```

In the first test case, there are no two distinct elements that sum to zero, so the function returns false. In the second test case, there are no two distinct elements that sum to zero, so the function returns false again. In the third test case, there are no two distinct elements that sum to zero, so the function returns false. In the fourth test case, there are two distinct elements, -5 and 5, that sum to zero, so the function returns true. In the fifth test case, there are no two distinct elements that sum to zero, so the function returns false.
