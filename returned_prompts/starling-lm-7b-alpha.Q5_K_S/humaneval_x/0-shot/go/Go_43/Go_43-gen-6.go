The PairsSumToZero function takes in a slice of integers and returns a boolean value. It checks if there are two distinct elements in the slice that sum to zero. If there are, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

The function begins by sorting the input slice in ascending order using the Sort function from the "sort" package. This is done to optimize the search for pairs that sum to zero later on.

After sorting the slice, the function initializes two variables: left and right. These variables keep track of the left and right indices of the current pair being considered.

The function enters a while loop that continues until the left index is less than the right index. Inside the loop, the function calculates the sum of the elements at the left and right indices. If the sum is equal to zero, it means a pair has been found that sums to zero. The function returns true in this case. If the sum is less than zero, the left index is incremented, moving to the next element in the left half of the slice. If the sum is greater than zero, the right index is decremented, moving to the next element in the right half of the slice.

If the while loop completes without finding a pair that sums to zero, the function returns false.

Overall, the PairsSumToZero function efficiently checks for pairs of distinct elements in the input slice that sum to zero by sorting the slice and using a two-pointer approach.

Here are some sample usage examples:

PairsSumToZero([1, 3, 5, 0]) => false
PairsSumToZero([1, 3, -2, 1]) => false
PairsSumToZero([1, 2, 3, 7]) => false
PairsSumToZero([2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7]) => true
PairsSumToZero([1]) => false

In the first example, there are no pairs of distinct elements that sum to zero, so the function returns false. In the second example, there are no pairs of distinct elements that sum to zero, so the function returns false again. In the third example, there are no pairs of distinct elements that sum to zero, so the function returns false. In the fourth example, there are pairs of distinct elements that sum
