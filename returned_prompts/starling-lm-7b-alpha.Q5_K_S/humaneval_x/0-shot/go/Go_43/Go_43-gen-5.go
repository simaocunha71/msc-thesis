// Use a set to keep track of the numbers we've seen so far.

seen := map[int]bool{}

// Loop through the array and check if the current number and its negation
// exist in the set. If they do, we have found a pair of numbers that sum
// to zero. If they don't, add the current number to the set.

return false
}

In the function PairsSumToZero, we initialize a map called seen to keep track of the numbers we have seen in the input list l. We then loop through the input list, and for each number x, we check if it exists in the seen map. If it does, we have found a pair of distinct numbers that sum to zero, so we return true. If it doesn't, we add the number x to the seen map. If we finish looping through the entire list without finding a pair of numbers that sum to zero, we return false.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input list. This is because we need to loop through the list once and check if each number is in the seen map. The space complexity is also O(n), as we need to store all the unique numbers we have seen in the seen map.

This solution is efficient for small to moderately-sized input lists, but it may not be ideal for large input lists, as the space complexity can be high if there are many unique numbers in the list.

Here are some examples of how to use the PairsSumToZero function:

PairsSumToZero([]int{1, 3, 5, 0}) // false
PairsSumToZero([]int{1, 3, -2, 1}) // false
PairsSumToZero([]int{1, 2, 3, 7}) // false
PairsSumToZero([]int{2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7}) // true
PairsSumToZero([]int{1}) // false

In each of these examples, we pass a different list of integers to the PairsSumToZero
