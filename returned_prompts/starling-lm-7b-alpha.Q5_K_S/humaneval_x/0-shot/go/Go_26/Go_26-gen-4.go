To remove duplicates from a slice of integers, you can use the `map` data structure in Go. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:

1. Create a `map` to store each element from the input slice as a key and its corresponding index as a value. You can use a `map[int]int` to achieve this.

2. Iterate over the input slice using a `for` loop. For each element in the slice, check if it exists in the `map`. If it doesn't, add it to the `map` with its index as the value. If it does, skip the element.

3. After iterating through the entire input slice, create a new slice to store the unique elements.

4. Iterate over the `map` using a `for` loop. For each key-value pair in the `map`, append the key (element) to the new slice.

5. Return the new slice containing only the unique elements.

Here's the code implementation of the steps mentioned above:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func RemoveDuplicates(numbers []int) []int {
    m := make(map[int]int)

    for i, n := range numbers {
        m[n] = i
    }

    result := []int{}
    for _, i := range m {
        result = append(result, i)
    }

    return result
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(RemoveDuplicates([]int{1, 2, 3, 2, 4}))
}
```

When you run this program, it will print `[1, 3, 4]`, which is the result of removing duplicates from the input slice `[1, 2, 3, 2, 4]`.

The `RemoveDuplicates` function first creates a map called `m` to store each element from the input slice as a key and its corresponding index as a value. It then iterates over the input slice using a `for` loop and checks if each element exists in the map. If it doesn't, it adds the element to the map with its index as the value. If it does
