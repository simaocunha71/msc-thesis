To solve this problem, we can use a map to keep track of the count of each element in the input list. Then, we can iterate through the input list and add each element to the result list if it does not already exist in the result list. The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list.

Here is the implementation of the RemoveDuplicates function in Go:

```go
func RemoveDuplicates(numbers []int) []int {
    m := make(map[int]bool)
    result := []int{}
    for _, num := range numbers {
        if _, ok := m[num]; !ok {
            m[num] = true
            result = append(result, num)
        }
    }
    return result
}
```

To test the RemoveDuplicates function, we can use the following code:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println(RemoveDuplicates([]int{1, 2, 3, 2, 4}))
}
```

The output of this code is:

```
[1 3 4]
```

As you can see, all duplicate elements have been removed from the input list, and the order of the remaining elements is preserved.

Note: This approach assumes that the order of elements in the input list is not important. If the order is important, a more complex approach is needed, such as using a sliding window or a two-pointer approach, which has a time complexity of O(n).
