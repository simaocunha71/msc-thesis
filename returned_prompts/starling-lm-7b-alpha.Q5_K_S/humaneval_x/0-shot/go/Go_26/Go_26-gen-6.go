func RemoveDuplicates(numbers []int) []int {
    seen := map[int]struct{}{}
    result := []int{}
    for _, n := range numbers {
        if _, ok := seen[n]; !ok {
            seen[n] = struct{}{}
            result = append(result, n)
        }
    }
    return result
}

The above code uses a map to keep track of whether a number has been seen.
For each number in the input, it checks if it's already been seen.
If it hasn't, it adds the number to the result array, and adds a key to the seen map.

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the size of the input array.
Space complexity: O(n), where n is the size of the input array.

If you need to keep the order of elements, you can use a slice instead of a map:

func RemoveDuplicates(numbers []int) []int {
    var result []int
    for _, n := range numbers {
        i := 0
        for i < len(result) && result[i] != n {
            i++
        }
        if i == len(result) {
            result = append(result, n)
        }
    }
    return result
}

In this code, for each number, it searches the result array for the first index where the number is not already present.
If it's not present, it adds the number to the result array.

Time complexity: O(n^2). This algorithm is inefficient, as it requires iterating through the result array for each input number.
Space complexity: O(n), where n is the size of the input array.

A more efficient algorithm is to use a map to keep track of the number of occurrences of each number:

func RemoveDuplicates(numbers []int) []int {
    seen := map[int]int{}
    result := []int{}
    for _, n := range numbers {
        seen[n]++
        if seen[n] == 1 {
            result = append(result, n)
        }
    }
    return result
}

In this code, for each number,
