To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Create an empty map called `numToCount` to store the count of each number.
2. Iterate through the input array and for each element, check if it already exists in the map. If it does, remove it from the array, otherwise add it to the map.
3. After processing all elements, return the resulting array.

Here is the corresponding Go code:

```go
func RemoveDuplicates(numbers []int) []int {
    numToCount := make(map[int]int)
    for _, num := range numbers {
        if numToCount[num] == 0 {
            numToCount[num]++
        } else {
            delete(numToCount, num)
        }
    }
    result := make([]int, 0, len(numToCount))
    for num := range numToCount {
        result = append(result, num)
    }
    return result
}
```

This code first creates a map called `numToCount` to store the count of each number. It then iterates through the input array and for each element, it checks if it already exists in the map. If it does, it removes it from the array and increments the count in the map. If it doesn't exist, it adds it to the map. After processing all elements, it creates a new array called `result` and iterates through the map to add all unique numbers to the result array. Finally, it returns the resulting array.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array. This is because each element in the input array is processed exactly once.

The space complexity is also O(n) because at most n elements from the input array can be added to the result array, and the space required for the map is proportional to the number of unique elements in the input array.

Overall, this solution efficiently removes all duplicate elements from the input array while maintaining the order of the remaining elements.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.
