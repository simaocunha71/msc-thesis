Here's a simple implementation of the function:

```go
func LargestSmallestIntegers(lst []int) [2]interface{}{
    smallest := 0
    largest := 0
    foundSmallest := false
    foundLargest := false

    for _, n := range lst {
        if n < 0 && !foundLargest {
            largest = n
            foundLargest = true
        }
        if n > 0 && !foundSmallest {
            smallest = n
            foundSmallest = true
        }
    }

    return [2]interface{}{
        smallest,
        largest,
    }
}
```

Explanation:

This function works by iterating over the input list of integers. It initializes two variables, `smallest` and `largest`, to 0 and keeps track of whether the smallest and largest integers have been found with the boolean variables `foundSmallest` and `foundLargest`.

During the iteration, if an integer `n` is found to be negative and the largest integer has not been found yet (i.e., `foundLargest` is `false`), it updates the `largest` variable to the value of `n` and sets `foundLargest` to `true`. Similarly, if an integer `n` is found to be positive and the smallest integer has not been found yet (i.e., `foundSmallest` is `false`), it updates the `smallest` variable to the value of `n` and sets `foundSmallest` to `true`.

Finally, the function returns a tuple of the smallest and largest integers as an array of interfaces. If no positive or negative integers are found, the function will return `(nil, nil)`.

This implementation has a time complexity of O(n) because it iterates over the input list once.

Here's a sample usage of the function:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println(LargestSmallestIntegers([]int{2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 7}))
    fmt.Println(LargestSmallestInte
