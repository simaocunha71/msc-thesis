To determine if the list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing, we can compare the current element to the next element in the list. If they are in the same order (either both increasing or both decreasing), then we can continue to the next pair. If not, then the list is not monotonic.

Here's an example implementation of the Monotonic function in Go:

```go
func Monotonic(l []int) bool {
    for i := 0; i < len(l)-1; i++ {
        if l[i] > l[i+1] {
            return false
        }
    }
    return true
}
```

In this implementation, we use a for loop to iterate through the list from the first element to the second-to-last element. Inside the loop, we compare the current element (`l[i]`) to the next element (`l[i+1]`). If the current element is greater than the next element, we immediately return false, as this indicates that the list is not monotonic. If we reach the end of the loop without finding any inconsistencies, we return true, indicating that the list is monotonic.

You can test this function with the provided test cases to verify its correctness:

```go
fmt.Println(Monotonic([]int{1, 2, 4, 20})) // true
fmt.Println(Monotonic([]int{1, 20, 4, 10})) // false
fmt.Println(Monotonic([]int{4, 1, 0, -10})) // true
```

The output of these test cases should match the expected results.

```
true
false
true
```

By using this Monotonic function, you can easily determine if a given list of integers is monotonically increasing or decreasing.
