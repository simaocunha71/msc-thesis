To check if the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing, we can compare each element with the next one. If the next element is less than the current one, it means the list is decreasing. If it is greater, then the list is increasing. Here's how we can do it in Go:

```go
func Monotonic(l []int) bool {
    for i := 0; i < len(l)-1; i++ {
        if l[i] > l[i+1] {
            return false
        }
    }
    return true
}
```

This function iterates over the list and compares each element with the next one. If it finds an element that is greater than the next one, it immediately returns false, indicating that the list is not monotonically increasing. If it iterates through the entire list without finding any such element, it returns true, indicating that the list is monotonically increasing.

To check if the list is monotonically decreasing, we can modify the function slightly:

```go
func Monotonic(l []int) bool {
    for i := 0; i < len(l)-1; i++ {
        if l[i] < l[i+1] {
            return false
        }
    }
    return true
}
```

In this version of the function, we return false if we find any element that is less than the next one. Otherwise, we return true, indicating that the list is monotonically decreasing.

You can use either of these functions to check if a list of integers is monotonically increasing or decreasing in Go.

Hope this helps!

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    l := []int{1, 2, 4, 20}
    fmt.Println(Monotonic(l)) // true

    l = []int{1, 20, 4, 10}
    fmt.Println(Monotonic(l)) // false

    l = []int{4, 1, 0, -10}
    fmt.Println(Monotonic(l)) // true
}
```
