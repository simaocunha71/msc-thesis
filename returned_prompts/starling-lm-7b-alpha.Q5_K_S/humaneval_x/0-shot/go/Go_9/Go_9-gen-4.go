The above code is used to solve a problem:
In a given list of integers, find the maximum element until the given moment in the sequence, and generate a list of such maximum elements.
For example, if the input is [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2], the output is [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4].

To solve this problem, we first create an empty result array to store the maximum element at each moment.
Then, we initialize the maximum value to the first element in the input array.
Next, we traverse the input array from the second element to the last element. If the current element is greater than the maximum value, we update the maximum value and store it in the result array at the corresponding index. Otherwise, we store the maximum value at the previous index.
Finally, we return the result array, which contains the maximum element at each moment in the sequence.

In the example given, the result array is [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]. This means that the maximum element at the first moment is 1, the maximum element at the second moment is 2, the maximum element at the third moment is 3, and so on.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array. This is because we only need to traverse the input array once to solve the problem.

The space complexity of this solution is also O(n), as we need to store the result array of size n.

Overall, this solution provides an efficient way to find the maximum element at each moment in a given list of integers, with a time and space complexity of O(n).

This solution can be easily extended to handle other
