The above code provides a function that generates a list of rolling maximum elements from a given list of integers. 

In the function `RollingMax`, a result slice is created to store the rolling maximums. The variable `currMax` is initialized to the first element in the input slice. Then, a loop iterates over the input slice from the first to the last element. In each iteration, the current element is compared to the current maximum (`currMax`). If the current element is greater than the current maximum, the current maximum is updated to the current element. After the comparison, the current maximum is added to the result slice at the corresponding index. 

The function `max` is a helper function that returns the maximum value between two integers. It compares the two inputs and returns the greater value. 

To use the `RollingMax` function, you can pass a list of integers as an argument and it will return a new slice containing the rolling maximums. For example, `RollingMax([]int{1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2})` will return `[1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]`, which represents the rolling maximums of the input list until each moment in the sequence.

Overall, this code provides an efficient solution to generate a list of rolling maximum elements from a given list of integers.
