    if n > m {
        return -1
    }

    avg := (n + m) / 2
    fmt.Printf("0b%08b\n", avg)
}

In the RoundedAvg function, the average of the integers from n through m (including n and m) is calculated using the formula (n + m)/2. The result is rounded to the nearest integer using the int() function, and then converted to binary using the fmt.Printf() function with the format string "0b%08b\n".

If n is greater than m, the function returns -1 to indicate an error.

Here is an example of how to use the RoundedAvg function:

RoundedAvg(1, 5) // Output: "0b11"
RoundedAvg(7, 5) // Output: -1
RoundedAvg(10, 20) // Output: "0b1111"
RoundedAvg(20, 33) // Output: "0b11010"

Note that the output is in binary format, prefixed with "0b".
