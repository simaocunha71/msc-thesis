func Intersperse(numbers []int, delimeter int) []int {
	var res []int
	for i := 0; i < len(numbers); i++ {
		res = append(res, numbers[i])
		if i != len(numbers)-1 {
			res = append(res, delimeter)
		}
	}
	return res
}

In this solution, we define a function Intersperse that takes two parameters: a slice of integers called `numbers` and an integer called `delimeter`. Inside the function, we create an empty slice called `res` to store the result.

We then use a `for` loop to iterate over the elements of the `numbers` slice. For each element, we append it to the `res` slice using the `append()` function. After appending the element, we check if it is not the last element of the `numbers` slice (i.e., `i != len(numbers)-1`). If it is not the last element, we append the `delimeter` value to the `res` slice as well.

Finally, we return the `res` slice as the result.

This implementation ensures that the `delimeter` value is inserted between every two consecutive elements of the `numbers` slice, resulting in the desired intersperse effect.

To test the function, you can use the provided test cases:

Intersperse([]int{}, 4) should return an empty slice []int{}
Intersperse([]int{1, 2, 3}, 4) should return the slice [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]

You can call the function with the appropriate arguments to verify its correctness.

In this case, the expected output for the first test case is []int{}, and the expected output for the second test case is [1, 4, 2, 4, 3].

By following these steps, you can use the Intersperse function to intersperse a specified delimiter between every two consecutive elements of an input list of integers.
