```go
func Intersperse(numbers []int, delimeter int) []int {
    res := make([]int, len(numbers)*2-1)
    for i := 0; i < len(numbers); i++ {
        res[i*2] = numbers[i]
        res[i*2+1] = delimeter
    }
    return res
}
```

Explanation:

In the `Intersperse` function, we first create a slice called `res` with a length of `len(numbers)*2-1`. This will be our intersperse result. 

Then, we iterate over the `numbers` slice using a for loop. For each element in `numbers`, we assign it to the `res` slice at the `i*2` index, and assign the `delimeter` value to the `res` slice at the `i*2+1` index. 

By doing this for each element in `numbers`, we effectively insert the `delimeter` value between every two consecutive elements in the `res` slice. Finally, we return the `res` slice as the result.

For example, if we call `Intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)`, the resulting `res` slice will be `[1, 4, 2, 4, 3]`, which is the expected output.

Overall, this implementation efficiently intersperse the `numbers` slice with the `delimeter` value by creating a new slice with a length of `len(numbers)*2-1` and assigning the elements accordingly.

Note: The `Intersperse` function can be improved by using the `copy` function instead of a for loop to assign the elements to the `res` slice. Here's an updated implementation using the `copy` function:

```go
func Intersperse(numbers []int, delimeter int) []int {
    res := make([]int, len(numbers)*2-1)
    n := copy(res, numbers)
    for i := n; i < len(res); i += 2 {
        res[i] = delimeter
    }
    return res
}
