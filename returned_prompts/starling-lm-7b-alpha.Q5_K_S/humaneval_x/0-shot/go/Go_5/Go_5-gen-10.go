In this problem we need to insert a `delimeter` between every two consecutive elements of the input list `numbers`.

Here is a step-by-step solution:

1. Create an empty result list `result` and a loop variable `i`.
2. Enter a for loop that iterates through the `numbers` list. For each iteration, append the current element (`numbers[i]`) to the `result` list, followed by the `delimeter`.
3. After the loop, return the `result` list.

Here's the Go code that follows the above steps:

```go
func Intersperse(numbers []int, delimeter int) []int {
    result := []int{}
    i := 0

    for ; i < len(numbers); i++ {
        result = append(result, numbers[i])
        result = append(result, delimeter)
    }

    return result
}
```

The time complexity of the above function is O(n), where n is the length of the `numbers` list. This is because the function iterates through the `numbers` list once.

The space complexity is also O(n), since the function creates a new list that has the same length as the `numbers` list.

```go
package main

func main() {
    fmt.Println(Intersperse([]int{1, 2, 3}, 4))
}
```

The above `main` function will output `[1, 4, 2, 4, 3]`.

That's it! We've successfully interspersed a `delimeter` between every two consecutive elements of the input list `numbers`.

Hope this helps!
