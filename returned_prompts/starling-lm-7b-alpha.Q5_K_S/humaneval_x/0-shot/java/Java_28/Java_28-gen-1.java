    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    for (String s : strings) {
        sb.append(s);
    }
    return sb.toString();

}
}

In this program, we define a class named Solution. Inside this class, there is a method named concatenate that takes a List of Strings as an argument and returns a String. The method creates a StringBuilder object named sb. Then, using a for-each loop, it iterates over all the strings in the input list. For each string, it appends the string to the StringBuilder object. Finally, it returns the concatenated string by invoking the toString() method of the StringBuilder object.

The time complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the number of strings in the input list. This is because each string in the input list is appended to the StringBuilder object exactly once.

The space complexity of this program is O(1), because it only uses a fixed amount of extra space to store the result.

To test the program, we use the >>> notation to define a list of strings and invoke the concatenate method on this list. We then print the result using the print() function.

For example, if we invoke concatenate with an empty list, the program will print an empty string. If we invoke concatenate with a list containing the strings "a", "b", and "c", the program will print "abc".

Overall, this program efficiently concatenates a list of strings into a single string, providing a useful tool for string manipulation in Java.
