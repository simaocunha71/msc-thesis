Ans:
To find the largest prime value from the given list of integers and return the sum of its digits, you can follow these steps:

1. Iterate through the list of integers and find the largest prime number using the isPrime() function. The isPrime() function checks if a number is prime by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number and checking if it is divisible by any number in that range. If it is divisible, the number is not prime.

2. Once you find the largest prime number, you can calculate the sum of its digits by continuously dividing the number by 10 and adding the remainder (digit) to the sum variable until the number becomes 0.

3. Finally, return the sum of the digits of the largest prime number.

In the provided code, the skjkasdkd() function implements the above steps to find the largest prime number from the given list and returns the sum of its digits.

You can use the skjkasdkd() function to find the largest prime number and its digit sum from the given list of integers.

Here's an example usage of the skjkasdkd() function:

List<Integer> lst = Arrays.asList(0, 3, 2, 1, 3, 5, 7, 4, 5, 5,
