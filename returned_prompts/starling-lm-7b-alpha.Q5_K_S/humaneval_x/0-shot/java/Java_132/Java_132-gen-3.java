The time complexity of this solution is O(n) since we only iterate over the input string once, and the space complexity is O(n) since we use a stack to store the opening brackets.

Explanation:
The idea behind this solution is to use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets encountered in the input string. Whenever we encounter an opening bracket, we push it onto the stack. Whenever we encounter a closing bracket, we pop the top element from the stack and check if it matches the closing bracket. If it doesn't match, it means there is no valid subsequence of brackets, so we return false. If the stack becomes empty at the end, it means all opening brackets have been matched with closing brackets, and there is at least one bracket nested, so we return true. Otherwise, if the stack is not empty at the end, it means there is no valid subsequence of brackets, so we return false.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) since we only iterate over the input string once, and the space complexity is O(n) since we use a stack to store the opening brackets.

Note: This solution assumes that the input string contains only square brackets and no other characters.
