```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Solution {
    public List<String> allPrefixes(String string) {
        List<String> prefixes = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 1; i <= string.length(); i++) {
            prefixes.add(string.substring(0, i));
        }
        return prefixes;
    }
}
```

Explanation:
This solution works by initializing an empty ArrayList of strings called prefixes. Then, it uses a for loop to iterate from 1 to the length of the input string. In each iteration, it adds the substring starting at index 0 and ending at the current iteration's index to the prefixes ArrayList. The substring method is used to achieve this. Finally, it returns the prefixes ArrayList containing all the prefixes from shortest to longest of the input string.

Complexity Analysis:
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because the for loop iterates n times to generate all the prefixes.
- Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because the ArrayList of prefixes has a capacity of n.

            prefixes.add(string.substring(0, i));
        }
        return prefixes;
    }
