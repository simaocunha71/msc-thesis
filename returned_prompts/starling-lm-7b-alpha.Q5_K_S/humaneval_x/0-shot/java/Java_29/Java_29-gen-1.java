    List<String> result = strings.stream()
        .filter(s -> s.startsWith(prefix))
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
    return result;
    }
}



Answer & Explanation:

In this problem, we are required to filter a given list of strings that only contain the given prefix.
To solve this problem, we can use the stream API in Java to filter the list of strings. The stream API allows us to transform and filter the list of strings using functional programming methods.

In the provided solution, the `filterByPrefix` method takes in two parameters: the `strings` list and the `prefix` string. It returns a new list of strings that contain the given prefix.

Inside the method, we use the `stream` method on the `strings` list to convert it into a stream of strings. Then, we use the `filter` method on the stream to filter out the strings that do not start with the given prefix. The `startsWith` method is used to check if a string starts with the given prefix.

Finally, we use the `collect` method on the filtered stream to collect the strings into a new list. The `toList` collector is used to convert the stream back into a list of strings.

The resulting list is then returned as the output of the `filterByPrefix` method.

To test the solution, we provide two examples using the `>>>` syntax. The first example demonstrates the case where the input list is empty and the given prefix is "a". The expected output is an empty list. The second example demonstrates the case where the input list is `["abc", "bcd", "cde", "array"]` and the given prefix is "a". The expected output is `["abc", "array"]`.

Overall, this solution uses the stream API and functional programming methods to filter a list of strings based on a given prefix.
