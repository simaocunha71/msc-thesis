Here's a solution to truncate the decimal part of a positive floating point number.

The `truncateNumber` method takes a `double` number as input and returns a `double` value representing the decimal part of the number.

Here's how it works:

1. It checks if the number is equal to 0.0. If yes, it immediately returns 0.0, as there are no decimals to truncate.

2. If the number is not equal to 0.0, it proceeds to the next step.

3. It subtracts the integer part of the number from the number itself using the `Math.floor` function. This gives us the decimal part of the number.

4. Finally, it returns the decimal part, effectively truncating the original number to just the decimals.

For example, if you call `truncateNumber(3.5)`, it will return `0.5`, as it is the decimal part of the number 3.5.

This solution ensures that the decimal part of the number is correctly truncated, while keeping the integer part intact.

Note: This solution assumes that the input number is a positive floating point number. It does not handle negative numbers or non-numeric input.

Here's the code for the `truncateNumber` method:

```java
public double truncateNumber(double number) {
    if(number == 0.0)
        return 0.0;

    return number - Math.floor(number);
}
```

You can use this method to truncate the decimal part of any positive floating point number in your Java program.
