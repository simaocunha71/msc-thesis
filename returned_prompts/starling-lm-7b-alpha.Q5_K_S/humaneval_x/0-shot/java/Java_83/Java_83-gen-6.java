ANSWER:
The code snippet provided is a Java implementation of a class named Solution. The class contains a method named startsOneEnds, which takes a positive integer n as a parameter and returns the count of the numbers of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1.

The method first checks if n is equal to 1. If it is, it returns 2, as there are two such numbers: 1 and 10.

If n is greater than 1, the method proceeds to calculate the count of such numbers. It assigns the value of (10^(n-1)) * 2 to the variable res, which represents the count of numbers that start with 1. Then, it subtracts (10^(n-2)) from res to remove the count of numbers that start with 1 but are not 10 itself. Finally, it adds (10^(n-2)) to res to include the count of numbers that start with 1 but are not 10.

The method returns the calculated count of numbers that start or end with 1.

To use this code, you can create an instance of the Solution class and call the startsOneEnds method with the desired value of n as an argument. The method will return the count of numbers that start or end with 1 for that value of n.
