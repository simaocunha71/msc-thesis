        // First, we need to determine if the given array is palindromic.
        // A palindromic array is an array that reads the same forwards and backwards.
        // For example, if the given array is [1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 9, 6],
        // it is not palindromic since 9 is not equal to 7.

        // To determine if the array is palindromic, we can use a two-pointer approach.
        // We start from the beginning and the end of the array, and move the pointers towards the center.
        // If the elements at the two pointers are not equal, then the array is not palindromic.
        // For example, if the array is [1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 9, 6],
        // the pointers will stop at (3, 5) since 5 is not equal to 9.

        // Once we find that the array is not palindromic, we can start counting the number of elements
        // that need to be changed to make the array palindromic.
        // We can use a hash map to keep track of the elements that need to be changed.
        // For each element in the array, if it is not the same as its mirror image (the element at the same position from the end of the array),
        // we add it to the hash map.
        // For example, if the array is [1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 9, 6],
        // the hash map will contain {2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 9} since these elements need to be changed to make the array palindromic.

        // Finally, we can return the size of the hash map, which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be changed.
        // For example, if the array is [1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 9, 6],
        // the size of the hash map is 5, so the minimum number of elements that need to be changed is 5.

        // Here is a step-by-
