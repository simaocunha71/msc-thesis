        double area = (a * h) / 2;
        return area;
    }
}

To calculate the area of a triangle, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle, which is the base times the height divided by 2. In this case, the base is a and the height is h.

Here is an example of how you can use the `triangleArea` function in Java:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.triangleArea(5, 3));
    }
}
```

This will output `7.5`, which is the area of the triangle with base 5 and height 3.

Note that the function `triangleArea` takes in two `double` values as parameters and returns a `double` value. It calculates the area of a triangle using the formula mentioned above and returns the result.

In the example above, we create a new instance of the `Solution` class and call the `triangleArea` function with the values `5` and `3`. The result, `7.5`, is then printed to the console.

You can use this function in your own code to calculate the area of a triangle based on the length of its base and the height of the triangle.
