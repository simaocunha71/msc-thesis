The `greatestCommonDivisor` method calculates the greatest common divisor of two integers `a` and `b` using Euclid's algorithm. This algorithm repeatedly divides the larger number by the smaller number and replaces the larger number with the remainder until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the greatest common divisor.

The method starts with a while loop that continues as long as `b` is not equal to zero. Inside the loop, the remainder of `a` divided by `b` is calculated and stored in the variable `tmp`. Then, the value of `a` is updated to be equal to `b`, and the value of `b` is updated to be equal to `tmp`. This process is repeated until `b` becomes zero. Finally, the value of `a` is returned as the greatest common divisor of the original `a` and `b`.

For example, when `greatestCommonDivisor(3, 5)` is called, the algorithm starts with `a` equal to 3 and `b` equal to 5. In each iteration of the loop, the remainder of 3 divided by 5 is calculated to be 3. The values of `a` and `b` are then updated to be equal to 5 and 3, respectively. In the next iteration, the remainder of 5 divided by 3 is calculated to be 2. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to be equal to 3 and 2, respectively. Finally, in the last iteration, the remainder of 3 divided by 2 is calculated to be 1. The value of `a` is updated to be equal to 2, but `b` is zero, so the loop ends. The value of `a` is returned as the greatest common divisor, which is 1 in this case.

Similarly, when `greatestCommonDivisor(25, 15)` is called, the algorithm starts with `a` equal to 25 and `b` equal to 15. In each iteration of the loop,
