In this problem, we have two arrays, `game` and `guess`, of the same length. The `game` array contains the scores of some matches, and the `guess` array contains the corresponding guesses made by a person. The goal is to determine and return an array that contains the absolute differences between the correct scores and the guessed scores at each index. If the guess is correct, the value in the result array should be 0; otherwise, it should be the absolute difference between the guess and the actual score.

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Create an empty list called `result` to store the absolute differences between the guesses and the scores.
2. Iterate through each index of the `game` and `guess` arrays using a `for` loop. The loop should run until the index reaches the length of the `game` array.
3. Inside the loop, calculate the absolute difference between the score at the current index of the `game` array and the guess at the same index of the `guess` array using the `Math.abs()` function. This value represents the difference between the actual score and the guessed score.
4. Add the calculated absolute difference to the `result` list using the `result.add()` method.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for all indices in the `game` and `guess` arrays.
6. After the loop finishes, return the `result` list, which contains the absolute differences between the guesses and the
