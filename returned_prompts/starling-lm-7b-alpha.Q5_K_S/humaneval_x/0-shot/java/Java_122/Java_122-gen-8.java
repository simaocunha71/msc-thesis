ANSWER:
Here is a solution that passes all tests.

The `addElements` function takes in two parameters: an array of integers called `arr` and an integer called `k`. The function aims to return the sum of all the elements in `arr` that have at most two digits from the first `k` elements.

To solve this problem, the function initializes a variable `sum` to 0. Then, it iterates over the first `k` elements of `arr` using a for loop. For each element, it checks the length of the element by converting it to a string using `String.valueOf(num).length()`. If the length is less than or equal to 2, it adds the element to the `sum` and continues to the next element using the `continue A` statement, which means to skip the rest of the loop and move to the next iteration.

Finally, the function returns the `sum` after all the elements with at most two digits have been added.

This solution meets all the requirements specified in the question, including the example and the constraints.
