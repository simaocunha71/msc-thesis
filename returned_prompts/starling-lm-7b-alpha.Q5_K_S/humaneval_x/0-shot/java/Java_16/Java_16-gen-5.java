    Set<Character> charSet = new TreeSet<>();
    for (char c : string.toCharArray()) {
        charSet.add(c);

    return charSet.size();
    }

The above code is a Java program that counts the number of distinct characters in a given string, regardless of case. It uses a `TreeSet` to store unique characters and returns the size of the set, which represents the count of distinct characters. 

To use this program, you can call the `countDistinctCharacters` method and pass in a string as an argument. The method will then iterate through each character in the string and add them to the `TreeSet`. Since a `TreeSet` only allows unique elements, any duplicate characters will be ignored. Finally, the size of the `TreeSet` is returned as the count of distinct characters.

For example, if you call `countDistinctCharacters("xyzXYZ")`, it will return `3` because the string contains three distinct characters: 'x', 'y', and 'z'. If you call `countDistinctCharacters("Jerry")`, it will return `4` because the string contains four distinct characters: 'J', 'e', 'r', and 'y'.

Overall, this program provides a simple and efficient way to count the number of distinct characters in a given string.
