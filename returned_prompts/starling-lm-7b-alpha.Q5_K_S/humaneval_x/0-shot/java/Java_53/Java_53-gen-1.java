    while(y != 0) {
        int carry = x & y;
        x = x ^ y;
        y = carry << 1;
    }
    return x;
    }
}


Answer:While loop is used to add the two numbers x and y.A carry is generated from the bits of x and y.The carry is added to the bits of x and y.The result is returned.

Explanation:

The add() function uses a while loop to add the two numbers x and y. It starts by initializing a carry variable to 0. The while loop runs until the carry is 0. Inside the loop, the carry is calculated by performing a bitwise AND operation on x and y. The x variable is then updated by performing a bitwise XOR operation on x and y. The y variable is updated by shifting the carry one position to the left. This process continues until the carry becomes 0. Finally, the function returns the result, which is the sum of x and y.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of bits in the larger of the two input numbers. The space complexity is O(1), as the solution uses a constant amount of extra space.

Overall, this solution provides an efficient way to add two numbers using bitwise operations and a while loop, with a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1).
