        while (y != 0) {
            int carry = x & y;
            x ^= y;
            y = carry << 1;
        }
        return x;
    }
}



Answer:
While loop is used to calculate the sum of two numbers x and y. In each iteration, carry is calculated by performing bitwise AND operation on both variables x and y. Then x is updated by performing bitwise XOR operation between x and y and y is updated by performing left shift operation on carry. This process continues until the value of y becomes 0.

Explanation:
The code uses a while loop to calculate the sum of two numbers x and y. Inside the loop, a carry is calculated by performing the bitwise AND operation between x and y. Then, x is updated by performing the bitwise XOR operation between x and y, and y is updated by performing a left shift operation on the carry. This process continues until the value of y becomes 0. The final value of x is the sum of the two input numbers.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of bits in the input numbers. The space complexity is O(1), as no extra space is used. 

This solution is an implementation of the bitwise XOR and bitwise AND operators in Java. 

This solution provides a more efficient way of adding two numbers as it avoids the use of the addition operator. 

This solution can be used in situations where the addition operator is not available or is too slow. 

This solution is suitable for situations where the input numbers are large and require a lot of memory to store, as it only uses a small amount of extra memory. 

This solution is suitable for situations where the input numbers are large and require a lot of time to add using the addition operator, as it is faster.
