This program is written in Java.

This program defines a class called `Solution`. In this class, there is a method named `meanAbsoluteDeviation` that takes a list of doubles as an argument and returns a double as the result.

The method first calculates the mean of the input numbers by summing all the numbers and dividing the sum by the size of the list. Then, for each number in the list, it adds the absolute value of the difference between the number and the mean to a variable called `sum`. After the loop, it returns the average of the absolute differences by dividing the `sum` by the size of the list.

To use this program, you can create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `meanAbsoluteDeviation` method with a list of doubles as an argument. For example, `meanAbsoluteDeviation(Arrays.asList(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0))` will return the mean absolute deviation of the given list of numbers, which is 1.0.
