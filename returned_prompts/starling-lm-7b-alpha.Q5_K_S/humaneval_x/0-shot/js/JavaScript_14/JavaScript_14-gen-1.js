To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Create an empty array to store the prefixes, called `prefixes`.
2. Iterate through the `string` using a `for` loop, starting from 0 and going up to the length of the `string`.
3. Inside the loop, use the `substring` method to get the prefix of the `string` from index 0 to the current iteration index, and push it to the `prefixes` array.
4. After the loop, return the `prefixes` array.

Here's the code for the solution:

```javascript
const allPrefixes = (string) => {
  const prefixes = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < string.length; i++) {
    prefixes.push(string.substring(0, i + 1));
  }

  return prefixes;
};
```

This solution will return an array of all the prefixes of the input string, sorted from short
