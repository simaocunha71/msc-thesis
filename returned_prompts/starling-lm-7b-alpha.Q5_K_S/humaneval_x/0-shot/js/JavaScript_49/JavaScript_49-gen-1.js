To solve this problem, you can use the following steps:

1. Initialize a variable `r` to 1, which will store the result of the calculation.
2. Use a while loop to continuously multiply `r` by `n` as long as `n` is less than `p`.
3. Inside the loop, calculate the modulo of `r` and `n` using the modulo operator `%`. This will ensure that the result stays within the range of `p`.
4. If `n` is equal to 0, set `r` to 1, as any number raised to the power of 0 is 1.
5. Once the loop finishes, return the value of `r`.

Here's the code that implements the above steps:
```javascript
const modp = (n, p) => {
  let r = 1;
  while (n < p) {
    r = (r * n) % p;
    n++;
  }
  if (n === 0) {
    r = 1;
  }
  return r;
};
```
You can test the function with the provided test cases to verify its correctness.

/*
  >>> modp(3, 5)
  3
  >>> modp(1101, 101)
  2
  >>> modp(0, 101)
  1
  >>> modp(3, 11)
  8
  >>> modp(100, 101)
  1
*/

*/

// Solution

const modp = (n, p) => {
  let r = 1;
  while (n < p) {
    r = (r * n) % p;
    n++;
  }
  if (n === 0) {
    r = 1;
  }
  return r;
};

console.log(modp(3, 5)); // 3
console.log(modp(1101, 101)); // 2
console.log(modp(0, 101)); // 1
console.log(modp(3, 11)); // 8
