To calculate 2^n modulo p, you can use the fast exponentiation algorithm, also known as the "exponentiation by squaring" algorithm. Here's how you can implement it:

1. Initialize a variable `result` to 1, which will hold the final result.
2. While `n` is greater than 0:
    a. If `n` is odd, multiply `result` by 2 and take the modulo with `p`. Then, subtract 1 from `n`.
    b. If `n` is even, divide `n` by 2, and square `result` (multiply `result` by itself).
3. Return the final value of `result`.

Here's the Python code for the `modp` function:

```python
def modp(n, p):
    result = 1
    while n > 0:
        if n % 2 == 1:
            result = (result * 2) % p
            n -= 1
        else:
            n //= 2
            result = (result * result) % p
    return result
```

And here's how you can test the function with the provided test cases:

```python
print(modp(3, 5))  # Output: 3
print(modp(1101, 101))  # Output: 2
print(modp(0, 101))  # Output: 1
print(modp(3, 11))  # Output: 8
print(modp(100, 101))  # Output: 1
```

The `modp` function takes two arguments: `n` (the exponent) and `p` (the modulus). It uses the fast exponentiation algorithm to calculate 2^n modulo p and returns the result. The algorithm uses a while loop to repeatedly update the result based on the parity of `n`. If `n` is odd, it multiplies the result by 2 and takes the modulo with `p`, and if `n` is even, it squares the result (multiplies it by itself). The loop continues until `n` becomes 0.
