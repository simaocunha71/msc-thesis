/*

The above code returns the value of y if n is a prime number, otherwise it returns the value of x.

To determine whether a number is prime, the code checks if the number is greater than 2 and if it is not divisible by 2. If both conditions are true, the function returns the value of y. Otherwise, it returns the value of x.

For example, when the function is called with the arguments (7, 34, 12), it returns 34 because 7 is a prime number. When it is called with the arguments (15, 8, 5), it returns 5 because 15 is not a prime number.

The console.log statements at the end of the code demonstrate the usage of the function with the provided examples.

*/

/*

To use this code, you can simply copy and paste it into your JavaScript environment or editor. Then, you can call the function with the appropriate arguments to get the desired result.

For example, to calculate the value of xOrY(7, 34, 12), you can use the following code:

console.log(xOrY(7, 34, 12)); // 34

This will output the result 34 to the console. Similarly, you can call the function with different arguments to get different results.

The function xOrY takes three arguments: n, x, and y. It returns the value of y if n is a prime number, otherwise it returns the value of x.

To determine whether a number is prime, the function checks if the number is greater than 2 and if it is not divisible by 2. If both conditions are true, the function returns the value of y. Otherwise, it returns the value of x.
