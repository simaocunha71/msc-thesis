In the code, we initialize `largestIndex` to -1, which will be the result if no such element exists. Then, we iterate through the array using a for loop.

Inside the loop, we check if the current element is greater than the element at the `largestIndex`. If it is, we update the `largestIndex` to the current index. If `largestIndex` is still -1 or the current element is greater than the element at `largestIndex`, we update `largestIndex` to the current index.

Finally, we return the value of `largestIndex`, which will be the index of the largest element that is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it, or -1 if no such element exists.

We test the function with two example arrays and print the results using `console.log()`.

The output of the first test is 3, as the largest element that is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it is at index 3.

The output of the second test is -1, as there is no such element in the array.

Overall, this function finds the index of the largest element that meets the given conditions and returns either the index or -1 if no such element exists.
