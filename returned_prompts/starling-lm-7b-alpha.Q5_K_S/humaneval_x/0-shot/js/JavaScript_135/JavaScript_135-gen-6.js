/*
  The function canArrange takes an array of elements and iterates through it using two nested for loops. The outer loop iterates through each element in the array, while the inner loop iterates through all elements preceding the current outer loop index.

  Inside the inner loop, the function checks if the current element is less than or equal to any element preceding it. If it is, the inner loop is broken, indicating that there is a subsequent element in the array that is larger than the current element.

  After the inner loop completes, the function checks if the current outer loop index is equal to the index of the inner loop. If they are equal, it means that no subsequent element in the array is larger than the current element, and the function returns -1.

  If the function completes both loops without returning -1, it means that an element that is larger than the current element exists in the array. The function returns the index of the current element in the outer loop, which is the largest index of an element that is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it.

  In the example provided, the function is called with the array [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]. The function iterates through each element in the array, and in the iteration with the element 4, the inner loop breaks because 3 is found to be greater than 4. Therefore, the function returns the index of 4, which is 2.

  The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) because of the nested for loops, where n is the length of the array. The space complexity is O(1) because no additional data structures are used.

  The code provided is a correct implementation
