To solve this problem, you can use the `map` method to iterate through the `numbers` array and insert the `delimeter` between each element. Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
const intersperse = (numbers, delimeter) => {
  return numbers.map((_, i) => [numbers[i], delimeter][i === 0 ? 0 : 1]);
};
```

The `map` method is used to create a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the array. In this case, the provided function is a ternary conditional operator that checks if the current index `i` is equal to 0. If it is, it returns the number itself, otherwise, it returns an array with the number and the delimiter.

For example, if we call `intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)`, the function will return `[1, 4, 2, 4, 3]`.

This solution ensures that the first element of the input array remains unchanged, while all other elements are interspersed with the specified delimiter.

Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

- The `map` method is used to iterate through the `numbers` array.
- For each element at index `i`, the conditional operator `(i === 0 ? 0 : 1)` is used to determine whether to return the number itself (`0`) or an array with the number and the delimiter (`1`).
- The resulting array is returned as the output of the `intersperse` function.

This approach provides a concise and efficient solution to the problem of interspersing elements in an array with a specified delimiter.
