Here's a solution:

```
const sumSquares = (lst) => {
  let total = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < lst.length; i++) {
    if (i % 3 === 0) {
      lst[i] *= lst[i];
    } else if (i % 4 === 0 && i % 3 !== 0) {
      lst[i] *= lst[i] * lst[i];
    }
    total += lst[i];
  }
  return total;
};
```

This solution starts by initializing a `total` variable to keep track of the sum of all entries in the list. Then it loops through the list using a `for` loop. For each index `i` in the list, it checks if `i` is a multiple of 3. If it is, the corresponding entry in the list is squared by multiplying it by itself. If `i` is not a multiple of 3 but is a multiple of 4, the entry is cubed by multiplying it by itself twice. The `total` is updated by adding the current entry in the list. Finally, the function returns the `total`.

This solution handles all the requirements of the problem and provides an efficient way to calculate the sum of the squares and cubes of the entries in the list based on their indices.

Here are a few test cases to validate the solution:

```
console.log(sumSquares([1, 2, 3])); // Output: 6
console.log(sumSquares([])); // Output: 0
console.log(sumSquares([-1, -5, 2, -1, -5])); // Output: -126
```

These test cases cover different scenarios, including an empty list and a list with negative numbers. The output matches the expected results from the problem statement.

Overall, this solution provides a clear and efficient way to solve the problem and obtain the desired result.
