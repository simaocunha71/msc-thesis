To solve this problem, I will follow these steps:

1. Initialize a variable `sum` to keep track of the sum of all entries in the list.
2. Iterate over the list and for each entry, check if its index is a multiple of 3 or 4.
3. If the index is a multiple of 3, square the entry and add the result to `sum`.
4. If the index is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3, cube the entry and add the result to `sum`.
5. Return the final value of `sum`.

Here's the code:

```javascript
const sumSquares = (lst) => {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < lst.length; i++) {
    const index = i + 1;
    if (index % 3 === 0) {
      sum += lst[i] ** 2;
    } else if (index % 4 === 0 && index % 3 !== 0) {
      sum += lst[i] ** 3;
    }
  }
  return sum;
};
```

Explanation:

- We initialize the variable `sum` to 0, which will keep track of the sum of all entries in the list.
- We iterate over the list using a `for` loop. For each entry, we obtain its index by adding 1 to the loop variable `i`.
- Inside the loop, we check if the index is a multiple of 3 using the modulo operator `%`. If it is, we square the entry by raising it to the power of 2 using the exponentiation operator `**`, and add the result to `sum`.
- Next, we check if the index is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3. If it is, we cube the entry by raising it to the power of 3, and add the result to `sum`.
- Finally, we return the value of `sum`, which is the sum of all modified entries in the list.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input list, as we only need to iterate over the list once. The space complexity is O(1),
