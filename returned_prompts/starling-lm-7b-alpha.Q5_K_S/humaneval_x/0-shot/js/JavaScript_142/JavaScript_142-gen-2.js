Here's a solution to the problem:

```javascript
const sumSquares = (lst) => {
  let sum = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < lst.length; i++) {
    if (i % 3 === 0) {
      lst[i] = lst[i] * lst[i];
    } else if (i % 4 === 0 && i % 3 !== 0) {
      lst[i] = lst[i] * lst[i] * lst[i];
    }
    sum += lst[i];
  }

  return sum;
};
```

The function `sumSquares` takes a list of integers as input and initializes a variable `sum` to store the sum of the modified list entries. It then iterates through each index of the input list using a for loop.

Inside the loop, it checks if the index is a multiple of 3 using the modulo operator `%`. If it is, it squares the value at that index by multiplying it by itself using the `*` operator. The squared value is then assigned back to the list at that index.

Next, it checks if the index is a multiple of 4 but not a multiple of 3 using another modulo operation. If this condition is true, it cubes the value at that index by multiplying it by itself twice. Again, the cubed value is assigned back to the list at that index.

After modifying the value at the current index, the function adds it to the `sum` variable.

Finally, the function returns the sum of all the modified list entries.

This solution ensures that the function correctly squares the entries at indices that are multiples of 3 and cubes the entries at indices that are multiples of 4 but not multiples of 3, while leaving the other entries unchanged.

Examples:

1. For `lst = [1,2,3]`, the function will modify the entry at index 2 (since 2 is a multiple of 3) by squaring it, resulting in `lst = [1,2,4]`. The sum of the modified list entries is `1 + 2 +
