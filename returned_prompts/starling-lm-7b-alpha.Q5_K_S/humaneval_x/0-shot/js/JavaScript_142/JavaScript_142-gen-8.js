Here is a possible solution:

```javascript
function sumSquares(lst) {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < lst.length; i++) {
    if (i % 3 === 0) {
      lst[i] = lst[i] ** 2;
    } else if (i % 4 === 0 && i % 3 !== 0) {
      lst[i] = lst[i] ** 3;
    }
    sum += lst[i];
  }
  return sum;
}
```

Explanation:

The function `sumSquares` takes a single parameter `lst`, which is the list of integers to be modified and summed. It initializes a variable `sum` to 0 to keep track of the sum of the modified entries in the list.

A `for` loop is used to iterate through each element in the list. Inside the loop, there are two `if` statements to check if the index of the current element is a multiple of 3 or 4.

If the index is a multiple of 3, the element is squared by raising it to the power of 2 using the exponentiation operator `**`. If the index is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3, the element is cubed by raising it to the power of 3.

After modifying the element, it is added to the `sum` variable. Once the loop finishes, the function returns the final sum of all the modified entries in the list.

The provided examples are tested against the function, and the expected outputs are obtained.

This solution modifies the original list in-place and returns the sum of all the modified entries.
