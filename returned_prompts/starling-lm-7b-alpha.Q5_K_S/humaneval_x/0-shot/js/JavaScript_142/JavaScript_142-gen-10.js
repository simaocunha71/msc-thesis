To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a variable called "sum" and set it to 0. This variable will store the sum of all the modified entries in the list.
2. Iterate through each entry in the list using a for loop or a for...of loop.
3. For each entry, check if its index is a multiple of 3. If it is, square the entry and add the result to the "sum" variable. If the index is not a multiple of 3, continue to the next step.
4. Check if the index is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3. If it is, cube the entry and add the result to the "sum" variable. If the index is not a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3, continue to the next entry.
5. After iterating through all the entries in the list, return the value of the "sum" variable.

Here's an example implementation of the solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
const sumSquares = (lst) => {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < lst.length; i++) {
    if (i % 3 === 0) {
      sum += lst[i] * lst[i];
    } else if (i % 4 === 0 && i % 3 !== 0) {
      sum += lst[i] * lst[i] * lst[i];
    }
  }
  return sum;
};
```

This implementation of the `sumSquares` function uses a for loop to iterate through each entry in the list. It checks if the index of each entry is a multiple of 3, and if so, squares the entry and adds the result to the `sum` variable. If the index is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3, it cubes the entry and adds the result to the `sum` variable. Finally, it returns the value of the `sum` variable, which is the sum of all the modified entries in the list.

You can test the `sumSquares` function with the provided examples:

```javascript
console.log(sumSquares([1, 2,
