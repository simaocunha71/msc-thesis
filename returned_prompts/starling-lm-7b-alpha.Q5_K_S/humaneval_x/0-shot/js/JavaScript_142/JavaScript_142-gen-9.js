To solve this problem, we will first initialize a variable called sum with the value 0. Then, we will loop through the list and check if the index of the current element is a multiple of 3 or 4. If it is a multiple of 3, we will square the element, and if it is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3, we will cube the element. After modifying the elements, we will add them to the sum variable. Finally, we will return the sum.

Here's an example of a function that solves the problem:

```javascript
const sumSquares = (lst) => {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < lst.length; i++) {
    if (i % 3 === 0) {
      lst[i] = lst[i] * lst[i];
    } else if (i % 4 === 0 && i % 3 !== 0) {
      lst[i] = lst[i] * lst[i] * lst[i];
    }
    sum += lst[i];
  }
  return sum;
};
```

In this function, we initialize the sum variable with 0. Then, we loop through the list using a for loop and check if the index of the current element is a multiple of 3 or 4. If it is a multiple of 3, we square the element by multiplying it by itself (lst[i] * lst[i]). If it is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3, we cube the element by multiplying it by itself and then by itself again (lst[i] * lst[i] * lst[i]). After modifying the elements, we add them to the sum variable. Finally, we return the sum.

You can test the function with the provided examples:

```javascript
console.log(sumSquares([1, 2, 3])); // Output: 6
console.log(sumSquares([])); // Output: 0
console.log(sumSquares([-1, -5, 2, -1, -5])); // Output: -126
```
