One way to solve this problem is to use a for loop to go through every item in the array. Then, check if the index of the item is a multiple of three. If it is, square the item. If the index is a multiple of four and not a multiple of three, cube the item. Otherwise, don't change the item. Finally, sum all the items in the array and return the sum.

Here is the step-by-step solution to this problem:

1. Initialize a variable called 'sum' to 0. This variable will store the sum of all the items in the array.
2. Use a for loop to go through every item in the array. For each item, do the following:
   - Check if the index of the item is a multiple of three. If it is, square the item and add the result to 'sum'. If it's not, move on to the next item.
   - Check if the index of the item is a multiple of four and not a multiple of three. If it is, cube the item and add the result to 'sum'. If it's not, move on to the next item.
   - If the index of the item is neither a multiple of three nor a multiple of four, don't change the item and move on to the next item.
3. After going through all the items in the array, return the value of 'sum'.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array.

Here is a Python implementation of this solution:

```python
def sumSquares(lst):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            lst[i] = lst[i] ** 2
        elif i % 4 == 0 and i % 3 != 0:
            lst[i] = lst[i] ** 3
        sum += lst[i]
    return sum
```

This function will work correctly for any input list of integers.
