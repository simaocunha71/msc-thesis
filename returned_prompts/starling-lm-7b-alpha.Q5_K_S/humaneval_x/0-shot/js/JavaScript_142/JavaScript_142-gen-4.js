To solve this problem we will follow the steps below:

1. Create a function called `sumSquares` that takes a list of integers as an argument.
2. Initialize a variable `total` to 0. This variable will store the sum of the modified integers.
3. Use a for loop to iterate through the list. Use the `index` parameter of the loop to check if the index is a multiple of 3 or 4.
4. If the index is a multiple of 3, square the integer entry and add the result to `total`.
5. If the index is a multiple of 4 but not a multiple of 3, cube the integer entry and add the result to `total`.
6. If the index is not a multiple of 3 or 4, leave the integer entry unchanged.
7. Return the `total` after the loop is finished.

Here's the code for the solution:

```javascript
const sumSquares = (lst) => {
  let total = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < lst.length; i++) {
    if (i % 3 === 0) {
      total += lst[i] * lst[i];
    } else if (i % 4 === 0 && i % 3 !== 0) {
      total += lst[i] * lst[i] * lst[i];
    }
  }
  return total;
};
```

Explanation:

The function `sumSquares` takes a list of integers as an argument and initializes a variable `total` to 0. This variable will store the sum of the modified integers.

We use a for loop to iterate through the list. The `index` parameter of the loop is used to check if the index is a multiple of 3 or 4.

If the index is a multiple of 3, we square the integer entry using the expression `lst[i] * lst[i]` and add the result to `total`.

If the index is a multiple of 4 but not a multiple of 3, we cube the integer entry using the expression `lst[i] * lst[i] * lst[i]
