To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize an empty string called `binary` to store the binary representation of the number.
2. While the `decimal` number is greater than 0, do the following:
   - Calculate the modulus of the `decimal` number by 2 (i.e., the remainder when divided by 2) and convert it to a string. Store it in a variable called `remainder`.
   - Append the `remainder` string to the beginning of the `binary` string.
   - Update the `decimal` number by dividing it by 2 (i.e., `decimal = Math.floor(decimal / 2)`).
3. Once the loop is finished, prepend the characters "db" to the beginning and end of the `binary` string.
4. Return the modified `binary` string.

Here's the code implementation:

```javascript
const decimalToBinary = (decimal) => {
  let binary = "";

  while (decimal > 0) {
    let remainder = (decimal % 2).toString();
    binary = remainder + binary;
    decimal = Math.floor(decimal / 2);
  }

  binary = "db" + binary + "db";
  return binary;
};
```

This implementation ensures that the binary representation is correctly formed with the extra "db" characters at the beginning and end of the string.

Note: The `Math.floor()` function is used to round down the decimal part of the division to the nearest whole number, ensuring that the `decimal` variable is always an integer during the calculation.

You can test this function with different decimal values, such as `decimalToBinary(15)` and `decimalToBinary(32)`, to verify that it returns the correct binary representation.

*/

decimalToBinary(15); // returns "db1111db"
decimalToBinary(32); // returns "db100000db"
```

The `decimalToBinary` function takes a decimal number as an argument and converts it to its binary representation. It uses a while loop to repeatedly divide the decimal number by 2 and
