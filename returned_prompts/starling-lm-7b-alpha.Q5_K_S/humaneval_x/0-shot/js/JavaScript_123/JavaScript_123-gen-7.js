The provided code defines a function named `getOddCollatz` that takes in a positive integer `n` and returns a sorted list of odd numbers in the Collatz sequence.

To achieve this, the function initializes an array `arr` with the input `n`. It then enters a while loop that continues until `arr[arr.length - 1]` is equal to 1. Within the loop, it checks if the last element of `arr` is even or odd. If it's even, the function appends half of the last element to the array. If it's odd, the function appends three times the last element plus one to the array.

After the loop, the function uses the `filter` method on `arr` to create a new array that only contains odd numbers. It does this by checking if each element is odd using the condition `val % 2 === 1`. Finally, the function uses the `sort` method on the filtered array to sort the odd numbers in ascending order.

To test the function, you can call it with a sample input, such as `getOddCollatz(5)`, which will return `[1, 5]`.

Overall, the provided code effectively solves the problem of finding the sorted list of odd numbers in the Collatz sequence.

// Time Complexity: O(log(n))
// Space Complexity: O(log(n))

*/

// Further Explanation:

// The time complexity of this solution is O(log(n)) because the while loop will iterate approximately log(n) times until it reaches 1. This is because each iteration effectively divides the value by 2, which is a common operation
