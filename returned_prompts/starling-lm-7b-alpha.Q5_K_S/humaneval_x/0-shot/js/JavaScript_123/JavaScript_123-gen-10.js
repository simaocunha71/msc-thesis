The provided code defines a function `getOddCollatz` that takes a positive integer `n` as an input and returns a sorted list of odd numbers in the Collatz sequence. Here's a detailed explanation of the code:

1. The function initializes an empty array `res` to store the odd numbers in the Collatz sequence. It also initializes an empty array `seq` to store all the numbers in the sequence.
2. The code enters a `while` loop that continues until the value of `n` becomes 1.
3. Inside the `while` loop, the current value of `n` is pushed to the `seq` array.
4. The code then checks if the current value of `n` is odd (i.e., `n % 2 === 1`). If it's odd, the code pushes the current value of `n` to the `res` array and updates the value of `n` by multiplying it by 3 and adding 1 (`n = 3 * n + 1`).
5. If the current value of `n` is even, the code simply updates the value of `n` by dividing it by 2 (`n = n / 2`).
6. Once the `while` loop is exited (i.e., when `n` becomes 1), the code pushes the final value of `n` to the `res` array.
7. Finally, the `res` array is sorted in ascending order using the `sort` method and the `(a, b) => a - b` compare function. The sorted array is then returned as the result.

This function follows the Collatz sequence algorithm and ensures that the returned list of odd numbers is sorted in increasing order.
