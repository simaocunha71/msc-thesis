To solve this, I would use a set to store all the odd numbers in the Collatz sequence. Then, I would iterate through the sequence and for each even number, I would add its half to the set. For each odd number, I would add its three times plus one to the set. Finally, I would return the set in increasing order.

Here's how this approach would look in Python:

def getOddCollatz(n):
    # Create an empty set to store the odd numbers in the Collatz sequence.
    odd_numbers = set()

    # Iterate through the Collatz sequence starting from the given number.
    for i in range(n, 1, -1):
        # If the current number is odd, add its three times plus one to the set.
        if i % 2 != 0:
            odd_numbers.add(3 * i + 1)
        # If the current number is even, add its half to the set.
        else:
            odd_numbers.add(i // 2)

    # Return the set in increasing order.
    return sorted(odd_numbers)

This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the length of the Collatz sequence.

The space complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the Collatz sequence. This is because we are storing all the odd numbers in the sequence in a set, which can have at most n elements.

However, the provided JavaScript code has a different approach. It uses a while loop to generate the Collatz sequence for the given number until it reaches 1. Then, it uses a for loop to iterate through the sequence and pushes the odd numbers to an array. Finally, it sorts the array and returns it.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the Collatz sequence. This is because we are iterating through the sequence once to generate it and once to find the odd numbers.

The space complexity of this solution is also O(n), where n is the length of the Collatz sequence. This is because we are storing all the odd numbers in an array, which can have at most n elements.

Here's how this approach would look in Python:
