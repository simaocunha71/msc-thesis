```
  let arr = [];
  let i = n;

  while (i !== 1) {
    if (i % 2 === 1) {
      arr.push(i);
    }
    if (i % 2 === 0) {
      i /= 2;
    } else {
      i = 3 * i + 1;
    }
  }

  return [...new Set(arr)].sort((a, b) => a - b);
```

I'm wondering if there are any ways to optimize this function.

For example, I think we can add a check to see if the current `i` is already in the array, but it's not clear to me how to implement it.

Here's a working example of the code:

```javascript
console.log(getOddCollatz(5)); // [1, 5]
```

Explanation:

In this solution, we initialize an empty array `arr` to store the odd numbers in the collatz sequence. We also initialize a variable `i` with the input value `n`.

We then enter a `while` loop that continues until `i` becomes 1. Inside the loop, we check if `i` is odd using the modulo operator `%`. If it is odd, we push `i` into the `arr` array.

Next, we check if `i` is even. If it is even, we divide `i` by 2. If it is odd, we multiply `i` by 3 and add 1.

After updating `i`, we check if it is already in the `arr` array using the `Set` object. If it is, we skip adding it to the array again. Finally, we sort the `arr` array in increasing order using the `sort` method and the spread syntax `[...new Set(arr)]`.

Overall, this solution efficiently finds and sorts the odd numbers in the collatz sequence while avoiding duplicate entries.

One optimization we can make is to add a check to see if the current `i` is already in the `arr` array. However, it's not clear how to implement this check in a concise way.
