The function `getOddCollatz` takes a positive integer `n` as an argument and returns a sorted list of odd numbers in the collatz sequence. It initializes an empty array `result` to store the odd numbers. 

The function uses a while loop to iterate until `n` becomes 1. Inside the loop, it checks if `n` is odd using the modulo operator `%`. If `n` is odd, it pushes `n` to the `result` array. Then, it updates `n` based on the collatz sequence rules: if `n` is odd, it multiplies `n` by 3 and adds 1; if `n` is even, it divides `n` by 2.

After the loop, the function sorts the `result` array in increasing order using the `sort` method and a compare function that subtracts `a` from `b`. Finally, it returns the sorted `result` array.

In the example, `getOddCollatz(5)` is called and it returns `[1, 5]`, which are the odd numbers in the collatz sequence for 5.
