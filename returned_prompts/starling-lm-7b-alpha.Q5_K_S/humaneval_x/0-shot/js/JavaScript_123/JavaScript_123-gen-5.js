In the Collatz conjecture, the sequence is defined as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.

To solve this problem, we can iterate through the Collatz sequence until we reach 1. For each iteration, if the number is odd, we push it into the array. Then, we sort the array in increasing order and return it.

For example, when we call getOddCollatz(5), it will return [1, 5] because the Collatz sequence for 5 is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1], and the odd numbers in this sequence are only 1 and 5.

Here is the code to solve this problem:

```javascript
function getOddCollatz(n) {
    let arr = [];
    while (n !== 1) {
        if (n % 2 === 1) {
            arr.push(n);
        }
        if (n % 2 === 0) {
            n = n / 2;
        }
        if (n % 2 === 1) {
            n = 3 * n + 1;
        }
    }
    arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    return arr;
}
```
