To solve this problem, you need to write a function that takes a list as an argument and returns a new list that meets the requirements. Here's a step-by-step guide to solving this problem:

1. First, define a function called `sortEven` that takes a list `l` as an argument.
2. Create a new list called `l_even` that only contains the elements from `l` at the even indices. You can use the `map` function to achieve this. The `map` function applies a function to each element of an array and returns a new array with the results. In this case, the function should return the element at the even index of `l`. You can use the modulo operator (`%`) to check if the index is even. If the index is even, return the element at that index. Otherwise, return `undefined`.
3. Create a new list called `l_odd` that only contains the elements from `l` at the odd indices. You can use the same approach as with `l_even`. The function should return the element at the odd index of `l`.
4. Sort the `l_even` list using the `sort` function. This function sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the sorted array.
5. Combine the sorted `l_even` list with the `l_odd` list using the `concat` function. The `concat` function takes two or more arrays and returns a new array containing all the elements of the original arrays.
6. Return the concatenated array as the result.

Here's the code for the `sortEven` function:

```javascript
const sortEven = (l) => {
  const l_even = l.map((_, i) => i % 2 === 0 ? l[i] : undefined);
  const l_odd = l.map((_, i) => i % 2 !== 0 ? l[i] : undefined);
  l_even.sort();
  return l_even.concat(l_odd);
};
```

You can test the function with the provided test cases:

```javascript
console.log(sortEven([1, 2, 3])); // [1, 2, 3]
console.log(sortEven([5, 6,
