To Gain More Knowledge:
• Understand what the filter method does in the JavaScript programming language.
• Understand the concept of even and odd indicies in an array.
• Learn how to use the spread operator in JavaScript to merge arrays.

• Even and odd indicies in an array refer to the positions of the array elements. The first element is at index 0, which is an odd index, the second element is at index 1, which is an even index, the third element is at index 2, which is an odd index, and so on.

• In JavaScript, the filter method is used to create a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.

• The spread operator is used to expand the elements of an iterable object (like an array) into individual elements.

• The sort method is used to sort the elements of an array in place and returns the sorted array.

• The sort method sorts the array in lexicographical order using String.prototype.localeCompare(b, locale) as the default compare function. If the array contains objects, the sort method will consider the string representation of the object as the default compare function.

• The sort method can also take a compare function as an argument to specify how the array is to be sorted. The compare function should return a negative value if a should be sorted before b, a positive value if a should be sorted after b, or zero if a and b are equal.

The sortEven function first filters the given array l into two separate arrays: one containing the elements at even indicies (even) and one containing the elements at odd indicies (odd). It then merges these two arrays using the spread operator, placing the odd array first, followed by the sorted even array. Finally, it returns the merged array, which is the modified version of the original array with the even elements sorted.

For example, when the function is called with the argument [5, 6, 3, 4], it filters the array into two separate arrays: [3] and [5, 6,
