/*
The function stringXor() takes in two strings a and b as inputs. It initializes an empty string result.

The function uses a for loop to iterate through the characters of the strings a and b simultaneously. It compares the corresponding characters at each index of the two strings.

If the characters at the current index are the same (either both '0' or both '1'), the function appends '0' to the result string. Otherwise, if the characters at the current index are different (one is '0' and the other is '1'), the function appends '1' to the result string.

After iterating through all the characters of the input strings, the function returns the result string, which represents the binary XOR of the input strings.

In the provided example, the function is called with the arguments '010' and '110'. The function correctly performs the binary XOR operation on these inputs and returns the result '100'.
