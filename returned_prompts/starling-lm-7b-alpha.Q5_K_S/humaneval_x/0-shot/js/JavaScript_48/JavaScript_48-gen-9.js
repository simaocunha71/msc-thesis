To check if a string is a palindrome, we can compare the first and last character of the string. If they are the same, we move to the next pair of characters until we reach the middle of the string. If at any point the characters are not the same, the string is not a palindrome, and we return false. If we make it all the way to the middle of the string, it means all of the characters were the same, and we return true.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Check if the length of the string is 0 or 1. If it is, return true, as an empty string and a string with one character are both palindromes.

2. Use a for loop to iterate through the string. Start from the first character (index 0) and go up to the second-to-last character (index length - 2).

3. Inside the loop, compare the current character (text[i]) with the character at the corresponding position from the end of the string (text[length - 1 - i]).

4. If the characters are not the same, return false, as the string is not a palindrome.

5. If the loop completes without finding any mismatched characters, return true, as the string is a palindrome.

In this solution, we use the modulus operator (%) to calculate the middle index of the string. This works even if the length of the string is odd. The modulus operator returns the remainder of the division, so if the length is odd, the middle index will be length / 2. Otherwise, it will be (length - 1) / 2.

Here's the code for the solution:

```javascript
const isPalindrome = (text) => {
  if (text.length === 0 || text.length === 1) {
    return true;
  }

  const length = text.length;
  for (let i = 0; i < length / 2; i++) {
    if (text[i] !== text[length - 1 - i]) {
      return false;
    }
  }

  return true;
};
```

You can test the function with different strings by using the console
