To determine if a string is a palindrome, we can compare the first and last characters in the string, then the second and second-to-last characters, and so on until we reach the middle of the string. If all of these pairs are equal, then the string is a palindrome.

In this code, we start by checking if the length of the string is zero or one. If it is, we return true because an empty string and a string with just one character are both considered palindromes.

Next, we check if the first and last characters of the string are equal. If they are, we remove the first and last characters from the string and repeat the process on the remaining string. We continue doing this until we reach the middle of the string.

If at any point the first and last characters are not equal, we return false because the string is not a palindrome.

Finally, if we have checked all pairs of characters and they are all equal, we return true because the string is a palindrome.

Here's an example usage of the `isPalindrome` function:

```javascript
console.log(isPalindrome(''));       // true
console.log(isPalindrome('aba'));    // true
console.log(isPalindrome('aaaaa'));  // true
console.log(isPalindrome('zbcd'));   // false
```

The `isPalindrome` function can be used to check if a given string is a palindrome or not.
