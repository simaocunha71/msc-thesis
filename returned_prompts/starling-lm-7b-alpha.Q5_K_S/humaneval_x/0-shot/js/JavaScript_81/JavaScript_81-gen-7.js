To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Define a function called `numericalLetterGrade` that takes an array of GPAs as its argument.
2. Create an empty array called `result` to store the letter grades.
3. Use the `forEach` method to iterate over each GPA in the `grades` array.
4. Inside the loop, use conditional statements (if-else) to determine the letter grade based on the GPA. If the GPA falls within a certain range, push the corresponding letter grade to the `result` array.
5. Once all GPAs have been processed, return the `result` array.
6. Call the `numericalLetterGrade` function with an example array of GPAs (e.g., `[4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3
