To solve this problem, I will follow these steps:

1. Convert the number to a string.
2. If the shift is greater than the length of the string, reverse the string.
3. Slice the string to create a new string with the first character shifted to the end.
4. If the original length of the string is greater than the shift, concatenate the sliced string with the rest of the original string. Otherwise, return the sliced string as the result.

Here's the code to implement these steps:

```javascript
const circularShift = (x, shift) => {
  const str = x.toString();
  const reversed = str.length < shift ? str.split('').reverse().join('') : str;
  const sliced = str.slice(1) + str[0];
  return sliced.length < shift ? sliced : sliced + reversed.slice(shift);
};
```

This code first converts the input number `x` to a string using the `toString()` method. If the length of the string is less than the shift value, it reverses the string using the `reverse()` method on the split string, and joins it back into a string using the `join()` method.

Then, it slices the string to create a new string with the first character shifted to the end using the `slice()` method. If the length of the sliced string is less than the shift value, it returns the sliced string as the result. Otherwise, it concatenates the sliced string with the remaining part of the original string after the shift using the `slice()` method.

You can test this implementation with the provided test cases:

```javascript
console.log(circularShift(12, 1)); // "21"
console.log(circularShift(12, 2)); // "12"
```

The first test case `circularShift(12, 1)` should return "21", as the first digit is shifted to the end of the string. The second test case `circularShift(12, 2)` should return "12", as the first two digits are shifted to the end of the string.

This implementation ensures that the digits are shifted
