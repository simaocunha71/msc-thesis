One approach to solve this problem is to convert the number to a string, slice off the first n characters, concatenate them at the end, and return the resulting string. However, this approach fails for cases like circularShift(123, 2), which should return '312' instead of '231'.

To solve this problem correctly, we can use the following steps:

1. Convert the number to a string using the toString() method.
2. Calculate the length of the string using the length property.
3. Check if the shift value is greater than or equal to the length of the string. If it is, reverse the string using the split(), reverse(), and join() methods, and return the result.
4. If the shift value is less than the length of the string, convert the string back to a number using the Number() method, perform the circular shift by shifting the digits right by shift positions, and return the result as a string using the toString() method.

Here is the code that implements the above steps:

```javascript
const circularShift = (x, shift) => {
  const str = x.toString();
  const len = str.length;

  if (shift >= len) {
    return str.split('').reverse().join('');
  }

  const shifted = Number(str.slice(shift)) + Number(str.slice(0, shift));
  return shifted.toString();
};
```

You can verify the correctness of this solution by running the provided test cases.

To understand the code, let's go through it step by step:

- The function `circularShift` takes two parameters: `x`, the number to be shifted, and `shift`, the number of positions to shift the digits.
- Inside the function, the number `x` is converted to a string using the `toString()` method and stored in the variable `str`. The length of the string is also calculated and stored in the variable `len`.
- The function checks if the `shift` value is greater than or equal to the length of the string. If it is, the string is reversed using the `split('')`, `reverse()`, and `join('')` methods, and the result is returned.
- If the `shift` value is less than the
