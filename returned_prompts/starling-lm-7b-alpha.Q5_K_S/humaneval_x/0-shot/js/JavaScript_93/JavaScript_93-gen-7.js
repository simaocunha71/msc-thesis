To encode a message, the function first defines an array of vowels and the alphabet. It then initializes an empty string called `result` to store the encoded message. 

Next, the function loops through each character in the input `message`. For each character, it checks if it is one of the vowels in the `vowels` array using the `includes()` method. If the character is a vowel, it finds its index in the `alphabet` string using the `indexOf()` method, adds 2 to the index (to replace the vowel with the letter 2 places ahead), and takes the modulus of 26 to ensure the index stays within the range of the alphabet. It then appends the corresponding letter from the `alphabet` string to the `result` string. 

If the character is not a vowel, it appends the uppercase version of the character to the `result` string. 

Finally, the function returns the `result` string, which contains the encoded message.

For example, when the function is called with the message "test", it replaces the "t" with "T", the "e" with "G", the "s" with "S", and the "t" with "T", resulting in the encoded message "TGST".

Similarly, when the function is called with the message "This is a message", it replaces the "t" with "t", the "h" with "K", the "i" with "S", the space with a space, the "s" with "C", the "a" with "M", the "m" with "G
