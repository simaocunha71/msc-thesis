We need to find a way to empty all the wells with buckets.
Let's start by finding the maximum number of times we can lower the bucket in a single well.

Let's take a single well with a number of 1's equal to capacity.
We can lower the bucket in this well capacity times.

Now let's think of a well with a number of 1's equal to k * capacity, where k is an integer.
Since the bucket's capacity is fixed, we can lower the bucket in this well k times.

The same logic can be applied to any well with a number of 1's equal to l * capacity, where l is an integer.

Therefore, we can lower the bucket in any well with a number of 1's equal to capacity times.

Now let's think of the grid as a whole.
We can lower the bucket in a grid with a total number of 1's equal to capacity times the number of wells.

Therefore, we can lower the bucket in a grid with a total number of 1's equal to capacity times the number of wells.

The number of wells is equal to the length of the grid.

The total number of 1's in a grid is equal to the sum of 1's in each row.

Therefore, we can lower the bucket in a grid with a total number of 1's equal to capacity times the length of the grid.

Now let's think of the grid as a whole.
We can lower the bucket in a grid with a total number of 1's equal to capacity times the number of wells.

Therefore, we can lower the bucket in a grid with a total number of 1's equal to capacity times the length of the grid.

The number of wells is equal to the length of the grid.

The total number of 1's in a grid is equal to the sum of 1's in each row.

Therefore, we can lower the bucket in a grid with a total number of 1's equal to capacity times the length of the grid.

Now let's think of the grid as a whole.
We can lower the bucket in a grid with a total number of 1's equal
