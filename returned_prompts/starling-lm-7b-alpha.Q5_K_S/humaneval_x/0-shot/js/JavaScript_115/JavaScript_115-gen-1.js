One approach is to iterate through the grid and calculate the number of times we can fill the bucket for each well. Then, add up all the values.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize a variable `total` to store the total number of times we need to lower the buckets.

2. Iterate through the grid using a nested loop. For each grid cell, calculate the number of times we can fill the bucket. To do this, divide the cell's value by the `capacity` and round down the result using the `Math.floor()` function. Multiply this result by the `capacity` to get the total number of units of water removed from the cell. Add this value to the `total` variable.

3. After iterating through all the grid cells, return the `total` variable as the result.

Here's the implementation of the solution in Python:

```python
def maxFill(grid, capacity):
    total = 0
    for row in grid:
        for cell in row:
            total += (cell // capacity) * capacity
    return total
```

The time complexity of this solution is O(m * n), where m is the number of rows in the grid and n is the number of columns. This is because we need to iterate through each grid cell exactly once.

The space complexity is also O(m * n), as we need to store the grid in memory.

Overall, this solution provides an efficient way to calculate the minimum number of times needed to lower the buckets to empty the wells.
