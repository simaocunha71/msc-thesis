To solve this problem, we can start by iterating over the grid and summing up all the 1s in each row. This gives us the total amount of water in each row. We store these values in an array called "totalWaterInRow". Then, we initialize a variable called "sum" to 0. This variable will keep track of the total number of times we need to lower the bucket.

Next, we iterate over each row in the grid. For each row, we check if the total amount of water in that row is greater than the bucket capacity. If it is, we subtract the bucket capacity from the total water in that row and add the result to the "sum" variable. We repeat this process until the total water in the row is less than or equal to the bucket capacity.

Finally, we return the value of the "sum" variable, which represents the total number of times we need to lower the bucket to empty all the wells.

Here is an example implementation of the solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
const maxFill = (grid, capacity) => {
  let totalWaterInRow = [];
  let sum = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
    let totalWater = 0;

    for (let j = 0; j < grid[i].length; j++) {
      totalWater += grid[i][j];
    }

    totalWaterInRow[i] = totalWater;
  }

  for (let i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
    if (totalWaterInRow[i] > capacity) {
      while (totalWaterInRow[i] > capacity) {
        totalWaterInRow[i] -= capacity;
        sum++;
      }
    }
  }

  return sum;
};
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(m * n), where m is the number of rows in the grid and n is the number of columns in each row. The space complexity is O(m), as we need to store the total water in each row in the "totalWaterInRow" array.

Overall, this solution effectively uses buckets to empty the wells in the minimum number of iterations, while considering
