To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize a variable `fill` to store the number of times we need to lower the buckets, starting from 0.
2. Initialize a variable `remainingWater` to store the remaining water in the grid, which is the sum of all the 1s in the grid.
3. Initialize a variable `row` to keep track of the current row we are processing, starting from 0.
4. Initialize a variable `col` to keep track of the current column in the current row, starting from 0.
5. While `remainingWater` is greater than 0, perform the following steps:
    a. While the `col` is less than the length of the current row, perform the following steps:
        i. If the value at `grid[row][col]` is 1, perform the following steps:
            - If the `remainingWater` is less than or equal to `capacity`, we can empty all the wells with the current capacity. So, we can decrease `fill` by 1 and decrease `remainingWater` by `capacity`. Then, we can move to the next column in the same row.
            - Else, we can only empty some of the wells with the current capacity. So, we can decrease `fill` by 1 and decrease `remainingWater` by `capacity`. Then, we can move to the next column in the same row.
        ii. If the value at `grid[row][col]` is 0, we don't need to do anything. So, we can move to the next column in the same row.
    b. If we have finished processing all the columns in the current row, we can move to the next row and reset the `col` to 0.
    c. If we have finished processing all the rows, we can break out of the loop, as all the wells have been emptied.
6. Finally, we can return the `fill`.

Here is an example implementation of the above algorithm in JavaScript:

```javascript
const maxFill = (grid, capacity) => {
  let fill = 0;
  let remainingWater = grid.reduce((acc, row) => acc + row.reduce((acc, col) => acc + col, 0), 0);
