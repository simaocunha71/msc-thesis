To solve this problem, we can use a modified version of the greedy algorithm.
We start by calculating the maximum number of buckets needed to empty the wells in the grid.
We can do this by iterating over the grid and summing up the number of buckets needed for each well.
Once we have the total number of buckets needed, we can then distribute them among the wells in the grid based on their capacity.
We can do this by iterating over the grid and distributing the buckets among the wells in the grid based on their capacity.
Finally, we can calculate the number of times we need to lower the buckets by dividing the total number of buckets needed by the capacity of the bucket.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

1. Calculate the maximum number of buckets needed to empty the wells in the grid by iterating over the grid and summing up the number of buckets needed for each well.
2. Distribute the buckets among the wells in the grid based on their capacity by iterating over the grid and distributing the buckets among the wells in the grid based on their capacity.
3. Calculate the number of times we need to lower the buckets by dividing the total number of buckets needed by the capacity of the bucket.

Here is a Python implementation of the algorithm:

```python
def maxFill(grid, capacity):
    # Calculate the maximum number of buckets needed to empty the wells in the grid
    buckets_needed = sum([sum(row) for row in grid])
    
    # Distribute the buckets among the wells in the grid based on their capacity
    for row in grid:
        while buckets_needed > 0 and sum(row) > 0:
            for i in range(len(row)):
                if row[i] > 0 and buckets_needed > 0:
                    row[i] -= 1
                    buckets_needed -= 1
                    if buckets_needed == 0:
                        break
    return buckets_needed / capacity
```

This implementation first calculates the maximum number of buckets needed to empty the wells in the grid by iterating over the grid
