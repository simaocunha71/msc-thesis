One possible solution is to find the maximum number of times you can fill the bucket from a single well,
then multiply this number by the number of wells with the maximum number of units of water.
Here's the step-by-step logic:

1. Initialize a variable `max_units_well` to track the maximum number of units of water in a well.
2. Initialize a variable `max_num_wells` to track the number of wells with the maximum number of units of water.
3. Iterate through each row of the `grid` array.
4. For each row, iterate through each element of the row.
5. If the element is `1`, increment `max_units_well` by `1`.
6. After iterating through each row, if `max_units_well` is divisible by `capacity`, increment `max_num_wells` by the integer division of `max_units_well` by `capacity`.
7. Initialize a variable `max_fills` to track the maximum number of times you can fill the bucket.
8. If `max_num_wells` is `0`, set `max_fills` to `0`.
9. Otherwise, set `max_fills` to the integer division of `max_units_well` by `capacity`.
10. Return `max_fills` multiplied by the total number of wells.

Here's the step-by-step logic in code:

```javascript
function maxFill(grid, capacity) {
  let max_units_well = 0;
  let max_num_wells = 0;

  for (let row of grid) {
    for (let unit of row) {
      if (unit === 1) {
        max_units_well += 1;
      }
    }
  }

  if (max_units_well % capacity === 0) {
    max_num_wells = Math.floor(max_units_well / capacity);
  }

  let max_fills = 0;
  if (max_num_wells > 0) {
    max_fills = Math.floor(max_units_well / capacity);
  }
