const result = values.filter(value => typeof value === 'number' && Math.floor(value) === value);
return result;

Explanation:
The function filterIntegers takes an array of values as an argument and returns a new array that only includes the integer values from the original array. The filter() method is used to create a new array with all the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. In this case, the test is whether the value is of type number and whether it is an integer (by checking if the floor of the value is equal to the value). The resulting array is then returned.

For example, when the function is called with the array ['a', 3.14, 5], the filter() method will only keep the value 5 in the new array, as it is the only integer in the original array. The resulting array will be [5].

Similarly, when the function is called with the array [1, 2, 3, 'abc', {}], the filter() method will keep the values 1, 2, and 3 in the new array, as they are the only integer values in the original array. The resulting array will be [1, 2, 3].

The function uses the typeof operator to check if a value is of type number, and the Math.floor() method to check if a value is an integer (as the floor of an integer is equal to the integer itself).

Overall, this function provides a simple and effective way to filter out non-integer values from an array of any python values, including numbers, strings, objects, and empty arrays.

// Test cases
console.log(filterIntegers(['a', 3.14, 5])); // [5]
console.log(filterIntegers([1, 2, 3, 'abc', {}])); // [1, 2, 3]
