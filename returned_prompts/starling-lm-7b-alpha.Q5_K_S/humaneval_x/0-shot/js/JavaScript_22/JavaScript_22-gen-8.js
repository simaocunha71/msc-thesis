const result = values.filter(value => typeof value === 'number' && value === Math.round(value));
return result;

Explanation:
The function `filterIntegers` takes in an array `values` as an argument.

We use the `filter` method on the array to iterate through each value in the `values` array.
For each value, we use the `typeof` operator to check if the value is of type `number`.
We also use the strict equality operator (`===`) to ensure that the value is an integer (i.e., the value rounded to the nearest whole number is equal to the original value).

The `filter` method returns a new array containing only the values that pass the filter condition.
This new array is assigned to the `result` variable, which is then returned by the function.

The code uses `typeof value === 'number'` to filter out non-number values, and `value === Math.round(value)` to filter out non-integer values (i.e., values that are not whole numbers).

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array, as we have to iterate through each value in the array once using the `filter` method.

The space complexity is also O(n) as the `filter` method creates a new array with the filtered values, which can have a maximum size of n if all values pass the filter condition.

Overall, this solution has a time and space complexity of O(n).
