const result = values.filter(item => typeof item === 'number' && !isNaN(item) && item % 1 === 0);
return result;

Explanation: The function filterIntegers takes in an array of values as its parameter. Inside the function, the filter method is used on the values array. The filter method takes in a callback function as a parameter. The callback function is used to determine whether an item should be included in the filtered result. In this case, the callback function checks if the item is of type number and is an integer (i.e., it is not a floating-point number). If both conditions are met, the item is included in the result. The result is then returned by the function.

To test the function, you can use the following code:
```
console.log(filterIntegers(['a', 3.14, 5])); // Output: [5]
console.log(filterIntegers([1, 2, 3, 'abc', {}, []])); // Output: [1, 2, 3]
```

The first test case checks if the function correctly filters out all non-integer values from the input array ['a', 3.14, 5]. The expected output is [5], which is the only integer value in the array. 

The second test case checks if the function correctly filters out all non-integer values from the input array [1, 2, 3, 'abc', {}, []]. The expected output is [1, 2, 3], which are the only integer values in the array. 

By running these test cases, you can verify that the function correctly filters out all non-integer values from the input array.
