const result = values.filter(value => {
  return typeof value === 'number' && !Number.isFinite(value);
});
return result;

Explanation:
The function filterIntegers takes an array of values as an argument. It uses the filter() method to create a new array containing only the values that pass a specific test implemented by the provided function.

In this case, the function checks if each value is of type 'number' and if it is not finite (i.e., an integer). If both conditions are true, the value is included in the new array. Otherwise, it is excluded.

The function returns the new array with only the integer values.

To test the function, you can use the print statements provided as examples. The first print statement filters the given list of values and only includes the integer value 5. The second print statement filters the given list of values and includes the integer values 1, 2, and 3.

Overall, this function can be used to filter a list of values to only include integers.
