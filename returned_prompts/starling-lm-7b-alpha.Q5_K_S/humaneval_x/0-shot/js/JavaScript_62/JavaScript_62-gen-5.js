To derive the polynomial of the form xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + .... We need to multiply the current coefficient with the power of x by the current power minus 1.

For example, if the current coefficient is xs[2] and the current power is 2, then the next coefficient will be xs[2] * (2-1) = 2 * xs[2]. We should repeat this process for all coefficients in the array.

To implement the above logic in JavaScript, you can use the `map` method to create a new array with the same length as the original array. In each iteration of the `map` method, you can multiply the current coefficient by the current power minus one.

Here's how you can implement the logic:

```javascript
const derivative = (xs) => {
  return xs.map((coeff, i) => coeff * (i + 1));
};
```

This function will return the derivative of the polynomial in the same format as the input array.

For example, if you pass `[3, 1, 2, 4, 5]` to the function, it will return `[1, 4, 12, 20]`. And if you pass `[1, 2, 3]`, it will return `[2, 6]`.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.

Here's the code for the solution:

```javascript
const derivative = (xs) => {
  return xs.map((coeff, i) => coeff * (i + 1));
};
```

And here are some test cases to verify the correctness of the function:

```javascript
console.log(derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])); // [1, 4, 12, 20]
console.log(derivative([1, 2, 3])); // [2, 6]
```

These test cases should output the expected results.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.
