Here is a step by step logic to solve this problem:

1. We know that derivative of ax^n is n*ax^(n-1). Hence we can create a new array by multiplying every element with its index + 1.
2. The last element of the array will be the first element of the derivative. So return it as the derivative array.
3. The second last element of the array will be the second element of the derivative. So return it as the derivative array. Repeat the process till the second element of the original array.
4. The first element of the array will be zero as it is the last element of the derivative array.
5. Return the derived array.

Let's write the code:

```javascript
// Using the logic explained above, we can solve this problem as follows:

const derivative = (xs) => {
  // Create a new array by multiplying every element with its index + 1
  const result = xs.map((x, i) => x * (i + 1));

  // The last element of the array will be the first element of the derivative.
  // So return it as the derivative array.
  return result.slice(1);
};
```
In this way we can derive a polynomial.

To verify the code, you can use the following test cases:

```javascript
console.log(derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])); // [1, 4, 12, 20]
console.log(derivative([1, 2, 3])); // [2, 6]
```

These test cases will return the expected result.

This is how you can solve this problem.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) because we are iterating through the array once. The space complexity is also O(n) because the size of the resultant array is equal to the size of the input array.

Hope this helps!
