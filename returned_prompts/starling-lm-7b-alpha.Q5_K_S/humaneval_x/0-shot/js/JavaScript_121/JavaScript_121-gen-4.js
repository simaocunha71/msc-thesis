The solution starts by initializing a variable `sum` to 0, which will store the sum of the odd elements in even positions of the input list.

Then, a `for` loop is used to iterate through each element of the input list. The loop starts with `i = 0` and continues until `i` is less than the length of the list. The loop increments `i` by 1 after each iteration.

Inside the loop, an `if` statement checks if the current index `i` is divisible by 2 (i.e., even position) and if the value at that index is odd (i.e., the remainder of the division by 2 is 1). If both conditions are true, the value at that index is added to the `sum` variable.

Finally, the function returns the `sum` variable, which contains the sum of all the odd elements in even positions of the input list.

The code is then executed by calling the `solution` function with different input lists, and the results are printed to the console using `console.log`.

The output of the code is as follows:

12
9
0

This means that the `solution` function correctly calculates the sum of the odd elements in even positions for each of the input lists provided.
