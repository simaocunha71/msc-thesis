The result of the code is 12.

Explanation:
The code defines a function called `solution` that takes a list of integers as an argument. The function uses the `filter` method to filter out elements at even positions (indexes) from the list. Then, the `reduce` method is used to calculate the sum of the odd elements. Finally, the result is printed to the console using `console.log`.

To test the function, the code calls `solution` with the list `[5, 8, 7, 1]`. The expected result is 12, as the odd elements at even positions (7) are added together.

The correct answer is: 
12

This explanation is provided to assist you in understanding the code and its result. The provided code is functional and will produce the expected output.
