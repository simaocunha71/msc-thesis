The solution is a function named "solution" that takes in a list of integers as an argument. It initializes a variable "sum" to 0, which will store the sum of all odd elements in even positions.

The function then uses a for loop to iterate through each element in the input list. Inside the loop, it checks if the current element is odd (by using the modulo operator) and if the index of the element is even (by using the modulo operator). If both conditions are true, it adds the element to the sum variable.

After iterating through all elements in the list, the function returns the value of the sum variable, which is the sum of all odd elements in even positions.

The provided test cases demonstrate the usage of the solution function and verify that it correctly calculates the sum of odd elements in even positions.
