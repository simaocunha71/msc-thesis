To solve this problem, we first need to find the middle index of the array. If the length of the array is even, then the middle index will be the average of the two middle indices. Next, we need to create two new arrays, one containing the elements from the middle index to the end of the array, and the other containing the elements from the beginning of the array to the middle index (exclusive). We then use the `map` method to create new arrays with the elements reversed. Finally, we use the `reduce` method to calculate the number of differences between the original array and the reversed arrays, and return that number.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Find the middle index of the array. If the length of the array is even, calculate the middle index as the average of the two middle indices.

```javascript
let mid = Math.floor(arr.length / 2);
```

2. Create two new arrays, one containing the elements from the middle index to the end of the array, and the other containing the elements from the beginning of the array to the middle index (exclusive).

```javascript
let leftArr = arr.slice(0, mid);
let rightArr = arr.slice(mid);
```

3. Use the `map` method to create new arrays with the elements reversed.

```javascript
let leftRev = leftArr.map((_, i) => leftArr[leftArr.length - i - 1]);
let rightRev = rightArr.map((_, i) => rightArr[rightArr.length - i - 1]);
```

4. Use the `reduce` method to calculate the number of differences between the original array and the reversed arrays, and return that number.

```javascript
return leftArr.length + rightArr.length - leftRev.reduce((acc, _, i) => acc + (leftArr[i] !== leftRev[i]), 0) - rightRev.reduce((acc, _, i) => acc + (rightArr[i] !== rightRev[i]), 0);
```

The `reduce` method is used to count the number of differences between the original array and the reversed arrays. The `acc` parameter is used to keep track of the count of differences, and the `
