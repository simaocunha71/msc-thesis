To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Create a hash map to store the frequency of each element in the array.
2. Initialize a variable `count` to 0, which will keep track of the number of elements that need to be changed to make the array palindromic.
3. Iterate over the array and for each element, check if the element appears an odd number of times in the hash map. If so, increment the `count` by 1.
4. After iterating through all elements, return the `count`.

Here's the code for the solution:

```javascript
const smallestChange = (arr) => {
  const frequency = {};

  arr.forEach((num) => {
    frequency[num] = (frequency[num] || 0) + 1;
  });

  let count = 0;

  for (const num in frequency) {
    if (frequency[num] % 2 === 1) {
      count++;
    }
  }

  return count;
};
```

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array, as we iterate over the array once and perform a constant time operation for each element.

The space complexity is also O(n), as we use a hash map to store the frequency of each element in the array.

This solution has a clear and efficient approach to solving the problem, and it provides an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n).

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.

/*
  Given an array arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that
  need to be changed to make the array palindromic. A palindromic array is an array that
  is read the same backwards and forwards. In one change, you can change one element to any other element.

  For example:
  smallestChange([1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6]) == 4
  smallestChange([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]) == 1
  smallestChange([1, 2, 3
