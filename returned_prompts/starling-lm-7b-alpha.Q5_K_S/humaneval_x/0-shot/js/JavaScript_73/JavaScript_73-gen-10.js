To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array palindromic.

We can start by checking if the length of the array is even or odd. If it's even, we can divide the array into two halves and check if the elements in each half are the same. If they are not the same, we need to count the number of elements that are different and add it to the result. If the length of the array is odd, we need to find the middle element and check if it's the same as the element at the end of the array. If they are not the same, we need to count the number of elements that are different and add it to the result.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Check if the length of the array is even or odd. If it's even, divide the array into two halves. If it's odd, find the middle element.
2. Compare the elements in each half of the array (or the middle element) and count the number of elements that are different.
3. Add the count from step 2 to the result.
4. If the length of the array is odd, compare the middle element with the last element and add the count to the result.
5. Return the result.

In the given example, for the array [1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 9, 6], the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array palindromic is 4. This is because we need to change the elements at the beginning and end of the array to make it palindromic.

For the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2], the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array palindromic is 1. This is because we only need to change one element in the middle to make it palindromic.

For the array [1, 2, 3, 2, 1], the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array palindromic is 0. This is because all the elements in the array are already palindromic.

Overall, the solution involves comparing elements in the
