To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Sort the array in ascending order.
2. Initialize a pointer at the middle of the array.
3. Initialize a counter to store the number of elements that need to be changed.
4. Compare each pair of elements from both ends of the array. If the elements are not equal, increment the counter and move the pointers toward the center.
5. Return the counter value as the result.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

Step 1: Sort the array in ascending order.
To find the minimum number of elements that need to be changed, we need to match the elements from both ends of the array. Sorting the array in ascending order will allow us to easily compare each pair of elements.

Step 2: Initialize a pointer at the middle of the array.
We need to find the middle index of the array to compare the elements from both ends. If the array has an odd length, the middle index will be the floor of the array length divided by 2. If the array has an even length, the middle index will be the average of the two indices at the end of the array.

Step 3: Initialize a counter to store the number of elements that need to be changed.
We need to keep track of the number of elements that need to be changed to make the array palindromic. Initialize a counter variable to 0.

Step 4: Compare each pair of elements from both ends of the array.
Starting from the middle index, compare each pair of elements from both ends of the array. If the elements are not equal, increment the counter and move the pointers toward the center.

Step 5: Return the counter value as the result.
After comparing all the elements, the counter variable will hold the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array palindromic. Return this value as the result.

Here's an example implementation of the solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
const smallestChange = (arr) => {
  const sortedArr = arr.slice().sort((a, b) => a - b);
  const mid = Math.floor(sortedArr.length / 2);
  let counter = 0;

  for (let i = 0;
