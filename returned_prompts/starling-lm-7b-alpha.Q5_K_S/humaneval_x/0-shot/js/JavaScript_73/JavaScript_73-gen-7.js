To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array palindromic. Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. Sort the given array in ascending order. This will help us identify the unique elements in the array.

2. Create a hashmap (or dictionary) to keep track of the frequency of each element in the sorted array.

3. Iterate through the sorted array and for each element, check if its frequency is odd. If it is, increment a counter variable. This counter variable will keep track of the number of odd-frequency elements.

4. Once the iteration is complete, return the counter variable, which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array palindromic.

Here's the code that implements this solution:

```javascript
const smallestChange = (arr) => {
  // Step 1: Sort the given array in ascending order
  const sortedArr = arr.slice().sort((a, b) => a - b);

  // Step 2: Create a hashmap to keep track of the frequency of each element in the sorted array
  const freq = {};
  for (let i = 0; i < sortedArr.length; i++) {
    if (!freq[sortedArr[i]]) {
      freq[sortedArr[i]] = 0;
    }
    freq[sortedArr[i]]++;
  }

  // Step 3: Iterate through the sorted array and increment the counter if the frequency of the element is odd
  let counter = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < sortedArr.length; i++) {
    if (freq[sortedArr[i]] % 2 === 1) {
      counter++;
    }
  }

  // Step 4: Return the counter, which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array palindromic
  return counter;
};
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting step, and a space complexity of O(n) due to the hashmap.

For example, if we call `smallestChange([1,2
