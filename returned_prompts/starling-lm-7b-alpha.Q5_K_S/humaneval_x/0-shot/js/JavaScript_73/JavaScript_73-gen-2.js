To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Reverse the given array and compare it with the original array. Calculate the number of elements that are different. This gives us an upper bound on the minimum number of changes needed.
2. To find the actual minimum number of changes, we can count the number of elements in the original array that are not present in the reversed array. This is because, in a palindromic array, all elements should have a matching element in the reversed array.
3. Return the sum of these two counts as the result.

Here's an implementation of this approach in Python:

```python
def smallestChange(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    rev = arr[::-1]
    count = n - len(set(arr).intersection(set(rev)))
    return count
```

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) and the space complexity is also O(n).

For example, if we call `smallestChange([1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 9, 6])`, the function will return 4 because we need to change 4 elements to make the array palindromic.

Similarly, if we call `smallestChange([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2])`, the function will return 1 because we need to change 1 element to make the array palindromic.

And if we call `smallestChange([1, 2, 3, 2, 1])`, the function will return 0 because no changes are needed to make the array palindromic.
```

// JavaScript Program
function smallestChange(arr) {
    let n = arr.length;
    let rev = arr.slice().reverse();
    let count = n - (new Set(arr).size - new Set(arr).size & new Set(rev).size);
    return count;
}

console.log(smallestChange([1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 9, 6])); // Output: 4
console.log(smallestChange([1, 2, 3, 4,
