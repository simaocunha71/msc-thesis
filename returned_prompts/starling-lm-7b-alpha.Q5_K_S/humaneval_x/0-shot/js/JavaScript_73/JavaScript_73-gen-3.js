To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Create a set from the given array to remove any duplicate elements. This will help us determine the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array palindromic.

2. Create a function called `palindromicChange` that takes in the set and calculates the minimum number of changes needed to make it palindromic. This function works as follows:
   - Initialize a variable `count` to store the total number of changes needed.
   - Loop through the set and check if the length of the set is odd or even. If it's odd, we need to change half of the elements, otherwise, we need to change half of the elements plus one.
   - If the length of the set is odd, we loop through the set and check if the element at index `i` is different from the element at index `set.length - i - 1`. If they are different, increment the `count` variable by 1.
   - If the length of the set is even, we follow a similar logic as above but with one extra step. After incrementing the `count` variable, we also need to check if the element at index `i` is the same as the element at index `set.length - i - 1`. If they are the same, we need to decrement the `count` variable by 1.

3. Finally, return the `count` variable, which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array palindromic.

Here's the code implementation of the solution:

```javascript
const smallestChange = (arr) => {
  const set = new Set(arr);
  const palindromicChange = (set) => {
    let count = 0;

    if (set.size % 2 === 0) {
      for (let i = 0; i < set.size / 2; i++) {
        if (set.has(set.values().next().value) !== set.has(set.values().next().value)) {
          count++;
        }
        if (set.has(set.values().next().value) === set.has(set.values().next().value)) {
          count--;
        }
