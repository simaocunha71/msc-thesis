To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Make sure the length of xs is even and the largest non-zero coefficient is negative. If not, we can modify the coefficients as follows:
   - If the length of xs is odd, add a 0 coefficient at the end of xs.
   - If the largest non-zero coefficient is positive, multiply all coefficients by -1.

2. Calculate the resultant (the discriminant) of the polynomial. The resultant is a value that can be used to determine if the polynomial has real roots. It is calculated as follows:
   - For a polynomial of degree n, the resultant is the determinant of a matrix of size n x n, where each row represents the coefficients of the polynomial and each column represents the powers of x.
   - In this case, since we only have even-degree polynomials, we can simplify the calculation as follows:
     - For a polynomial of degree 2, the resultant is 4 times the square of the leading coefficient minus 4 times the square of the constant term.
     - For a polynomial of degree 4, the resultant is 16 times the square of the leading coefficient minus 16 times the square of the constant term.

3. Check if the resultant is 0. If it is, the polynomial has no real roots. If it is not 0, the polynomial has at least one real root.

4. If the polynomial has at least one real root, we can use the quadratic formula to find it. The quadratic formula is as follows:
   - For a polynomial of degree 2, the root is given by -b / 2a, where a is the coefficient of x^2 and b is the coefficient of x.
   - For a polynomial of degree 4, the roots are given by the following formulas:
     - x = (-b Â± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a, where a is the coefficient of x^4, b is the coefficient of x^2, and c is the coefficient of x.

5. If the polynomial has multiple real roots, the quadratic formula will give us all of them. If the polynomial has no real roots, the quadratic formula will not give us any solutions.
