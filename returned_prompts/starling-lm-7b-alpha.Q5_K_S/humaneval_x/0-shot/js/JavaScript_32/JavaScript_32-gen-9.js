To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Find the first non-zero coefficient, which is the coefficient of the highest degree term in the polynomial. For example, in the polynomial 6x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x - 1, the first non-zero coefficient is 6. 
2. If the degree of the polynomial is odd, then the polynomial has at least one real root, which can be found using the Babylonian method. 
3. If the degree of the polynomial is even, then the polynomial has at least two real roots, one of which is 0. 
4. To find the root, you can use the Babylonian method. The Babylonian method is an iterative algorithm that can be used to find the square root of a number. 
5. To find the square root of a number using the Babylonian method, you can follow these steps:
   - Start with an initial guess. For example, if you are finding the square root of 2, you can start with an initial guess of 1. 
   - Multiply the initial guess by itself. For example, 1 * 1 = 1. 
   - Subtract the initial guess from the number you are trying to find the square root of. For example, 2 - 1 = 1. 
   - Divide the result by 2. For example, 1 / 2 = 0.5. 
   - Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the result converges to the correct value. 
6. Once the Babylonian method has converged, you can use the result as the initial guess for the next iteration of the Babylonian method. 
7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 until the result converges to the correct value. 
8. Once the Babylonian method has converged, you can return the result as the root of the polynomial. 
9. If the degree of the polynomial is odd, you can use the same Babylonian method to find the root of the polynomial. 
10. Repeat steps 5 and 6 until the result converges to the correct value. 
11. Once the Babylonian method has converged, you can return the result as the root of the polynomial.
