To solve the equation, we can use Newton's method.

We can define a function f(x) as follows:

f(x) = a_n * x^n + a_(n-1) * x^(n-1) + ... + a_1 * x + a_0

Given the function, we can define a new function f'(x) as its derivative:

f'(x) = n * a_n * x^(n-1) + (n-1) * a_(n-1) * x^(n-2) + ... + a_1

The derivative is the slope of the tangent line to the function at the point x.
To find the zero points of f(x), we can start with a guess x0 and find a sequence of x's as follows:

x_(i+1) = x_i - f(x_i) / f'(x_i)

As the sequence converges, the zero point of f(x) can be found.

In this problem, we need to find the zero point of f(x) = 0. We can rewrite f(x) as follows:

f(x) = a_n * x^n + a_(n-1) * x^(n-1) + ... + a_1 * x + a_0 = 0

Let's denote f(x) as P(x). Then, we need to find the zero point of P(x).

The first step is to calculate the derivative of P(x):

P'(x) = n * a_n * x^(n-1) + (n-1) * a_(n-1) * x^(n-2) + ... + a_1

The second step is to define a function f(x) as follows:

f(x) = P(x) / P'(x)

The third step is to find the zero point of f(x):

f(x) = 0

The fourth step is to use Newton's method to find the zero point of f(x):

x_(i+1) = x_i - f(x_i) / f'(x_i)

We can use the
