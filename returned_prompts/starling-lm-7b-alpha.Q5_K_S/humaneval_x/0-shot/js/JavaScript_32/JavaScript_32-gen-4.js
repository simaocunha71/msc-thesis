To solve the polynomial equation of the form:

```
x^n * c_n + x^(n-1) * c_(n-1) + ... + x * c_1 + c_0 = 0
```

We can follow the following steps:

1. **Divide each coefficient by the largest non-zero coefficient.** This is to make the leading coefficient equal to 1. For example, if the coefficients are `[6, 3, 2]`, after dividing by 6, we will have `[1, 1/6, 1/3]`.

2. **Substitute `x = -1` into the polynomial.** This will give us a value, which we'll denote as `r`. In our example, if `x = -1`, the polynomial evaluates to `r = 1/6 - 1/3 + 1 = -1/6`.

3. **If `r` is equal to 0, then `x = -1` is a root of the polynomial, and we can stop here.** In our example, `r` is not equal to 0, so we need to continue.

4. **Now, we need to find the value of `x` that makes the polynomial equal to 0. We can use Newton's method for this. Here's the formula for Newton's method:**

```
x_(n+1) = x_n - f(x_n) / f'(x_n)
```

5. **In our case, `f(x)` is the polynomial we are evaluating, and `f'(x)` is the derivative of the polynomial. Here's how you can calculate the derivative of a polynomial:**

```python
def derivative(coeffs):
    return [i * coeffs[i] for i in range(len(coeffs))]
```

6. **We can now implement Newton's method in Python:**

```python
def newton_raphson(xs, r):
    x = 0
    for _ in range(100):
        x_new = x - poly(xs, x) / derivative(xs)(x)
        if abs(x_new - x) <
