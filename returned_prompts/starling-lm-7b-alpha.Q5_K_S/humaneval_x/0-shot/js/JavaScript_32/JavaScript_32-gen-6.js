I: list xs -> findZero(xs)

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Ensure that the number of coefficients is even, otherwise return an error.
2. Check if all coefficients are zero, if so return an error.
3. Find the largest nonzero coefficient of the polynomial. If all coefficients are negative, then the result should be multiplied by -1.
4. Approximate the zero point by using Newton-Raphson method.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

Step 1: Ensure that the number of coefficients is even:
- If the length of the xs array is odd, return an error.

Step 2: Check if all coefficients are zero:
- If all coefficients in the xs array are zero, return an error.

Step 3: Find the largest nonzero coefficient of the polynomial:
- Initialize the largest nonzero coefficient as the first coefficient of the xs array.
- Iterate through the xs array and update the largest nonzero coefficient if a larger nonzero coefficient is found.
- If all coefficients are negative, set the sign of the result to be -1.

Step 4: Approximate the zero point by using Newton-Raphson method:
- Initialize the initial guess as 0.
- Iterate until the absolute difference between the current guess and the previous guess is less than a specified tolerance (e.g., 1e-6).
- At each iteration, use the Newton-Raphson method to approximate the zero point.
- Return the final result as the zero point of the polynomial.

Note: The Newton-Raphson method is used to approximate the zero point of a function. It is an iterative method that uses the derivative of the function to update the guess at each iteration. The derivative of a polynomial is a polynomial of one degree lower, so we can use the same method to find the zero point of the derivative.

Overall, this solution ensures that the number of coefficients is even, checks if all coefficients are zero, finds the largest nonzero coefficient, and uses the Newton-Raphson method to approximate the zero point of the polynomial.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^3), where n is the number of coefficients in the xs array. This is because each iteration
