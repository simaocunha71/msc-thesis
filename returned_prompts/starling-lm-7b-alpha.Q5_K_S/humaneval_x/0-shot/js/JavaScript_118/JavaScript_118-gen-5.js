In this code, we start by defining an array called `vowel`, which contains all the vowel characters. Then, we initialize an empty string called `result`.

We use a `for` loop to iterate through each character of the `word` starting from the second character (index 1) until the second to last character (index length - 1). This is because we want to find the vowel that stands between two consonants from the right side of the word.

Inside the loop, we check if the current character is a vowel (by checking if it exists in the `vowel` array) and if the previous character and the next character are both consonants (represented by "b" in the code). If both conditions are met, we assign the current character to the `result` variable and break out of the loop.

Finally, we return the `result` which is the closest vowel that stands between two consonants from the right side of the word. If no such vowel is found, the `result` will remain empty and an empty string will be returned.

To test the code, we use the `getClosestVowel` function with different input words and log the results to the console using `console.log`.

The expected output for the provided test cases are:
- "yogurt" => "u"
- "FULL" => "U"
- "quick" => ""
- "ab" => ""
