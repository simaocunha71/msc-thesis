function wordsString(s) {
  return s.split(/[ ,]+/);
}

// Alternatively, you can use the following function which uses the split method with a regular expression:

function wordsString(s) {
  return s.split(/[\s,]+/);
}

/*
  You can use the split method in JavaScript to split a string into an array of substrings. The split method takes a separator as an argument and returns an array of substrings. In the given problem, you are given a string of words separated by commas or spaces, and you need to split the string into words and return an array of the words.

  To split the string into words, you can use the split method with the regular expression /[ ,]+/ as the separator. This regular expression matches one or more occurrences of a comma or a space. The split method splits the string at each occurrence of the regular expression and returns an array of the substrings.

  In the first solution, the regular expression /[ ,]+/ is used as the separator. This regular expression matches one or more occurrences of a comma or a space.

  In the second solution, the regular expression /[\s,]+/ is used as the separator. This regular expression matches one or more occurrences of a whitespace character (including spaces, tabs, and line breaks) or a comma.

  Both solutions will return an array of the words in the given string, with each word being a separate element in the array.
