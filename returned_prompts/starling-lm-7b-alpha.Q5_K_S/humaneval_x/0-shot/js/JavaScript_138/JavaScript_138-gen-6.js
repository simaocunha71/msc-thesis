Let's solve the above problem step by step.

Explanation:
To determine whether a number can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers, we can check whether the number can be expressed as a sum of consecutive even integers. Since the sum of 4 consecutive even integers is always divisible by 4, we can directly check if the number is divisible by 4.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Create a function called isEqualToSumEven that takes a number n as an input.
2. Check whether the number n is divisible by 4 using the modulo operator (%). If the remainder of n divided by 4 is 0, then the number is divisible by 4 and can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers.
3. If the condition in step 2 is true, return true. Otherwise, return false.
4. Test the function with different cases to verify its correctness.

The time complexity of this solution is O(1) because we are only performing a single modulo operation. The space complexity is also O(1) as we are not using any extra space that scales with the input size.

Here's the implementation of the solution in Python:

def isEqualToSumEven(n):
  if n % 4 == 0:
    return True
  return False

By following this approach, we can efficiently determine whether a number can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers.
