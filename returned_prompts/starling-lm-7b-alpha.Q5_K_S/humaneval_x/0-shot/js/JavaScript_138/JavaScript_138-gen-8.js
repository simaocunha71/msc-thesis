To determine whether the given number n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers, we can use a backtracking algorithm to try all possible combinations of even numbers until we find a valid combination that adds up to n.

Here is a step-by-step guide to implementing the backtracking algorithm:

1. Create an empty array called "evens" to store the even numbers that will be used in the combination.
2. Define a function called "backtrack" that takes the current sum and the index of the current even number as parameters. This function will be responsible for checking if the current sum is equal to n and for backtracking if the sum exceeds n.
3. Inside the "backtrack" function, check if the current sum is equal to n. If it is, return true, as we have found a valid combination. If not, continue to the next step.
4. Check if the index is equal to the length of the "evens" array. If it is, backtrack and try a different combination, as we have reached the end of the array without finding a valid combination. If not, continue to the next step.
5. Check if the current even number (evens[index]) is greater than n. If it is, backtrack and try a different combination, as adding this even number will exceed the maximum sum allowed. If not, continue to the next step.
6. Add the current even number to the current sum.
7. Increment the index to move to the next even number in the "evens" array.
8. Recursively call the "backtrack" function with the updated sum and index.
9. If the "backtrack" function returns true, return true, as we have found a valid combination. If not, return false, as we have exhausted all possible combinations and could not find a valid one.
10. In the main "isEqualToSumEven" function, initialize the "evens" array with even numbers from 2 to n, inclusive. Then, call the "backtrack" function with an initial sum of 0 and an index of 0. If the "backtrack" function returns true, return true, as we have found a valid combination. If not, return false, as there is no valid combination that adds up to n.

Here's an example implementation of the solution in JavaScript:
