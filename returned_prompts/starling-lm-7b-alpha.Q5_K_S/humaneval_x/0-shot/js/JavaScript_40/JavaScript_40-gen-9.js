To solve this problem, we'll use a nested loop to iterate over the array and check for three distinct elements that sum to zero. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize an empty set called seen to keep track of the elements we have seen.
2. Iterate over the array using a for loop. For each element at index i, check if the absolute value of the element minus the target (0) is in the seen set. If it is, it means we have found three distinct elements that sum to zero, so return true. If not, add the element to the seen set and continue with the next iteration.
3. If the loop finishes without finding a valid triplet, return false.

Here's the code implementation of the solution:

```javascript
const triplesSumToZero = (l) => {
  const seen = new Set();

  for (let i = 0; i < l.length; i++) {
    const target = -l[i];
    if (seen.has(target)) {
      return true;
    }
    seen.add(l[i]);
  }

  return false;
};
```

This implementation has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array, as we iterate over the array once. The space complexity is O(n) as well, as we use a set to store the elements we have seen.

You can test the solution with the provided test cases in the code comments to verify its correctness.

Ans:
The solution to the problem is as follows:

1. Define a function called `triplesSumToZero` that takes an array `l` as an argument.
2. Create an empty set called `seen` to keep track of the elements we have seen.
3. Use a for loop to iterate over the array. For each element at index `i`, check if the absolute value of the element minus the target (0) is in the `seen` set. If it is, return `true` as we have found three distinct elements that sum to zero. If not, add the element to the `seen` set and continue with the next iteration.
4. If the loop finishes without finding a valid triplet
