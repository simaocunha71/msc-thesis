To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Sort the input array in ascending order. This will help in identifying the elements that sum to zero. Sorting is an O(n log n) operation, where n is the number of elements in the array.
2. Create a hash map (or dictionary) to store the occurrence count of each element in the array. This will be used to check if three distinct elements can sum to zero. Creating the hash map is an O(n) operation.
3. Iterate through the sorted array and for each element, check if its negation is present in the hash map. If it is, then it means that the element and its negation can sum to zero. If the negation is not present in the hash map, check if the element and its negation can be formed by summing two other distinct elements from the hash map. If yes, return true; otherwise, continue with the next element. The time complexity of this step is O(n).
4. If no three distinct elements are found that sum to zero, return false.

Here's a Python implementation of the solution:

```python
def triplesSumToZero(l):
    l.sort()
    count_map = {}
    for num in l:
        if -num in count_map:
            return True
        if num in count_map:
            count_map[num] += 1
        else:
            count_map[num] = 1
    for i in range(len(l) - 2):
        if l[i] + l[i + 1] + l[i + 2] == 0:
            return True
    return False
```

The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to sorting and O(n) for creating the hash map and checking for three elements. The space complexity is also O(n) due to the hash map.
