One approach to solve this problem is to use a hashmap to keep track of all the sums that have been seen so far. For every element in the array, we add it to the hashmap, and if the sum of the current element with another two elements in the hashmap is zero, we return true. Otherwise, we return false.

Here's how you can implement this approach:

1. Create an empty hashmap called `seen`.
2. Iterate through the input array. For each element `el` in the array:
   - If `-el` is in the `seen` hashmap, return true, as we've found three distinct elements that sum to zero.
   - Otherwise, add `el` to the `seen` hashmap.
3. If we've iterated through the entire array and haven't found three elements that sum to zero, return false.

Here's the code for this approach:

```javascript
const triplesSumToZero = (l) => {
  const seen = {};

  for (let el of l) {
    if (-el in seen) {
      return true;
    }
    seen[el] = true;
  }
  return false;
};
```

This implementation has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array, as we only need to iterate through the array once. The space complexity is also O(n), as the `seen` hashmap could potentially have up to n elements.

Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.
