/*
Here is the logic behind the solution:

A right-angled triangle can be formed by three sides a, b, and c if the
square of one side is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides.

In mathematical terms, this can be expressed as:

a^2 + b^2 = c^2

So, if the above equation holds true for the given values of a, b, and c, then
these three sides can form a right-angled triangle.

Let's write a function that checks this condition.


*/

  return Math.pow(a, 2) + Math.pow(b, 2) === Math.pow(c, 2);
};

rightAngleTriangle(3, 4, 5) // true
rightAngleTriangle(1, 2, 3) // false
