To determine if a triangle with sides of length a, b, and c is a right triangle,
we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In other words, for a triangle to be a right triangle, the equation a² + b² = c² or b² + c² = a² or c² + a² = b² must be true.

In this case, the condition a² + b² = c² holds true. Therefore, the triangle is a right-angled triangle.

The function can be implemented as follows:

function rightAngleTriangle(a, b, c) {
  return (a * a + b * b) === c * c;
}

To test the function, you can use the following examples:

console.log(rightAngleTriangle(3, 4, 5)); // Returns true
console.log(rightAngleTriangle(1, 2, 3)); // Returns false

In the first example, a = 3, b = 4, and c = 5. The equation a² + b² = c² holds true, so the function returns true.

In the second example, a = 1, b = 2, and c = 3. The equation a² + b² = c² does not hold true, so the function returns false.
