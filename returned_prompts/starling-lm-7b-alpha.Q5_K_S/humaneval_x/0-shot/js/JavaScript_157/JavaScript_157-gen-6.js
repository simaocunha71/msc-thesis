// This problem can be solved using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. Here's how to do it:

// Check if a^2 + b^2 == c^2
// If so, return true, otherwise return false.

return (a ** 2 + b ** 2) === c ** 2
}

rightAngleTriangle(3, 4, 5);

/*
The time complexity of the above solution is O(1) since the operations performed are constant time.
The space complexity is also O(1) as the only additional space used is a single boolean variable.

This solution has a limitation: it only works when a and b are less than or equal to c. If that's not the case, you'll need to swap the values of a and b to ensure that a <= b <= c.

Also note that this solution only works if a, b and c are positive integers. If the input can be zero or negative, you'll need to add some additional checks.
