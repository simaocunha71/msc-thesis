/*
Explanation:
The area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula
area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))
where s is the semi-perimeter of the triangle, i.e., (a + b + c) / 2

In a right-angled triangle, the area is an integer.
This is because the square root of a number is an integer only if the number is a perfect square.

So, to determine if a triangle with sides a, b, and c is a right-angled triangle,
we calculate the area using the formula above and check if the area is an integer.
If it is, the triangle is a right-angled triangle; otherwise, it's not.

In the solution, the function rightAngleTriangle takes three arguments a, b, and c, representing the lengths of the sides of the triangle.

The function first calculates the semi-perimeter s of the triangle using the formula (a + b + c) / 2.
Then, it calculates the area of the triangle using the formula area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)).
Finally, the function returns true if the area is an integer (i.e., area === Math.floor(area)), and false otherwise.

The two test cases at the end of the code demonstrate the usage of the function.
In the first test case, rightAngleTriangle(3, 4, 5), the function returns true because the triangle with sides 3, 4, and 5 is a right-angled triangle.
In the second test case, rightAngleTriangle(1, 2, 3), the function returns false because the triangle with sides 1, 2, and 3 is not a right-angled triangle.
