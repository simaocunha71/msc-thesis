To determine if a triangle is right-angled, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

In other words, if we have a right-angled triangle with sides a, b, and c, where c is the length of the hypotenuse, then the equation c^2 = a^2 + b^2 must hold true.

Therefore, we can check if a, b, and c form a right-angled triangle by simply comparing whether c^2 is equal to a^2 + b^2. If it is, then the triangle is right-angled and we should return true; otherwise, it is not right-angled and we should return false.

Here's an example implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
const rightAngleTriangle = (a, b, c) => {
  return c*c === a*a + b*b;
};
```

This implementation takes three arguments: a, b, and c, representing the lengths of the three sides of the triangle. It then checks whether c^2 is equal to a^2 + b^2, and returns true if it is, and false otherwise.

You can use this function to determine if a given set of side lengths forms a right-angled triangle. For example, calling `rightAngleTriangle(3, 4, 5)` will return true, as the triangle with side lengths 3, 4, and 5 is indeed a right-angled triangle. On the other hand, calling `rightAngleTriangle(1, 2, 3)` will return false, as the triangle with side lengths 1, 2, and 3 is not a right-angled triangle.

In addition to the Pythagorean theorem, there are also other methods to determine if a triangle is right-angled. One such method is to check if the triangle is isosceles (i.e., two sides have the same length) and if the square of the length of the third side is less than the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. However, using the Pythagorean theorem is generally more
