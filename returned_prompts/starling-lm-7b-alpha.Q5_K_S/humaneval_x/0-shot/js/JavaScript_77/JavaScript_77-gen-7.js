  return Math.pow(a, 1/3) % 1 === 0;

};

/*
  This solution uses the pow function of the Math object in JavaScript to raise a to the power of 1/3.
  The modulus operator is used to remove the decimal part of the result. If the result is zero, then a is a cube of some integer number.
  Otherwise, a is not a cube of some integer number.
  The pow function returns the result of the exponentiation operation a to the power of b, where a is the base and b is the exponent.
  The modulus operator returns the remainder of the division of the left operand by the right operand.
  In this case, the left operand is the result of the pow function and the right operand is 1.
