The answer is : true

Explanation:
This problem is asking to create a function called `anyInt` that takes three numbers as parameters. The function should return `true` if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two, and all numbers are integers. The function should return `false` in any other cases.

To solve this problem, we can check if the sum of two numbers is equal to the third number. We can do this by using the modulo operator (`%`) to check if the third number is divisible by the sum of the other two. If it is, then we can return `true`. Otherwise, we can return `false`.

Here's an example of how to use the function:

```javascript
console.log(anyInt(5, 2, 7));  // true
console.log(anyInt(3, 2, 2));  // false
console.log(anyInt(3, -2, 1));  // true
console.log(anyInt(3.6, -2.2, 2));  // false
```

In the first example, the sum of 5 and 2 is 7, and 7 is equal to the third number 7. Therefore, the function returns `true`.

In the second example, the sum of 3 and 2 is 5, but 5 is not equal to the third number 2. Therefore, the function returns `false`.

In the third example, the sum of 3 and -2 is 1, and 1 is equal to the third number 1. Therefore, the function returns `true`.

In the fourth example, the sum of 3.6 and -2.2 is 1.4, but 1.4 is not equal to the third number 2. Therefore, the function returns `false`.

So, the function `anyInt` correctly checks if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two, and all numbers are integers.

The time complexity of this function is O(1) because it only performs a single modulo operation.

The space complexity is O(1) because it only uses a single variable to store the result of the modulo operation.

Overall, this function is a simple and efficient way to
