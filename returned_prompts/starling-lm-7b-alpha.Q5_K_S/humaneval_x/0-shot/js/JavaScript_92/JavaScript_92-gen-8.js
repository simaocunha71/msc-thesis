The goal of this question is to check if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two and all numbers are integers.
To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:

1. Check if all the numbers are integers.
2. Calculate the sum of any two numbers.
3. Check if any of the calculated sum is equal to the third number.
4. Return the result of the check.

Here is the Python code to implement the above steps:

```python
def anyInt(x, y, z):
    if not (isinstance(x, int) and isinstance(y, int) and isinstance(z, int)):
        return False
    return any(x == y + z or y == x + z or z == x + y)
```

This function first checks if all the input numbers are integers using the `isinstance()` function. If any of them is not an integer, it immediately returns False.

Then, it uses the `any()` function to check if any of the conditions `x == y + z or y == x + z or z == x + y` is true. The `any()` function returns True if at least one of the conditions is true. Otherwise, it returns False.

This function will return True if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two and all numbers are integers. Otherwise, it will return False.

For example, if you call `anyInt(5, 2, 7)`, it will return True because 2 is equal to the sum of 5 and 7.

On the other hand, if you call `anyInt(3, 2, 2)`, it will return False because none of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two.

Similarly, if you call `anyInt(3, -2, 1)`, it will return True because 1 is equal to the sum of 3 and -2.

Lastly, if you call `anyInt(3.6, -2.2, 2)`, it will return False because none of the numbers is an integer.

In summary, this function will return True if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two and all numbers are integers. Otherwise, it will return
