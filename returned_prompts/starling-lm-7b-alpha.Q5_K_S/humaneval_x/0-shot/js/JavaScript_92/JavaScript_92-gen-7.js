One of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two numbers, and all numbers are integers.

The function `anyInt` takes three parameters, `x`, `y`, and `z`. It uses a conditional (ternary) operator to check if either `x` is equal to the sum of `y` and `z`, or if `y` is equal to the sum of `x` and `z`, or if `z` is equal to the sum of `x` and `y`. If any of these conditions are true and all three numbers are integers, the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

Here are some examples of the function in action:

```javascript
console.log(anyInt(5, 2, 7));  // true
console.log(anyInt(3, 2, 2));  // false
console.log(anyInt(3, -2, 1)); // true
console.log(anyInt(3.6, -2.2, 2)); // false
```

The first example returns `true` because `5` is equal to the sum of `2` and `7`. The second example returns `false` because none of the numbers are equal to the sum of the other two. The third example returns `true` because `1` is equal to the sum of `3` and `-2`. The fourth example returns `false` because `3.6` is not an integer.

Overall, the function correctly determines whether one of the input numbers is equal to the sum of the other two, and whether all numbers are integers.

Here are some additional test cases to validate the function's correctness:

```javascript
console.log(anyInt(0, 0, 0)); // true
console.log(anyInt(1, 2, 3)); // true
console.log(anyInt(1.5, 2.5, 4)); // false
console.log(anyInt(-1, 2, 3)); // true
console.log(anyInt(1, 2, 3.5)); // false
```

These test cases cover a range of scenarios, including all three numbers being zero, all three numbers being positive integers, one of the numbers being
