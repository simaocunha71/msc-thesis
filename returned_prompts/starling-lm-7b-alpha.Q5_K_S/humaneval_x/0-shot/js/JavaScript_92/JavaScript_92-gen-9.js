To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Check if all three parameters passed to the `anyInt` function are integers. If any of them are not integers, we can immediately return `false`.
2. Check if any of the three numbers is equal to the sum of the other two. If yes, return `true`. If not, return `false`.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

- The `typeof` operator is used to check the data type of the parameters. If any of the parameters is not a number, the function will return `false` immediately.
- The `Math.floor()` function is used to round down the decimal numbers to the nearest integer.
- The `===` operator is used to compare if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two. If the condition is satisfied, the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

By following these steps, the `anyInt` function will correctly determine if one of the three numbers is equal to the sum of the other two, while ensuring that all numbers are integers.

The provided example tests the `anyInt` function with various inputs and outputs the result.

In the example, `anyInt(5, 2, 7)` returns `true` because 5 is equal to the sum of 2 and 7, which are both integers.

`anyInt(3, 2, 2)` returns `false` because none of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two.

`anyInt(3, -2, 1)` returns `true` because 1 is equal to the sum of 3 and -2, which are both integers.

`anyInt(3
