One of the ways to solve this problem is to use conditional statements and mathematical operations. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Define the function `anyInt` that takes three parameters `x`, `y`, and `z`.
2. Inside the function, use a conditional statement (`if`) to check if the sum of `y` and `z` is equal to `x` and if all three numbers are integers.
3. If the condition is true, return `true`.
4. If the condition is false or any of the numbers are not integers, return `false`.

Here's the code that implements the solution:

```javascript
const anyInt = (x, y, z) => {
  if (typeof x === 'number' && typeof y === 'number' && typeof z === 'number' && Number.isInteger(x) && Number.isInteger(y) && Number.isInteger(z) && (x === y + z)) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
};
```

You can now use the `anyInt` function to check if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two, and all numbers are integers.

For example:
- `anyInt(5, 2, 7)` will return `true` because 5 is equal to 2 + 7 and all three numbers are integers.
- `anyInt(3, 2, 2)` will return `false` because 3 is not equal to 2 + 2, even though all three numbers are integers.
- `anyInt(3, -2, 1)` will return `true` because 3 is equal to -2 + 1 and all three numbers are integers.
- `anyInt(3.6, -2.2, 2)` will return `false` because 3.6 is not an integer, and the condition for all numbers being integers is not met.

I hope this helps you understand the solution to the problem! Let me know if you have any more questions.
