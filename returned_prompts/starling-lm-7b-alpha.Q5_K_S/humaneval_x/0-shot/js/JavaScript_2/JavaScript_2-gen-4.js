/*
  The problem can be solved by using the modulo operator (%), which returns the remainder after the division of two numbers. In this case, the number divided by 1, which will always be the decimals part.

  The modulo operator is used to get the remainder of the division of the given number by 1, which is the decimal part. This is because the modulo operation calculates the remainder when one number is divided by another. In this case, the divisor is 1, so the result will always be the decimal part of the number.

  The modulo operation is performed by writing the number followed by the modulo operator (%), and then the divisor. In this case, the number is the given number, and the divisor is 1. The result of the modulo operation is the decimal part of the number.

  The modulo operation is a built-in operation in many programming languages, including JavaScript. It is used to find the remainder of the division of two numbers, and in this case, it is used to find the decimal part of a number.

  The modulo operation is used in this solution because it is a simple and efficient way to find the decimal part of a number. It is a built-in operation in many programming languages, so it does not require any additional code or libraries to implement.
