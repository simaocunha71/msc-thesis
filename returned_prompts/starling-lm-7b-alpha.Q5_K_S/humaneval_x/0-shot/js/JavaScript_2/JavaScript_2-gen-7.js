/* The Math.floor() method returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number.

In this problem, we can use this method to get the largest integer part of the number, and then subtract
this integer part from the given number to get the decimals part. */

/* Here is a test case to verify the solution:

>>> truncateNumber(3.5)
0.5

This means that the decimal part of the number 3.5 is 0.5. */
