To flip lowercase characters to uppercase and uppercase characters to lowercase, you can use the `toLowerCase()` and `toUpperCase()` string methods. Here's how you can implement the `flipCase` function:

```javascript
const flipCase = (string) => {
  return string.toLowerCase().toUpperCase();
};
```

When you call `flipCase('Hello')`, it will return `'hELLO'`.

This solution takes the given string and first converts all the characters to lowercase using the `toLowerCase()` method. Then, it converts all the lowercase characters to uppercase using the `toUpperCase()` method.

The `toLowerCase()` method is a built-in JavaScript method that converts all uppercase characters in a string to lowercase. The `toUpperCase()` method is also a built-in JavaScript method that converts all lowercase characters in a string to uppercase.

By chaining these two methods together, we can easily flip lowercase characters to uppercase and uppercase characters to lowercase.

It's important to note that these methods only affect the characters within the string itself and do not modify the original string. Instead, they return a new string with the characters flipped.

Here are a few more examples to demonstrate the behavior of the `flipCase` function:

- `flipCase('world')` returns `'WORLD'`
- `flipCase('StackOverflow')` returns `'STACKOVERFLOW'`
- `flipCase('123')` returns `'123'` (since numbers are not affected)
- `flipCase('')` returns an empty string (since there are no characters to flip)

Remember, the `flipCase` function only flips lowercase and uppercase characters, and it does not modify any other types of characters, such as numbers or special characters.
