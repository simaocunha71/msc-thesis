To flip the case of characters in a string, we can use the `toUpperCase()` and `toLocaleLowerCase()` methods in JavaScript. Here's how you can implement the `flipCase` function:

```javascript
const flipCase = (string) => {
  return string.toLowerCase().toUpperCase();
};
```

In this code, the `toLowerCase()` method is used to convert all the uppercase characters in the string to lowercase. Then, the `toUpperCase()` method is used to convert all the lowercase characters in the string to uppercase. By chaining these two methods together, we achieve the desired result of flipping the case of all characters in the string.

For example, if you call `flipCase('Hello')`, it will return `'hELLO'` as expected.

Note that this implementation is case-sensitive, meaning that uppercase letters are treated as uppercase and lowercase letters are treated as lowercase. If you want a case-insensitive version, you can use the `toLowerCase()` method alone, or if you want an uppercase version, you can use the `toUpperCase()` method alone.
