To flip the case of all characters in the string, you can use the `toLowerCase()` and `toUpperCase()` methods in JavaScript. Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
const flipCase = (string) => {
  return string.toLowerCase().toUpperCase();
};
```

In the above code, the `toLowerCase()` method converts all uppercase characters to lowercase and the `toUpperCase()` method converts all lowercase characters to uppercase. By chaining these two methods, we get a string with all characters flipped.

For example, if you call `flipCase('Hello')`, it will return `'hELLO'` as expected.

Note that this solution converts all characters to uppercase, regardless of their original case. If you want to keep non-alphabetical characters unchanged, you can modify the code like this:

```javascript
const flipCase = (string) => {
  return string.replace(/[a-z]/g, c => String.fromCharCode(c.charCodeAt(0) ^ 32));
};
```

In this version, the `replace()` method is used with a regular expression `/[a-z]/g` to target all lowercase letters. The `String.fromCharCode(c.charCodeAt(0) ^ 32)` expression flips the case of each lowercase letter by performing a bitwise XOR operation with 32 (`^ 32`), which is the ASCII value difference between uppercase and lowercase letters.

For instance, if you call `flipCase('Hello1')`, it will return `'hELLO1'` as desired.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.
