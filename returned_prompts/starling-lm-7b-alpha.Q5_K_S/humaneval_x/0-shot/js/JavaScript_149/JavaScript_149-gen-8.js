To solve this problem, you need to sort the list by the length of the strings and alphabetically.

Here are the steps to follow:

1. Sort the list by the length of the strings. This can be done using the `sort` method in JavaScript. You can use a custom comparator function that compares the lengths of two strings and returns a negative number if the first string is shorter, a positive number if the first string is longer, and 0 if the strings have the same length.

2. If the lengths of two strings are the same, sort them alphabetically. This can be done by comparing the strings using the `localeCompare` method in JavaScript. This method returns a negative number if the first string is lexicographically smaller, a positive number if the first string is lexicographically larger, and 0 if the strings are equal.

3. Delete the strings with odd lengths from the list. You can use the `filter` method in JavaScript to create a new array that contains only the strings with even lengths. You can use the modulo operator (`%`) to check if a number is odd or even. If the length of a string is odd, the modulo of its length with 2 will be 1, and if the length is even, the modulo will be 0.

4. Return the resulting list. You can use the `return` keyword in JavaScript to return the sorted and filtered list.

Here is an example of how you can implement this solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
function list_sort(lst) {
