The solution is to check if the two strings are each balanced on their own. If both strings have balanced parentheses, then it is possible to concatenate them in some order to form a balanced string.

To check if a string is balanced, we can iterate through the string and maintain a counter of the number of open parentheses we have seen. If we encounter an open parenthesis, we increment the counter. If we encounter a close parenthesis, we decrement the counter. If the counter ever reaches zero, it means that we have an unmatched open parenthesis, and the string is not balanced. If the counter is still positive at the end of the string, it means that there are unmatched open parentheses, and the string is not balanced.

In the provided solution, the `match` function checks if a given string is balanced by iterating through the string and maintaining the counter. It returns `false` if the counter becomes negative at any point, or if the counter is not zero at the end of the string. Otherwise, it returns `true`.

The `matchParens` function takes in a list of two strings and checks if each string is balanced using the `match` function. If both strings are balanced, it returns `'Yes'`. Otherwise, it returns `'No'`.

For example, when `matchParens(['()(', ')'])` is called, the `match` function is called with the first string `'()('`. Since the counter becomes negative at index 3 (when encountering the second close parenthesis), the `match` function returns `false`. Therefore, `matchParens` returns `'No'`.
