To determine whether the object will fly, we need to check if it's balanced and if the sum of its elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight w.

First, we need to check if q is a palindromic list. We can do this by comparing the first and last elements of q, and then moving inward until we reach the middle of the array:

```
let isPalindrome = true;
for (let i = 0; i < q.length / 2; i++) {
  if (q[i] !== q[q.length - 1 - i]) {
    isPalindrome = false;
    break;
  }
}
```

Next, we need to calculate the sum of the elements in q and compare it to the maximum possible weight w. We can use the `reduce` method to sum up the elements of q and then compare the result to w:

```
let sum = q.reduce((a, b) => a + b);
```

Finally, we can check if q is balanced (i.e., a palindrome) and if the sum of its elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight w. If both conditions are met, we return true; otherwise, we return false:

```
return isPalindrome && sum <= w;
```

Putting it all together, the function looks like this:

```javascript
const willItFly = (q, w) => {
  let isPalindrome = true;
  for (let i = 0; i < q.length / 2; i++) {
    if (q[i] !== q[q.length - 1 - i]) {
      isPalindrome = false;
      break;
    }
  }
  let sum = q.reduce((a, b) => a + b);
  return isPalindrome && sum <= w;
};
```

This function will return true if the object q will fly, and false otherwise.

Here's the code in action:

```javascript
console.log(willItFly([1, 2], 5));  // false
console.log(willItFly([3,
