To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Check if the sum of the elements in the array is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight (w). If it's not, return false immediately.
2. Reverse the array and check if it's equal to the original array. If it's not, return false immediately.
3. If both conditions are met, return true.

Here's the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
const willItFly = (q, w) => {
  // Step 1: Check if the sum of the elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight (w).
  if (q.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0) > w) {
    return false;
  }

  // Step 2: Reverse the array and check if it's equal to the original array.
  const reversedQ = [...q].reverse();
  if (reversedQ.length !== q.length || !reversedQ.every((value, index) => value === q[index])) {
    return false;
  }

  // Step 3: If both conditions are met, return true.
  return true;
};
```

You can use this implementation to check if an object will fly based on the provided conditions.

Note: This implementation assumes that the input array (q) is non-empty and contains only numerical values.

Here are some examples of usage:

```javascript
console.log(willItFly([1, 2], 5));  // false
console.log(willItFly([3, 2, 3], 1));  // false
console.log(willItFly([3, 2, 3], 9));  // true
console.log(willItFly([3], 5));  // true
```

These examples demonstrate how the function works with different inputs and the expected output.

To summarize, the provided implementation checks if an object will fly by verifying if the sum of its elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight (w) and if the array is balanced (palindromic). It returns true if both conditions are met, and false otherwise.
