To determine if an object will fly, we need to check two conditions:

1. The object is a palindrome (it is a balanced list).
2. The sum of the object's elements is less than or equal to the maximum weight w.

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to determine if an object will fly:

1. Check if the object q is a palindrome:
   - Convert the object q to a string.
   - Reverse the string.
   - Check if the original string and the reversed string are the same. If they are the same, then the object is a palindrome.

2. Check if the sum of the object's elements is less than or equal to the maximum weight w:
   - Initialize a variable sum to 0.
   - Iterate through each element in the object q.
   - Add each element to the sum.
   - Check if the sum is less than or equal to the maximum weight w. If it is, then the object will fly.

Here's an example of how to implement the willItFly function:

```javascript
const willItFly = (q, w) => {
  // Step 1: Check if the object q is a palindrome
  const qString = q.toString();
  const reversedQString = qString.split('').reverse().join('');
  if (qString !== reversedQString) {
    return false;
  }

  // Step 2: Check if the sum of the object's elements is less than or equal to the maximum weight w
  let sum = 0;
  q.forEach(element => {
    sum += element;
  });

  return sum <= w;
};
```

Using this implementation of the willItFly function, you can determine if an object will fly by passing in the object and the maximum weight as arguments. The function will return true if the object will fly, and false otherwise.

For example, if you pass in the object [1, 2] and the maximum weight 5, the function will return false because the sum of the elements (1+2=3) is greater than the maximum weight.

Similarly, if you pass in the object [3,
