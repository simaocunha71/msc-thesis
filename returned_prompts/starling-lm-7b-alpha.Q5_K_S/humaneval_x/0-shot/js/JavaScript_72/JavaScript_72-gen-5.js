To determine whether the given object q will fly, we need to check two conditions:

1. If the object q is balanced (it is a palindromic list). We can determine this by checking if the first half of the list is equal to the second half of the list, in reverse order. In JavaScript, we can use the `slice` method to get the first half of the list and the `reverse` method to reverse the second half. Then, we can compare them using the `===` operator.

2. If the sum of the elements in the list is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight w. We can calculate the sum using the `reduce` method, which sums all the elements in the array. Then, we can compare it to the maximum possible weight using the `<=` operator.

Let's put all this together in a function:

```javascript
const willItFly = (q, w) => {
  // Check if the object q is balanced (it is a palindromic list)
  const isBalanced = q.slice(0, Math.floor(q.length / 2)).every((el, index) => el === q.slice(Math.floor(q.length / 2)).reverse()[index]);

  // Check if the sum of the elements in the list is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight w
  const sumOfElements = q.reduce((acc, cur) => acc + cur, 0);
  const isSumLessThanMax = sumOfElements <= w;

  // Return true if the object q will fly, and false otherwise
  return isBalanced && isSumLessThanMax;
};
```

Now you can use the `willItFly` function to determine whether the object will fly or not.

For example, if you call `willItFly([3, 2, 3], 9)`, it will return `true` because the sum of the elements (3 + 2 + 3 = 8) is less than the maximum possible weight (9), and the object is balanced.

Similarly, if you call `willItFly([1, 2], 5)`, it will return `false` because the sum of the elements (1 + 2 = 3) is more than the
