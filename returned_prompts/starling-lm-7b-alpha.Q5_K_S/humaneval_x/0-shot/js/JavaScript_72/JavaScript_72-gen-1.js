To solve this problem, we need to check if the object q is balanced (it is a palindrome) and if the sum of its elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight w.

To check if a list is palindrome, we can compare the first and last elements and continue doing so until we reach the middle of the list. If all the pairs of elements are equal, then the list is a palindrome.

To check if the sum of the elements in the list is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight, we can iterate through the list and add each element to a variable called sum. Then, we can compare sum to the maximum possible weight.

Here's the code that solves the problem:

```javascript
const isPalindrome = (list) => {
  let start = 0;
  let end = list.length - 1;

  while (start < end) {
    if (list[start] !== list[end]) {
      return false;
    }
    start++;
    end--;
  }
  return true;
};

const willItFly = (q, w) => {
  if (!isPalindrome(q)) {
    return false;
  }
  const sum = q.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);
  return sum <= w;
};
```

In the `willItFly` function, we first call the `isPalindrome` function to check if the list `q` is a palindrome. If it's not, we return `false` immediately. If it is, we calculate the sum of all the elements in the list using the `reduce` method and compare it to the maximum possible weight `w`. If the sum is less than or equal to `w`, we return `true`, otherwise we return `false`.

This solution ensures that the object `q` will fly if it is balanced and the sum of its elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight `w`.

Here are some test cases to verify the solution:

console.log(willItFly([1, 2], 5)); // false
console.log(willItFly([3, 2, 3], 1)); // false
