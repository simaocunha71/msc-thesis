To determine if an object will fly, we need to check if it is balanced and if the sum of its elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Check if the object `q` is a palindromic list: A list is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward. To check if a list is palindromic, we can reverse it and compare it with the original list. If they are the same, then the list is palindromic. If not, it is not.

2. Calculate the sum of the elements in `q`: To calculate the sum of the elements in a list, we can use the `reduce()` method. This method takes a callback function that is applied to each element of the list, and an initial value. The callback function adds the current element to the accumulator (which starts with the initial value) and returns the updated accumulator. The `reduce()` method returns the final value of the accumulator.

3. Check if the sum of the elements in `q` is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight `w`: This can be done using the `<=` operator. If the sum is less than or equal to `w`, then the condition is true. Otherwise, it is false.

4. Return the result of the checks: If the list is palindromic and the sum of its elements is less than or equal to `w`, then the object will fly and we return `true`. Otherwise, it will not fly and we return `false`.

Here's an example implementation of the `willItFly()` function:

```javascript
const willItFly = (q, w) => {
  // Step 1: Check if the list is palindromic
  const isPalindromic = q.length === q.reverse().length;

  // Step 2: Calculate the sum of the elements in q
  const sum = q.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue, 0);

  // Step 3: Check if the sum is less than or equal to w
  const isSumLessThanOrEqualToW = sum <= w;

  // Step 4: Return the result of the checks
  return isPalindrom
