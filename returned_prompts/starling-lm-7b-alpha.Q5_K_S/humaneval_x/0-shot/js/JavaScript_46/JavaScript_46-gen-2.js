To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. Initialize an array `fib4` of size `n+1` with all elements set to -1. This array will store the computed values of the Fib4 sequence.

2. Set the first three elements of the `fib4` array to 0, 0, and 2, respectively. These values are part of the base cases defined in the problem.

3. Starting from index 4 up to `n`, update the values of `fib4` by summing the previous four elements (`fib4[n-1]`, `fib4[n-2]`, `fib4[n-3]`, `fib4[n-4]`). This step follows the recursive definition of the Fib4 sequence.

4. Return the value at index `n` in the `fib4` array, which represents the `n`th element of the Fib4 sequence.

Here's the code implementation of the solution:

```python
def fib4(n):
    fib4 = [0 for _ in range(n + 1)]  # Step 1: Initialize the fib4 array
    fib4[0], fib4[1], fib4[2] = 0, 0, 2  # Step 2: Set the base cases

    for i in range(3, n + 1):  # Step 3: Update the fib4 array using the recursive definition
        fib4[i] = fib4[i-1] + fib4[i-2] + fib4[i-3] + fib4[i-4]

    return fib4[n]  # Step 4: Return the nth element of the fib4 sequence
```

You can test the function with the provided test cases:

```python
print(fib4(5))  # Output: 4
print(fib4(6))  # Output: 8
print(fib4(7))  # Output: 14
```

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) since we need to iterate through the `
