Here's one possible way to solve the problem:

const fib4 = (n) => {
  const fib = [0, 0, 2];
  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    fib[i] = fib[i - 1] + fib[i - 2] + fib[i - 3] + fib[i - 4];
  }
  return fib[n];
};

The key insight is that the Fib4 sequence repeats every 4 terms (0, 0, 2, 0).
So, to compute fib4(n), we first find the remainder of n divided by 4.  If the remainder is 0, 1, or 2, we can use the precomputed values in the fib array.  Otherwise, we can use the recurrence relation to find the value.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), and the space complexity is O(1).

This problem can also be solved using dynamic programming, but the above approach is more efficient.

In the above solution, we use a loop to calculate the Fib4 number sequence. We start with the first three terms, and then in each iteration, we add the previous four terms to get the next term. We store the result in an array, and return the result at index n. This approach has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1).
