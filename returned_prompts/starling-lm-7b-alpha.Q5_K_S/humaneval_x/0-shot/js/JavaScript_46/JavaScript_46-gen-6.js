The function can be efficiently solved using dynamic programming.

Here's the step-by-step logic:

1. Create an array to store the fib4 number sequence from 0 to n.
2. Initialize the first four elements of the array with 0, 0, 2, and 0 respectively.
3. Starting with fib4(4), calculate fib4(n) by adding the previous four values of the array.
4. Return the nth element of the array, which is the nth fib4 number.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def fib4(n):
    # Initialize the first four elements of the array
    a, b, c, d = [0, 0, 2, 0] * (n+1)

    # Start calculating fib4(n) from fib4(4)
    for i in range(4, n+1):
        a, b, c, d = b, c, d+b+a, a

    return c
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) because it only calculates the necessary elements of the sequence, rather than all of them.

This solution also has a space complexity of O(n) because it uses an array to store the sequence.

Note: This solution does not use recursion, as per the requirements of the problem.

function fib4(n) {
  let result = [0, 0, 2, 0];
  for (let i = 4; i <= n; i++) {
    result[i] = result[i-1] + result[i-2] + result[i-3] + result[i-4];
  }
  return result[n];
}

console.log(fib4(5)); // 4
console.log(fib4(6)); // 8
console.log(fib4(7)); // 14
