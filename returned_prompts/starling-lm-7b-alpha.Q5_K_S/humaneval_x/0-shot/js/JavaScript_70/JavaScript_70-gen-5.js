One approach is to use an array to keep track of the remaining elements to be sorted,
and to use two pointers, one for the minimum value and one for the maximum value.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. Create an empty array called `sorted` to store the sorted elements.
2. Create a copy of the input array called `remaining` to keep track of the elements that haven't been sorted yet.
3. Initialize two pointers, `minIndex` and `maxIndex`, to the start of the `remaining` array.
4. While the `minIndex` and `maxIndex` are within the bounds of the `remaining` array, perform the following steps:
   a. Find the index of the minimum value in the `remaining` array using the `minIndex` pointer. This can be done by iterating through the `remaining` array and comparing each element with the current minimum value.
   b. Find the index of the maximum value in the `remaining` array using the `maxIndex` pointer. This can be done by iterating through the `remaining` array and comparing each element with the current maximum value.
   c. Swap the elements at the `minIndex` and `maxIndex` positions in the `remaining` array.
   d. Increment the `minIndex` by 1 to move to the next minimum value.
   e. Decrement the `maxIndex` by 1 to move to the previous maximum value.
5. After the loop, iterate through the `remaining` array and add each element to the `sorted` array.
6. Return the `sorted` array as the result.

By following this approach, the code ensures that the minimum and maximum values are swapped in each iteration, resulting in a strange sorting order. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array, as it only requires a single pass through the array.

Here's an example of how the code can be implemented in JavaScript:

```javascript
const strangeSortList = (lst) => {
  let sorted = [];
  let remaining = [...lst];
  let minIndex = 0;
  let maxIndex = remaining.length - 1;
