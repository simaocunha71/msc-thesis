To solve this problem, we can use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets encountered. We will iterate through the brackets string and push an opening bracket onto the stack. If we encounter a closing bracket, we will check if the top of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket. If it is, we will remove it from the stack. If not, we will return false. After iterating through the entire string, if the stack is empty, it means that all opening brackets have a corresponding closing bracket, so we will return true. Otherwise, the stack will still contain some opening brackets, so we will return false.

Here's the code:

```javascript
function correctBracketing(brackets) {
  const stack = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < brackets.length; i++) {
    const char = brackets[i];
    if (char === '<') {
      stack.push(char);
    } else if (char === '>') {
      if (stack.length === 0) {
        return false;
      } else if (stack[stack.length - 1] === '<') {
        stack.pop();
      } else {
        return false;
      }
    } else {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return stack.length === 0;
}
```

This implementation has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the brackets string.
