To solve this problem we need to use two stacks. The first stack will hold the opening brackets "<" and the second stack will hold the closing brackets ">".

We will iterate through each character in the `brackets` string. If the character is an opening bracket "<", we will push it to the stack. If the character is a closing bracket ">", we will pop the top element from the stack and check if it matches the current character. If the two brackets do not match, we return false.

After iterating through all the characters in the `brackets` string, if there are any remaining opening brackets in the first stack, we return false. Otherwise, we return true.

Here's the code to solve the problem:

```
const correctBracketing = (brackets) => {
  const openingBrackets = [];
  const closingBrackets = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < brackets.length; i++) {
    const currentChar = brackets[i];

    if (currentChar === "<") {
      openingBrackets.push(currentChar);
    } else if (currentChar === ">") {
      if (openingBrackets.length === 0) {
        return false;
      }

      const topOpeningBracket = openingBrackets.pop();
      if (topOpeningBracket !== currentChar) {
        return false;
      }
    }
  }

  return openingBrackets.length === 0;
};
```

This implementation has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the `brackets` string, as we iterate through each character once. The space complexity is O(n) as well, since we use two stacks to store the brackets.

// Test cases:
console.log(correctBracketing("<"));  // false
console.log(correctBracketing("<>"));  // false
console.log(correctBracketing("<<><>>"));  // false
console.log(correctBracketing("><<>"));  // false
