Here's one way you could implement the `correctBracketing` function:

```javascript
const correctBracketing = (brackets) => {
  const stack = [];
  for (const char of brackets) {
    if (char === '<') {
      stack.push(char);
    } else if (char === '>') {
      if (stack.length === 0) return false;
      stack.pop();
    }
  }
  return stack.length === 0;
};
```

The `correctBracketing` function takes in a string, `brackets`, containing "<" and ">". It uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets that haven't yet been matched with a closing bracket.

The function then iterates over each character in the `brackets` string. If the character is an opening bracket "<", it is pushed onto the stack. If the character is a closing bracket ">", the function checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, that means there is no opening bracket to match the closing bracket, so the function immediately returns `false`. If the stack is not empty, the topmost character is popped from the stack, which means the opening and closing brackets have been successfully matched.

After iterating over all the characters in the `brackets` string, the function checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, that means all opening brackets have been matched with closing brackets, and the function returns `true`. If the stack is not empty, that means there are opening brackets that haven't been matched with closing brackets, and the function returns `false`.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the `brackets` string, because the function iterates over each character in the string once.

The space complexity is also O(n) because the function uses a stack to store opening brackets, and the maximum size of the stack is determined by the number of opening brackets in the `brackets` string.

In terms of readability and maintainability, this solution is straightforward and easy to understand. It uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets and matches them with closing brackets. The
