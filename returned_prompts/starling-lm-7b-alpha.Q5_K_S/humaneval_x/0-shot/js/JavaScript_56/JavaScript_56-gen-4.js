Here's a function that should solve the problem:

```javascript
const correctBracketing = (brackets) => {
  const openingBrackets = ["<"];
  const closingBrackets = [">"];
  let stack = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < brackets.length; i++) {
    if (brackets[i] === openingBrackets[0]) {
      stack.push(brackets[i]);
    } else if (brackets[i] === closingBrackets[0]) {
      if (stack.length && stack[stack.length - 1] === openingBrackets[0]) {
        stack.pop();
      } else {
        return false;
      }
    } else {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return stack.length === 0;
};
```

This function uses a stack to keep track of all opening brackets that don't have a closing bracket. It loops through the brackets, and if it encounters an opening bracket, it adds it to the stack. If it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is non-empty and if the top of the stack is an opening bracket. If both conditions are met, it pops the opening bracket from the stack. If either condition is not met, it returns false. If it loops through all the brackets and the stack is empty, it returns true, indicating that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

Explanation:
The function `correctBracketing` takes in a string of brackets as an argument. It initializes an array `openingBrackets` with the opening bracket "<", and an array `closingBrackets` with the closing bracket ">". It also initializes an empty array `stack` to keep track of all opening brackets that don't have a corresponding closing bracket.

The function then loops through each character in the `brackets` string using a for loop. If the character is an opening bracket ("<"), it pushes it onto the `stack`. If the character is a closing bracket (">"), it checks if the `stack` is non-empty and if the top of the
