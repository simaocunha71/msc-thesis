To solve this problem, we need to iterate over the string of brackets and keep track of the opening and closing brackets.

We can use an array to store the opening brackets, and another array to store the closing brackets.

The opening brackets array will store each opening bracket as it is encountered, and the closing brackets array will store each closing bracket as it is encountered.

We can then compare the lengths of the two arrays to determine if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. If the lengths are not equal, then not all opening brackets have a closing bracket, and we return false.

Here's the code to solve the problem:

```javascript
const correctBracketing = (brackets) => {
  const openingBrackets = [];
  const closingBrackets = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < brackets.length; i++) {
    const currentBracket = brackets[i];

    if (currentBracket === '<') {
      openingBrackets.push(currentBracket);
    } else if (currentBracket === '>') {
      if (openingBrackets.length === 0) {
        return false;
      }
      openingBrackets.pop();
      closingBrackets.push(currentBracket);
    } else {
      return false;
    }
  }

  return closingBrackets.length === 0;
};
```

This code will iterate over the brackets string and keep track of the opening and closing brackets. It will return true if all opening brackets have a closing bracket, and false otherwise.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

- We start by initializing two empty arrays, `openingBrackets` and `closingBrackets`, to store the opening and closing brackets, respectively.
- We then iterate over each character in the `brackets` string using a for loop.
- Inside the loop, we check if the current character is an opening bracket (`<`). If it is, we push it onto the `openingBrackets` array.
- If the current character is a
