Here's one way you could approach this problem:

1. Create an empty stack
2. Iterate over the brackets string
3. For each bracket in the string:
  - If the bracket is an opening bracket (i.e. "<") then push it onto the stack
  - If the bracket is a closing bracket (i.e. ">") then:
    - If the stack is empty then return false
    - If the top of the stack is not an opening bracket which matches the current closing bracket then return false
    - Otherwise, pop the opening bracket from the stack
4. If the stack is empty after processing all brackets, then return true, otherwise return false

Here's the JavaScript code to implement the above approach:

```javascript
const correctBracketing = (brackets) => {
  let stack = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < brackets.length; i++) {
    let currentBracket = brackets[i];

    if (currentBracket === '<') {
      stack.push(currentBracket);
    } else if (currentBracket === '>') {
      if (stack.length === 0) {
        return false;
      }

      let topBracket = stack[stack.length - 1];
      if (topBracket !== '<') {
        return false;
      }

      stack.pop();
    }
  }

  return stack.length === 0;
};
```

This implementation uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets that have not yet been matched with a closing bracket. It iterates over the input string, pushing opening brackets onto the stack and popping them off when a matching closing bracket is encountered.

At the end, if the stack is empty then all opening brackets have a corresponding closing bracket and the function returns true. Otherwise, there is at least one opening bracket that does not have a corresponding closing bracket, and the function returns false.

This implementation has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string, as it iterates over the string once. The space complexity is O(n) as well, since the stack can
