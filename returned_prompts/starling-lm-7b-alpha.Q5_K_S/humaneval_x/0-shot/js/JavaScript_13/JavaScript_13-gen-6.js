The code snippet defines a function named "greatestCommonDivisor" that takes two integers, "a" and "b", as arguments and returns their greatest common divisor. The function uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor.

In the Euclidean algorithm, if b is zero, then a is the greatest common divisor of a and b. Otherwise, the function recursively calls itself with the arguments b and the remainder of a divided by b. This process continues until b becomes zero, and the function returns a, which is the greatest common divisor of a and b.

The code snippet includes two test cases to demonstrate the functionality of the "greatestCommonDivisor" function. The first test case, `greatestCommonDivisor(3, 5)`, returns 1, as the greatest common divisor of 3 and 5 is 1. The second test case, `greatestCommonDivisor(25, 15)`, returns 5, as the greatest common divisor of 25 and 15 is 5.

Overall, the function uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate and return the greatest common divisor of two integers.

Here's the code:

```python
def greatestCommonDivisor(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return greatestCommonDivisor(b, a % b)

# Test cases
print(greatestCommonDivisor(3, 5))  # Output: 1
print(greatestCommonDivisor(25, 15))  # Output: 5
```

You can use the code snippet to calculate the greatest common divisor of any two integers using the "greatestCommonDivisor" function.
