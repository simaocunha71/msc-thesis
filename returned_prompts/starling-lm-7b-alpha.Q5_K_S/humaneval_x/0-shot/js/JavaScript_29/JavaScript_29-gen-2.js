const result = [];
for (let i = 0; i < strings.length; i++) {
  if (strings[i].startsWith(prefix)) {
    result.push(strings[i]);
  }
}
return result;

Explanation:
The function filterByPrefix takes in two parameters: an array of strings called strings, and a string called prefix. It initializes an empty array called result.

It then iterates over the strings array using a for loop. For each string, it checks if the string starts with the given prefix using the startsWith method. If it does, it pushes the string to the result array using the push method.

Finally, it returns the result array, which contains only the strings that start with the given prefix.

Example usage:
console.log(filterByPrefix([], 'a')); // Output: []
console.log(filterByPrefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a')); // Output: ['abc', 'array']


In the given code, the filterByPrefix function uses a for loop to iterate over the input array of strings. It checks if each string starts with the given prefix using the startsWith method. If the condition is true, the string is added to the result array using the push method. Finally, the result array is returned, containing only the strings that start with the given prefix.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of strings in the input array. This is because the function iterates over the entire array once, performing a constant time operation (startsWith) for each string.

The space complexity of this solution is O(k), where k is the number of strings in the result array. This is because the result array can potentially grow to the same size as the input array, depending on the number of strings that start with the given prefix.

Overall, this solution provides a straightforward and efficient way to filter a list of strings based on a given prefix.
