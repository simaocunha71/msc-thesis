Here's one possible solution using the `filter()` method:
```javascript
const filterByPrefix = (strings, prefix) => {
  return strings.filter((string) => string.startsWith(prefix));
};
```
This function takes in a list of strings (`strings`) and a prefix to filter by. It uses the `filter()` method on the `strings` array to create a new array containing only the strings that start with the given prefix. The `startsWith()` method is used to check if a string starts with a given prefix.

In the example usage:
```javascript
console.log(filterByPrefix([], 'a')); // []
console.log(filterByPrefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a')); // ['abc', 'array']
```
The first call to `filterByPrefix()` with an empty array and prefix 'a' returns an empty array because there are no strings in the array that start with 'a'. The second call returns `['abc', 'array']` because these are the only two strings in the array that start with 'a'.

This solution should work for any input list of strings and any given prefix, filtering out the strings that don't start with the prefix.

Note: The `filter()` method is a built-in JavaScript array method that creates a new array containing elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.


In the above code, the `filter()` method is used to create a new array containing only the strings that start with the given prefix. The `startsWith()` method is used to check if a string starts with a given prefix.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of strings in the input array. This is because the `filter()` method needs to iterate through each string in the array to check if it starts with the given prefix.

The space complexity is O(1) because the function only creates a new array with the filtered strings, regardless of the size of the input array.

Overall, this function provides an efficient solution to filtering a list of strings based on whether or not they start with a given prefix.





Here are some additional notes to consider:
