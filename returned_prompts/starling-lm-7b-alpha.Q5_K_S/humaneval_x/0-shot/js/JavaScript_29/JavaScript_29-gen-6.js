The goal of this program is to filter an input list of strings only for ones that start with a given prefix.

The function `filterByPrefix` takes two parameters: `strings`, which is the input list of strings, and `prefix`, which is the prefix to filter by. It returns an array containing only the strings that start with the given prefix.

To solve this problem, you can use the `filter` method in JavaScript. The `filter` method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. In this case, the test is checking if each string in the `strings` array starts with the given `prefix`.

Here's the code for the `filterByPrefix` function:

```javascript
const filterByPrefix = (strings, prefix) => {
  return strings.filter(str => str.startsWith(prefix));
};
```

To use the `filterByPrefix` function, you can call it with an array of strings and a prefix, like this:

```javascript
filterByPrefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a');
```

This will return `['abc', 'array']`, as these are the only two strings in the input array that start with the letter 'a'.

You can also test the function with an empty array and a prefix to make sure it handles edge cases correctly:

```javascript
filterByPrefix([], 'a');
```

This will return an empty array, as there are no strings in the input array to filter.

Overall, the `filterByPrefix` function provides a convenient way to filter a list of strings based on a given prefix.

/* Filter an input list of strings only for ones that start with a given prefix.
  >>> filterByPrefix([], 'a')
  []
  >>> filterByPrefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a')
  ['abc', 'array']
  */
const filterByPrefix = (strings, prefix) => {
  return strings.filter(str => str.startsWith(prefix));
};
```

In this solution, the `filterByPrefix` function uses the `filter` method to iterate through each element in the `strings` array. It uses the `startsWith
