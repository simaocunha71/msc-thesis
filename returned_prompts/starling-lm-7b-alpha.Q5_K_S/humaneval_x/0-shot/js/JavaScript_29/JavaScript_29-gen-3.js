const result = strings.filter(str => str.startsWith(prefix));
return result;

Explanation:
The filter() method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
In this case, the function tests if the current string (str) starts with the given prefix. If so, the string is added to the result array.
If not, it is ignored.

In other words, the filter() method is used to filter the input array (strings) to only include strings that start with the given prefix.
The result is returned as a new array.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input array (strings). This is because the filter() method needs to check each element in the array.

The space complexity is also O(n), as the result array can have up to n elements, depending on the input array.

Overall, this function provides a concise and efficient way to filter an input array of strings based on a given prefix.
