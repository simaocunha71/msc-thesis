const result = strings.filter(string => string.startsWith(prefix));
return result;

Explanation:
In this code, we have a function called filterByPrefix that takes in two parameters: an array of strings and a prefix. The function uses the filter method to create a new array that only contains strings that start with the given prefix. The filter method takes in a callback function that is executed for each element in the input array. The callback function checks if the current string starts with the given prefix using the startsWith method. If it does, the string is included in the new array. Finally, the function returns the new array.

To test the function, we can use the console.log statements. The first test case checks if an empty array is passed as the input and the prefix is 'a'. Since there are no strings in the array, the function should return an empty array. The second test case checks if an array of strings ['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'] is passed as the input and the prefix is 'a'. The function should return an array with only the strings 'abc' and 'array' since they are the only ones that start with 'a'.

Overall, this function is useful for filtering an input list of strings based on a specific prefix, allowing us to extract only the relevant strings from a larger dataset.

// Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of strings in the input array.
// Space Complexity: O(1), since we are only using a fixed amount of additional memory to store the result.

// Note: The startsWith method is a string method that checks if a string starts with a specified prefix. It returns true if the string does start with the prefix, and false otherwise.

// The filter method is an array method that creates a new array containing only the elements that pass a test implemented by a provided function. It does not modify the original array.

// The callback function passed to the filter method is executed for each element in the input array. It takes in the current element as a parameter and returns a boolean value indicating whether the element should be included in the new array or not.

// The return statement in the function returns the new array containing the strings that start with the given prefix.

// In the provided test cases, we can see that the function correctly filters the input array based
