  The question is asking for the number of even and odd integer palindromes within a given range.
  In order to solve this problem, we must first identify what makes a palindrome.

  A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards. For example, 1221 is a palindrome.

  In order to determine if a number is a palindrome, we must check if the digits of the number read the same forwards and backwards.
  Since the digits of a palindrome must also be the same when reversed, we can reverse the digits of the number and check if it is equal to the original number.

  For example, let's consider the number 123.
  When reversed, the digits of the number become 321. If 123 is a palindrome, then 123 should be equal to 321. However, 123 is not equal to 321, so 123 is not a palindrome.

  To determine if a number is a palindrome, we can create a function that reverses the digits of a number and checks if the two numbers are equal.

  Next, we need to determine how many even and odd palindromes there are within a given range.

  An even number is divisible by 2, while an odd number is not divisible by 2.

  We can determine if a number is even by checking if it is divisible by 2. If a number is divisible by 2, then it is even. If a number is not divisible by 2, then it is odd.

  In order to determine how many even palindromes there are within a given range, we can use a for loop to iterate through the range and check if each number is a palindrome and even.

  Similarly, we can use a for loop to iterate through the range and check if each number is a palindrome and odd.

  Finally, we can return an array containing the number of even and odd palindromes within the given range.

  Here is a step-by-step explanation of how to solve the problem:

  1. Create a function to determine if a
