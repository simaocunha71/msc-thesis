To solve this problem, I will follow these steps:

1. Initialize two counters, one for even and one for odd palindromes.
2. Loop through the numbers from 1 to n.
3. For each number, check if it is a palindrome and if it is even or odd.
4. If the number is even, increment the even palindromes counter.
5. If the number is odd, increment the odd palindromes counter.
6. Return the result as an array with the even and odd palindromes counters.

Here's a detailed explanation of the code:

The function takes a positive integer n as input and initializes two counters, evenPalindromes and oddPalindromes, to 0.

Then, it enters a for loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive). For each number in this range, it checks if the number is a palindrome. If it is, it checks if the number is even or odd and increments the respective counter.

Finally, the function returns an array containing the even and odd palindromes counters.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the input number. The space complexity is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of extra space to store the counters.

Here's an example of how to use the function:

console.log(evenOddPalindrome(3)); // Output: [1, 2]
console.log(evenOddPalindrome(12)); // Output: [4, 6]

This function can be used to count the number of even and odd palindromes within a given range of numbers.

// Here is the solution to the problem:

function evenOddPalindrome(n) {
  let evenPalindromes = 0;
  let oddPalindromes = 0;

  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    const str = i.toString();
    if (str === str.split('').reverse().join('')) {
      if (i % 2 === 0) {
        evenPalindromes++;
      } else {
        oddPalindrom
