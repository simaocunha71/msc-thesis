To solve this problem, we can iterate through all numbers from 1 to n and check if they are palindromes. If the number is even, we increment an evenPalindromes counter, and if it's odd, we increment the oddPalindromes counter. Finally, we return the two counters in an array.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize evenPalindromes and oddPalindromes counters to 0.
2. Iterate through all numbers from 1 to n.
3. For each number, check if it is a palindrome. To do this, we can convert the number to a string and compare it with its reverse. If they are the same, the number is a palindrome.
4. If the number is a palindrome, increment the appropriate counter (even or odd) based on the number.
5. After iterating through all numbers, return the two counters in an array.

Here's the implementation of the solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
function evenOddPalindrome(n) {
  let evenPalindromes = 0;
  let oddPalindromes = 0;

  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    let str = i.toString();
    if (str === str.split('').reverse().join('')) {
      if (i % 2 === 0) {
        evenPalindromes++;
      } else {
        oddPalindromes++;
      }
    }
  }

  return [evenPalindromes, oddPalindromes];
}
```

This code will return an array with the number of even and odd integer palindromes within the range (1, n), inclusive.

For example, if we call `evenOddPalindrome(3)`, it will return `[1, 2]`, indicating that there is 1 even palindrome (2) and 2 odd palindromes (1, 3) within the range 1 to 3.

Similarly, if we call `evenOddPalindrome(12)`, it will return `[4, 6]`, indicating that there are 4 even
