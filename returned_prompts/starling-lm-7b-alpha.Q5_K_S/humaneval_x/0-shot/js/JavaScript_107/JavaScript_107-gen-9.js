To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize two counters: one for even palindromes and one for odd palindromes.
2. Iterate through the range from 1 to n, checking if each number is a palindrome.
3. If a number is a palindrome, check if it's even or odd and increment the corresponding counter.
4. Return the counters as the result.

Here's an implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
function evenOddPalindrome(n) {
  let evenCount = 0;
  let oddCount = 0;

  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    const numberAsString = i.toString();
    const reversed = numberAsString.split('').reverse().join('');

    if (numberAsString === reversed) {
      if (i % 2 === 0) {
        evenCount++;
      } else {
        oddCount++;
      }
    }
  }

  return [evenCount, oddCount];
}
```

In this code, we start by initializing two counters: `evenCount` and `oddCount` to keep track of the number of even and odd palindromes, respectively.

Then, we iterate through the range from 1 to n using a `for` loop. For each number, we convert it to a string and then reverse the string. We join the reversed characters back into a string and compare it with the original string. If they are the same, the number is a palindrome.

If the number is a palindrome, we check if it's even or odd. If it's even, we increment the `evenCount` counter; otherwise, we increment the `oddCount` counter.

Finally, we return the counters as an array `[evenCount, oddCount]`.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), as we only need to check each number once.

The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra memory to store the counters.

Overall, this solution provides the number of even and odd integer palindromes within the given range efficiently and with minimal
