The trick to find palindromes is to consider the first digit. If the first digit is odd, then the second digit must be even, and vice versa. This is because, for a number to be a palindrome, the digits from one end must reflect the other end. So, if the first digit is odd, the second digit must be even; and if the first digit is even, the second digit must be odd.

For example, a three-digit palindrome must follow the pattern ABA, where A is the first digit and B is the second digit. If A is odd, B must be even; if A is even, B must be odd.

So, to count the number of palindromes, we simply need to count the number of odd and even digits from 1 to n.

To find the count of even and odd palindromes, we can use the following steps:

1. Initialize two variables, even_count and odd_count, to 0. These variables will keep track of the count of even and odd palindromes, respectively.

2. Loop through the numbers from 1 to n. For each number, check if it is a palindrome by following these steps:
   a. Convert the number to a string.
   b. Check if the string is the same when reversed. If it is, then the number is a palindrome.
   c. If the number is a palindrome, increment the appropriate count variable (even_count if the number is even, or odd_count if the number is odd).

3. After looping through all the numbers, return the count of even and odd palindromes as an array [even_count, odd_count].

Here is an example implementation of the above steps in JavaScript:

```javascript
function evenOddPalindrome(n) {
  let even_count = 0;
  let odd_count = 0;

  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    let str = i.toString();
    if (str === str.split('').reverse().join('')) {
      if (i % 2 === 0) {
        even_count++;
      } else {
        odd_count++;
      }
