The solution here is to first find the intersection of the two intervals by finding the maximum of the start points and the minimum of the end points. Then, calculate the length of the intersection. If the intersection length is 0, it means the intervals don't intersect and we return "NO". If the intersection length is 1, it means the intersection is a single point and it is not a prime number, so we return "NO". Otherwise, we use the function isPrime to check if the intersection length is a prime number or not. If it is, we return "YES", otherwise we return "NO".

Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. Get the start and end points of the two intervals.
2. Find the maximum of the start points and the minimum of the end points to determine the intersection start and end points.
3. Calculate the length of the intersection by subtracting the intersection start from the intersection end and adding 1.
4. If the intersection length is 0, return "NO" as the intervals don't intersect.
5. If the intersection length is 1, return "NO" as a single point is not a prime number.
6. Otherwise, use the function isPrime to check if the intersection length is a prime number or not. If it is, return "YES", otherwise return "NO".

Here's the code for the solution:

```javascript
const intersection = (interval1, interval2) => {
  const [
