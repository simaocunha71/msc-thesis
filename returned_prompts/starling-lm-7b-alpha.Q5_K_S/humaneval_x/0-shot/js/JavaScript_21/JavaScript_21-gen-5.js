To solve this problem you need to follow these steps:

1. Find the smallest and largest number in the array.
2. Subtract the smallest number from all the elements in the array.
3. Divide all the elements in the array by the difference between the largest and smallest number.

Here's how you can implement the solution:

```javascript
const rescaleToUnit = (numbers) => {
  const smallest = Math.min(...numbers);
  const largest = Math.max(...numbers);
  return numbers.map(n => ((n - smallest) / (largest - smallest)));
};
```

In this solution, we use `Math.min()` and `Math.max()` to find the smallest and largest numbers in the array. Then, we use the `map()` function to apply the transform to each element in the array. 

The expression `((n - smallest) / (largest - smallest))` calculates the new value for each element in the array. It subtracts the smallest number from each element and then divides by the difference between the largest and smallest numbers. 

For example, if we call `rescaleToUnit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0])`, the function will return `[0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]`, which is the original array rescaled to the range [0, 1].

This solution ensures that the smallest number in the array becomes 0 and the largest number becomes 1, while all other numbers are scaled proportionally.
