To rescale a list of numbers to unit range, you can follow these steps:
1. Find the minimum and maximum values in the list.
2. Subtract the minimum value from all the numbers in the list.
3. Divide the result by the difference between the maximum and minimum values.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

Step 1: Find the minimum and maximum values in the list.
- Get the minimum value using the Math.min() function and passing the array as an argument: min = Math.min(...numbers);
- Get the maximum value using the Math.max() function and passing the array as an argument: max = Math.max(...numbers);

Step 2: Subtract the minimum value from all the numbers in the list.
- Use the map() function to iterate over the array and subtract the minimum value from each element: numbers.map(num => num - min);

Step 3: Divide the result by the difference between the maximum and minimum values.
- Use the map() function again to iterate over the array and divide each element by the difference between the maximum and minimum values: numbers.map(num => (num - min) / (max - min));

Finally, return the rescaled array:
return numbers;

For example, if you call rescaleToUnit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]), it will return [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0].
