To rescale the given list of numbers, we need to find the range of the numbers first. The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list. Then, we can divide each number by the range and multiply it by 1 to rescale it to the unit range [0, 1].

Here's how you can implement this in JavaScript:

```javascript
const rescaleToUnit = (numbers) => {
  const range = Math.max(...numbers) - Math.min(...numbers);
  return numbers.map(num => (num - Math.min(...numbers)) / range);
};
```

In this code, `Math.max(...numbers)` and `Math.min(...numbers)` are used to get the maximum and minimum values of the `numbers` list, respectively. The `...` operator is used to spread the `numbers` list as separate arguments to the `Math.max` and `Math.min` functions.

The `range` variable stores the difference between the maximum and minimum values. The `map` function is used to iterate over each number in the `numbers` list and apply the rescaling formula `(num - Math.min(...numbers)) / range` to each number. This formula subtracts the minimum value from each number, then divides the result by the range, effectively scaling the number to the unit range [0, 1].

Finally, the `map` function returns a new array with the rescaled numbers, which is then returned as the result of the `rescaleToUnit` function.

You can test this function with the provided example:

```javascript
console.log(rescaleToUnit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0])); // [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
```

This will output `[0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]`, which is the result of applying the linear transform to the original list of numbers.
