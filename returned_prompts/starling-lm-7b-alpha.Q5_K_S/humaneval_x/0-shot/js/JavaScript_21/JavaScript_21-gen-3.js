To rescale a list of numbers to the unit interval [0, 1], we need to find the range of the list and then apply a linear transform to each number in the list. The range of a list is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. To rescale the list, we can divide each number by the range and subtract the minimum value. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. Find the minimum and maximum values in the list. We can use Math.min and Math.max functions to find the minimum and maximum values, respectively.
2. Calculate the range by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value.
3. Apply the linear transform to each number in the list by dividing it by the range and subtracting the minimum value.
4. Return the transformed list.

Here's the code to implement the rescaleToUnit function:

```javascript
const rescaleToUnit = (numbers) => {
  const min = Math.min(...numbers);
  const max = Math.max(...numbers);
  const range = max - min;

  return numbers.map(number => (number - min) / range);
};
```

The rescaleToUnit function takes an array of numbers as an argument. It first finds the minimum and maximum values in the array using the Math.min and Math.max functions, respectively. Then, it calculates the range by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value. Finally, it applies the linear transform to each number in the array by dividing it by the range and subtracting the minimum value. The transformed array is then returned.

For example, if we call rescaleToUnit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]), the function will return [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]. The smallest number in the original array (1.0) becomes 0 in the transformed array, and the largest number (5.0) becomes 1.

This function can be used to rescale any list of numbers to the unit interval [0, 1] by applying a linear transform.
