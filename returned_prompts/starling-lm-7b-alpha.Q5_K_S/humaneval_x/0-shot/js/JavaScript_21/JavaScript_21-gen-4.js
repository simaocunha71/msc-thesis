To solve this kata, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the minimum and maximum numbers in the given list.
2. Calculate the range of the list by subtracting the minimum from the maximum.
3. Divide each number in the list by the range and multiply the result by the maximum number (1). This will rescale the numbers to the range [0, 1].
4. Return the rescaled list.

Here is the implementation of the solution:

```javascript
const rescaleToUnit = (numbers) => {
  const range = Math.max(...numbers) - Math.min(...numbers);
  return numbers.map(number => (number - Math.min(...numbers)) / range);
};
```

In this implementation, we use the spread operator (`...`) to pass all the numbers in the `numbers` array to the `Math.min()` and `Math.max()` functions. The `Math.max()` function returns the maximum value in the list, and the `Math.min()` function returns the minimum value. We calculate the range by subtracting the minimum from the maximum.

Next, we use the `map()` function to iterate over each number in the `numbers` array. For each number, we subtract the minimum from it and divide the result by the range. The result is then multiplied by the maximum number (1) to rescale the number to the range [0, 1]. The rescaled number is returned as part of a new array.

Finally, we return the rescaled array, which contains the original numbers transformed to the range [0, 1].

When you run the code with the example input `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]`, you will get the expected output `[0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]`.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.
