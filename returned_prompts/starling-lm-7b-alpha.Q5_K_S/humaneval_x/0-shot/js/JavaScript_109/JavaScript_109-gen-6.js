*/
In the given code, the moveOneBall function takes an array of integers as an argument and aims to determine whether it is possible to get the array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing right shift operations.

The function starts by checking the length of the array using the `length` property. This is stored in the `arrLength` variable. 

Then, a `for` loop is used to iterate through the array. The loop variable `i` represents the current index, which ranges from 0 to `arrLength - 1`. 

Inside the loop, the current index `currentIndex` and the next index `nextIndex` are assigned using the values of `i` and `i + 1`, respectively. 

A conditional statement is used to check if the value at the current index is greater than the value at the next index. If this condition is true, it means that the array is not in non-decreasing order, and the function returns `false`. 

If the loop completes without encountering any out-of-order elements, the function returns `true`, indicating that it is possible to achieve a non-decreasing order by performing right shift operations on the array. 

Finally, the function is called with an example array `[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]` and the result is printed to the console using `console.log`. 

In this case, the function will return `true` because it is possible to obtain a non-decreasing order by performing two right shift operations on the array. 

It's worth noting that if the given array is empty, the function will also return `true`.

Overall, the code efficiently checks whether the given array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by right shifting elements and returns the
