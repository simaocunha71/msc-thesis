To solve this problem we can follow these steps:

1. Create an object with array elements as keys and their indexes as values. This will allow us to track the indexes of all elements in the array.
2. Create an array of the indexes of all elements in the array.
3. Sort the array of indexes in ascending order.
4. Compare the sorted array of indexes with the indexes of elements in the original array. If they are the same, then it's possible to get a sorted array by performing the right shift operation. Otherwise, it's not possible.
5. Return the result.

Here is the code that implements the above algorithm:

const moveOneBall = (arr) => {
  let obj = {};
  let indexes = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    indexes.push(i);
    obj[arr[i]] = i;
  }

  indexes.sort((a, b) => arr[a] - arr[b]);

  return indexes.every((index, i) => index === obj[arr[i]]);
};

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, and the space complexity is O(n) to store the array of indexes.

Note: This solution assumes that the array is not empty. If the array is empty, it is considered that it is possible to get a sorted array by performing the right shift operation.

// Here's a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:

// 1. Create an object called 'obj' to store the indexes of the array elements. This is done using a for loop that iterates through the array and sets the index of each element as a key in the 'obj' object.

// 2. Create an array called 'indexes' to store the indexes of all the elements in the array. This is done using a for loop that iterates through the array and pushes the index of each element into the 'indexes' array.

// 3. Sort the 'indexes' array in ascending order. This is done using the 'sort' method of the array and passing a compare function
