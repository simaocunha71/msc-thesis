To solve this problem we need to find the maximum element in the array and then shift the array until the maximum element is at the first index. If the array is sorted, then the maximum element will be at the first index, and we can return true. Otherwise, we can return false. Here's how we can implement this:

1. Initialize a maximum element variable maxEl with the first element of the array.
2. Iterate through the array starting from the second element until the end of the array. For each element, compare it with the current maximum element. If the current element is greater than the maximum element, update the maximum element with the current element.
3. After the iteration, check if the maximum element is at the first index of the array. If it is, return true. Otherwise, return false.

Here's the code for the above steps:

const moveOneBall = (arr) => {
  let maxEl = arr[0];

  for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] > maxEl) {
      maxEl = arr[i];
    }
  }

  if (maxEl === arr[0]) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
};

This implementation has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array. It only requires a single pass through the array to find the maximum element, making it an efficient solution.

Note: This solution assumes that the input array is non-empty. If the array can be empty, you can add a check at the beginning of the function to return true if the array is empty.
