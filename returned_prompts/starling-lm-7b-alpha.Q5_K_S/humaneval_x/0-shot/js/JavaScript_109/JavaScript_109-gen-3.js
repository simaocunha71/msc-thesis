To solve this problem, we need to find out if the maximum element in the array is greater than the minimum element. If it is, we can right shift the array and continue until it is not. If the maximum is not greater than the minimum, we return false.

In the given array, let's first find the maximum and minimum elements:

max = Math.max(...arr);
min = Math.min(...arr);

Then, we check if max is greater than min. If it is, we return true. Otherwise, we right shift the array and repeat the process until max is not greater than min. If we reach this point, we return false.

Here's the code:

const moveOneBall = (arr) => {
  let max = Math.max(...arr);
  let min = Math.min(...arr);

  while (max > min) {
    const temp = arr.pop();
    arr.unshift(temp);
    max = Math.max(...arr);
    min = Math.min(...arr);
  }

  return max <= min;
};

The time complexity of the above solution is O(N), where N is the length of the array.

The space complexity is O(1), as we are not using any extra space.

The solution is also stable, meaning that the relative order of elements in the array is preserved during the shifting process.

In the worst case scenario, where the maximum and minimum elements are at the ends of the array, the solution will perform N shifts.

The space complexity of the solution is constant, as we are not using any additional data structures to store the array elements.

Here are some test cases to validate the solution:

moveOneBall([3, 4, 5, 1, 2]); // true
moveOneBall([3, 5, 4, 1, 2]); // false
moveOneBall([3, 4, 5, 6, 2, 1]); // true
moveOneBall([3, 4, 5, 2, 1]); // false
moveOneBall([3, 2, 1]); // true
moveOneBall([3, 5, 2, 1]); //
