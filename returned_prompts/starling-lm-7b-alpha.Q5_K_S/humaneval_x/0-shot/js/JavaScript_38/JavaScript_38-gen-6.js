To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Define the `encodeCyclic` function that takes in a string `s`. This function will create an array of groups, where each group is a slice of three characters from the input string. Then, it will iterate through each group and, if the group has three characters, it will swap the first and third characters. Finally, it will join the groups back together into a single string and return it.

2. Define the `decodeCyclic` function that takes in a string `s`. This function will follow the same logic as the `encodeCyclic` function but in reverse. It will create an array of groups, and for each group with three characters, it will swap the second and third characters. Then, it will join the groups back together into a single string and return it.

3. Test the functions by calling `encodeCyclic` with the input string "abc" and `decodeCyclic` with the output string "cba". The expected result is that `encodeCyclic("abc")` will return "cba" and `decodeCyclic("cba")` will return "abc".

The provided code implements these steps correctly and the test passes.

In the `encodeCyclic` function, the `for` loop iterates over the input string `s` in groups of three characters using the formula `(3 * i, Math.min((3 * i + 3), s.length))`. It pushes each group into the `groups` array.

Inside the `for...of` loop, the function checks if the
