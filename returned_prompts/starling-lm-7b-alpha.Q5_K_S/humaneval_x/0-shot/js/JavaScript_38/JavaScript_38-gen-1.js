To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Define the `encodeCyclic` function that takes a string `s` as an input. This function will return the encoded string by cycling groups of three characters.
   - Initialize two empty arrays, `groups` and `groups2`, to store the groups of characters.
   - Use a `for` loop to iterate over the length of the input string `s`. The loop will run until `i` is less than the length of `s` divided by 3, rounded up.
   - In each iteration, use the `slice` method to extract a group of three characters from the input string starting at index `3 * i` and ending at index `(3 * i + 3)`. If the extracted group is shorter than 3 characters, use `Math.min` to ensure it doesn't go out of bounds.
   - Push each group into the `groups` array.
   - Use another `for...of` loop to iterate over each group in the `groups` array.
   - Inside the loop, check if the length of the group is equal to 3. If it is, use the `slice` method to extract the second and third characters and concatenate them with the first character. Push the result into the `groups2` array. Otherwise, push the group as is into the `groups2` array.
   - Finally, use the `join` method to concatenate all the groups in the `groups2` array into a single string and return it.

2. Define the `decodeCyclic` function that takes a string `s` as an input. This function will return the decoded string.
   - Initialize an empty array `groups` to store the groups of characters.
   - Use a `for...of` loop to iterate over each character in the input string `s`.
   - Inside the loop, use the `slice` method to extract a group of three characters from the input string starting at index 0 and ending at index 3. If the extracted group is shorter than 3 characters, use `Math.min` to ensure it doesn't go out of bounds.
   - Push each group into the `groups` array.
   - Use another `for...of` loop to iterate over each group in the `
