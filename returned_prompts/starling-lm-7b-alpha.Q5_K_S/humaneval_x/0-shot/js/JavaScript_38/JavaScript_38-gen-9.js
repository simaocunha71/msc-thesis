I'm having some trouble understanding the code. Could someone explain what the `encodeCyclic` and `decodeCyclic` functions are supposed to do?

In the `encodeCyclic` function, we create two empty arrays, `groups` and `groups2`. Then, we use a for loop to iterate over the string `s`, adding a slice of three characters from `s` to the `groups` array every time.

The next for loop goes through each group in the `groups` array. If the length of the group is equal to 3, it takes the second and third characters and adds them to the front of the group, effectively swapping the positions of the second and third characters. This modified group is then pushed to the `groups2` array. If the length of the group is not equal to 3, the group is pushed to the `groups2` array as is.

Finally, the `groups2` array is joined into a string and returned as the result of the `encodeCyclic` function.

The `decodeCyclic` function takes a string `s` as input, which is assumed to be encoded using the `encodeCyclic` function. It uses a for loop to iterate over each character in the `s` string. If the length of the current group of three characters is equal to 3, it takes the second and third characters and adds them to the front of the group, effectively swapping the positions of the second and third characters. This modified group is then concatenated to the `result` string. If the length of the current group is not equal to 3, the group is concatenated to the `result` string as is.

Finally, the `result` string is returned as the result of the `decodeCyclic` function.

Overall, the `encodeCyclic` function takes a string as input and returns a new string where each group of three characters is encoded by swapping the positions of the second and third characters in each group. The `decodeCyclic` function takes a string as input, which is assumed to be encoded using the `encodeCyclic` function, and returns the original string by swapping the positions of the second and third characters in each group.

In the provided example, the `encodeCyclic` function is called with the string "abcdef
