I understand how the encodeCyclic function works, but I'm having trouble understanding how the decodeCyclic function works. Can you explain it to me?

In the decodeCyclic function, we start by initializing an empty array called "groups2". This array will hold all the substrings of the input string, which are three characters long.

Next, we iterate through each group in the "groups" array. The "groups" array is created by splitting the input string into groups of three characters. 

Inside the loop, we check if the length of the group is equal to 3. If it is, we concatenate the second and third characters of the group, and prepend the first character to the result. This operation effectively moves the first character to the end of the group. We then push this modified group to the "groups2" array.

If the length of the group is not equal to 3, we simply push the group as it is to the "groups2" array. This is necessary because some groups may have less than three characters, and we don't want to modify them.

Finally, we join all the substrings in the "groups2" array using the empty string as a separator, and return the resulting string. This gives us the original input string, which was encoded using the encodeCyclic function.

In summary, the decodeCyclic function works by splitting the input string into groups of three characters, modifying the groups where necessary, and then joining them back together to form the original string.

I hope this explanation helps you understand how the decodeCyclic function works. Let me know if you have any more questions!
