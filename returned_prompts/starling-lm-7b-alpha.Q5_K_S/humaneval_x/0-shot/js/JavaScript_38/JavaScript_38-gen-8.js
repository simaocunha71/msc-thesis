To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a function called `encodeCyclic` that takes a string `s` as input. This function will return an encoded string by cycling groups of three characters.

2. Initialize two empty arrays, `groups` and `groups2`.

3. Use a `for` loop to iterate from 0 to `Math.floor((s.length + 2) / 3)`. This loop will iterate through each group of three characters in the input string.

4. Inside the loop, use `s.slice(3 * i, Math.min((3 * i + 3), s.length))` to extract the current group of three characters from the input string. This will ensure that you don't go beyond the length of the input string.

5. Add the extracted group to the `groups` array.

6. Use another `for` loop to iterate through each group in the `groups` array.

7. Inside this loop, check if the length of the current group is equal to 3. If it is, use `group.slice(1) + group[0]` to create a new group with the first character moved to the end. This will create the cyclic pattern.

8. Add the new group to the `groups2` array. If the length of the current group is not equal to 3, add the group as is to the `groups2` array.

9. Return the joined string of all the groups in the `groups2` array using `groups2.join('')`. This will give you the encoded string.

10. Create another function called `decodeCyclic` that takes a string `s` as input. This function will return the decoded string from the encoded string generated by the `encodeCyclic` function.

11. Inside the `decodeCyclic` function, initialize an empty array called `groups`.

12. Use a `for` loop to iterate through each character in the input string `s`.

13. Inside the loop, use `s.slice(j, j + 3)` to extract a group of three characters from the input string.

14. Add the extracted group to the `groups` array.
