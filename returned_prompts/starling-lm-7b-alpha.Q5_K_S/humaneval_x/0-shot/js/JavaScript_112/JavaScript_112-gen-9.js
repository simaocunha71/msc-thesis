To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a variable named `result` and assign it the value of `s`. This variable will store the result after deleting the characters from `s` that are equal to any character in `c`.

2. Use a `for` loop to iterate through each character of `c`. For each character, use the `replace()` method to remove all occurrences of that character in `result`. Update the value of `result` after each removal.

3. After removing all the characters from `c` from `result`, check if the resulting string is a palindrome. You can do this by comparing the original string `result` with its reverse using the `String.split().reverse().join()` method. If they are the same, the string is a palindrome. Otherwise, it is not.

4. Return the result as a tuple containing the modified string `result` and a boolean value indicating whether the string is a palindrome or not.

Here's the implementation of the solution in JavaScript:

function reverseDelete(s, c) {
  let result = s;
  for (let i = 0; i < c.length; i++) {
    result = result.replace(new RegExp(c[i], 'g'), '');
  }
  return [result, result === result.split('').reverse().join('')];
}

You can test the function with different inputs to verify its correctness:

console.log(reverseDelete('abcde', 'ae')); // Output: ['bcd', false]
console.log(reverseDelete('abcdef', 'b')); // Output: ['acdef', false]
console.log(reverseDelete('abcdedcba', 'ab')); // Output: ['cdedc', true]
