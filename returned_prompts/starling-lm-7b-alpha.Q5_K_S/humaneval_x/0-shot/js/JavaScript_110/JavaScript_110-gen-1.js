To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize two variables, 'odd1' and 'odd2', to keep track of the number of odd elements in 'lst1' and 'lst2', respectively.
2. Iterate through the elements in 'lst1' and 'lst2', and increment the respective 'odd' variable whenever an odd number is encountered.
3. If the total number of odd elements in 'lst1' and 'lst2' is greater than half the length of 'lst1', return 'NO'. Otherwise, return 'YES'.
4. This is because, if the total number of odd elements is greater than half the length of 'lst1', it is impossible to exchange enough odd elements to make all elements in 'lst1' even.

Here's the code to implement the above steps:

```javascript
const exchange = (lst1, lst2) => {
  let odd1 = 0;
  let odd2 = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < lst1.length; i++) {
    if (lst1[i] % 2 !== 0) {
      odd1++;
    }
  }

  for (let i = 0; i < lst2.length; i++) {
    if (lst2[i] % 2 !== 0) {
      odd2++;
    }
  }

  if (odd1 + odd2 > lst1.length / 2) {
    return "NO";
  } else {
    return "YES";
  }
};
```

With this implementation, the function will return 'YES' if it is possible to exchange elements between 'lst1' and 'lst2' to make all elements in 'lst1' even, and 'NO' otherwise.

For example, if we call `exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4])`, the function will return 'YES' because it is possible to exchange elements between the two lists to make all the elements of the first list even. However, if we call `exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4])`,
