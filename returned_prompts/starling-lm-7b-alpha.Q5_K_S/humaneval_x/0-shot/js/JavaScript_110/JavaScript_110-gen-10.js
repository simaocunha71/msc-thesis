In this problem, you are asked to implement a function called `exchange` that takes two lists of numbers as input and determines if it is possible to perform an exchange of elements between them to make the first list `lst1` a list of only even numbers. There is no limit on the number of exchanged elements between `lst1` and `lst2`.

To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Initialize a counter variable `count` to keep track of the number of even elements in `lst1`. Set it to 0 initially.
2. Iterate through `lst1` using a `for` loop. For each element `lst1[i]`, check if it is even by using the modulo operator `%`. If the element is even (i.e., `lst1
