To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Define a function `factorial` that calculates the factorial of a number. This function will be used later in the `f` function.

2. Create an empty array called `result` to store the calculated values.

3. Iterate through the numbers from 1 to `n` using a `for` loop. For each number, check if it's even (i.e., divisible by 2) using the modulo operator `%`. If it's even, calculate the factorial using the `factorial` function and push the result to the `result` array. If it's odd, calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to `i` using another `for` loop and push the result to the `result` array.

4. Finally, return the `result` array.

By following these steps, the `f` function will return a list of size `n` with the desired values.

For example, if we call `f(5)`, the `result` array will contain `[1, 2, 6, 24, 15]`, which is the expected output.

Here's the code for the solution:

```javascript
const factorial = (n) => {
  let result = 1;
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    result *= i;
  }
