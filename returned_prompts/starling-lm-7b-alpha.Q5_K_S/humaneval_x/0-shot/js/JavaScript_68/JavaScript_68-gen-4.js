To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Create an object called node to store the smallest even value and its index. Initially, set its value to Infinity and its index to Infinity.
2. Initialize a variable i to 0, which will be used as a loop variable to iterate through the array.
3. Use a while loop to iterate through the array until the variable i reaches the length of the array.
4. Inside the loop, check if the current element, arr[i], is even by using the modulo operator (%). If the current element is even (i.e., arr[i] % 2 === 0), then:
   a. Compare the value of the current element with the value of the node object. If the current element is smaller than the value of the node object, update the node object with the current element's value and index.
5. After the loop finishes, return the node object as a list [node.value, node.index]. If there are no even values or the given array is empty, the node object will still have its initial values (Infinity, Infinity), and the returned list will be an empty list [].

Here's an example of how the code can be implemented in JavaScript:

```javascript
const pluck = (arr) => {
  let node = {value: Infinity, index: Infinity};
  let i = 0;

  while (i < arr.length) {
    let v = arr[i];
    if (v % 2 === 0) {
      if (v < node.value) node = {value: v, index: i};
    }
    i++;
  }

  return [node.value, node.index];
};
