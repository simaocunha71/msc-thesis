// This is a JavaScript program to calculate the area of a triangle using the formula: 
// area = (base * height) / 2

// The program defines a function called `triangleArea` that takes two arguments: `a` (the length of the base) and `h` (the height). 

// Inside the function, the area is calculated by multiplying the base and height and dividing by 2. 

// The calculated area is then returned as the result of the function. 

// The function is exported using `module.exports` so that it can be used in other parts of the program.
