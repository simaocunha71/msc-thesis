To solve this problem, you can compare the given values and return the larger one according to the variable type. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. First, check if both `a` and `b` are of the same type (either both integers, both floats, or both strings). If they are not, return null since you can't compare values of different types.
2. If both `a` and `b` are integers, compare them using the greater-than (`>`) operator. If `a` is greater, return `a`, otherwise return `b`.
3. If both `a` and `b` are floats, compare them using the greater-than (`>`) operator. If `a` is greater, return `a`, otherwise return `b`.
4. If both `a` and `b` are strings, compare them using the greater-than (`>`) operator. If `a` is greater, return `a`, otherwise return `b`. However, since the floating point might be represented as . or , you need to convert the strings to numbers using the `Number()` function and then compare the converted values.
5. If `a` and `b` are of different types, return null since you can't compare values of different types.
6. If `a` and `b` are equal, return null.

Here's the code implementation of the solution:

```javascript
const compareOne = (a, b) => {
  if (typeof a === typeof b) {
    if (typeof a === 'number') {
      return a > b ? a : b;
    } else {
      return String(a) > String(b) ? a : b;
    }
  } else {
    return null;
  }
};
```

You can now use the `compareOne` function to compare different types of values and return the larger one.
