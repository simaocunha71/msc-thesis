To solve this kata, you need to create a function that can compare two values and determine which one is larger. The function should accept integers, floats, or strings representing real numbers. If the numbers are represented as strings, they may use either a . or , as a decimal separator. The function should return the larger value of the two, or null if the values are equal.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. Start by defining the function `compareOne` that takes in two parameters, `a` and `b`.

2. Check if `a` and `b` are both integers using the `Number.isInteger(a)` and `Number.isInteger(b)` methods. If they are, compare them using the `Math.max()` function, which returns the larger of two numbers.

3. If `a` and `b` are not both integers, check if either of them is a float using the `Number.isFinite(a)` and `Number.isFinite(b)` methods. If one of them is a float and the other is an integer, convert the integer to a float using the `parseFloat()` function and compare them using `Math.max()`. If both are floats, compare them directly using `Math.max()`.

4. If neither `a` nor `b` are integers or floats, check if they are both strings using the `typeof a === 'string'` and `typeof b === 'string'` conditions. If they are both strings, check if the strings can be parsed as floats using the `parseFloat()` function. If both strings can be parsed as floats, compare them using `Math.max()`. If only one of the strings can be parsed as a float, return the parsed float directly. If neither string can be parsed as a float, return null.

5. If `a` and `b` are not both strings, it means one of them is a float and the other is an integer. Convert the integer to a float using `parseFloat()` and compare them using `Math.max()`.

6. Finally, return the larger value or null if the values are equal.

The code provided implements this logic and can be used to solve the kata.
