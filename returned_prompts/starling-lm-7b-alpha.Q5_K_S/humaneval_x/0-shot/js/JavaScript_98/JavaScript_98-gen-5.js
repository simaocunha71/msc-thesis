To count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices of the string, you can follow these steps:

1. Define a function called countUpper that takes a string as an argument.
2. Declare a variable called count and initialize it to 0. This variable will keep track of the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.
3. Use a for loop to iterate through the string. Start the loop at index 0 and continue until index < length of the string. Increment the index by 2 in each iteration. This is because we want to count uppercase vowels in even indices, and the loop will only check odd-indexed characters.
4. Inside the loop, check if the current character at index is an uppercase vowel (A, E, I, O, or U). You can use the JavaScript String method charCodeAt() to get the ASCII code of the character and check if it falls within the range of uppercase vowel ASCII codes (65 to 69). If it does, increment the count variable by 1.
5. After the loop finishes, return the value of the count variable.

Here's the code for the countUpper function:

```javascript
const countUpper = (s) => {
  let count = 0;
  for (let index = 0; index < s.length; index += 2) {
    if (s[index] >= 65 && s[index] <= 69) {
      count++;
    }
  }
  return count;
};
```

You can use this function to count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices of a string. For example, countUpper('aBCdEf') will return 1, countUpper('abcdefg') will return 0, and countUpper('dBBE') will also return 0.

```python
def count_upper(s):
    count = 0
    for index in range(0, len(s), 2):
        if s[index] in ('A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'):
            count += 1
    return count
```

To use the function, you can simply
