To count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize a counter variable to keep track of the number of uppercase vowels found.
2. Iterate through the given string `s` using a `for` loop or `forEach` method, starting from the first character and moving on to the next character.
3. Check if the current character is an uppercase vowel (A, E, I, O, U) and if its index is even (i.e., `i % 2 === 0`). If both conditions are met, increment the counter variable.
4. After iterating through all the characters, return the value of the counter variable, which represents the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.

Here's a sample implementation of the `countUpper` function in JavaScript:

```javascript
const countUpper = (s) => {
  let count = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    if (s[i].toUpperCase() === s[i] && i % 2 === 0) {
      count++;
    }
  }

  return count;
};
```

This implementation uses a `for` loop to iterate through each character of the string `s`. The `toUpperCase()` method is used to check if the character is an uppercase vowel, and the `i % 2 === 0` condition ensures that the character is at an even index. If both conditions are true, the `count` variable is incremented. Finally, the function returns the value of `count`, which represents the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.

You can test the `countUpper` function with different inputs to verify its correctness.

For example:

```javascript
console.log(countUpper('aBCdEf'));    // Output: 1
console.log(countUpper('abcdefg'));   // Output: 0
console.log(countUpper('dBBE'));      // Output: 0
```

In the first test case, the function correctly counts the uppercase vowel 'B' at index 1, resulting in an output of 1. In the second
