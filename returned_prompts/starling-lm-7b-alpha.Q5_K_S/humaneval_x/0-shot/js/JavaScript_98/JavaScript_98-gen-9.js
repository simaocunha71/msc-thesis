To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Initialize a variable `upperCount` to keep track of the number of uppercase vowels in even indices. Set its initial value to 0.
2. Iterate through the string `s` using a `for` loop, starting from the first character (index 0) and ending at the last character. You can use the `length` property of the string to determine the stopping point.
3. Inside the loop, check if the current index `i` is divisible by 2 (even index). If it is, proceed to the next step. Otherwise, continue to the next iteration of the loop.
4. Check if the current character `s[i]` is an uppercase vowel. You can use the `match()` method with the regular expression `/[AEIOU]/i` to find all the uppercase vowels in the string. This method returns an array of all matches, or `null` if there are no matches.
5. If the `match()` method returns an array with at least one element (i.e., there is at least one uppercase vowel in the string), increment the `upperCount` variable by 1.
6. After the loop finishes, return the value of `upperCount`.
7. If there are no uppercase vowels in the string, the function will return 0.

Here's an example implementation of the solution:

```javascript
const countUpper = (s) => {
  let upperCount = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    if (i % 2 === 0) {
      const matches = s[i].match(/[AEIOU]/i);
      if (matches && matches.length > 0) {
        upperCount += 1;
      }
    }
  }

  return upperCount;
};
```

This implementation uses a `for` loop to iterate through the string `s`. Inside the loop, it checks if the current index `i` is divisible by 2 (even index) using the modulo operator (`%`). If it is, it uses the `match()` method with the regular expression `/[AEIOU
