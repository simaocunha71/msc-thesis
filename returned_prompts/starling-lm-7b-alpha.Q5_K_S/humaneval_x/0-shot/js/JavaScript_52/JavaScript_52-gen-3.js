    return l.every(num => num < t);


Explanation:
The provided code defines a function called belowThreshold that takes in two parameters, l and t. The function uses the every() method on the array l to check if every element of the array is less than the threshold t. The every() method returns true if all elements in the array satisfy the provided testing function, and false otherwise. In this case, the testing function is a simple arrow function that checks if each element (denoted by the parameter num) is less than t. If all elements in l are less than t, the function will return true; otherwise, it will return false.

The code then provides two example test cases to demonstrate the functionality of the function. The first test case, belowThreshold([1, 2, 4, 10], 100), checks if all numbers in the list [1, 2, 4, 10] are below the threshold of 100. Since all numbers in the list are indeed below 100, the function will return true. The second test case, belowThreshold([1, 20, 4, 10], 5), checks if all numbers in the list [1, 20, 4, 10] are below the threshold of 5. However, the number 20 is not below 5, so the function will return false.
