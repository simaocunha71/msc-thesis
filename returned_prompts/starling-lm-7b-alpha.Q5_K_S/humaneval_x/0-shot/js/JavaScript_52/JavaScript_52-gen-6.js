To determine if all numbers in a given list are below a certain threshold, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a function called `belowThreshold` that takes two parameters: `l` (the list of numbers) and `t` (the threshold value).
2. Initialize a boolean variable called `result` to `true`. This variable will keep track of whether all numbers in the list are below the threshold.
3. Iterate through each number in the list using a `for...of` loop. For each number, compare it with the threshold value.
4. If a number is greater than or equal to the threshold, set the `result` variable to `false`. This means that at least one number in the list is not below the threshold.
5. After iterating through all the numbers in the list, check the value of the `result` variable. If it is still `true`, all numbers in the list are below the threshold, and you can return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.
6. Test the function by calling it with different inputs and checking the output using asserts. Use the `>>>` syntax for multi-line comments to provide explanations for each test case.

Here's an example implementation of the `belowThreshold` function:

```javascript
const belowThreshold = (l, t) => {
  let result = true;
  for (const num of l) {
    if (num >= t) {
      result = false;
    }
  }
  return result;
};
```

You can test the function with the provided test cases:

```javascript
console.assert(belowThreshold([1, 2, 4, 10], 100) === true, "Test 1: All numbers in the list are below the threshold");
console.assert(belowThreshold([1, 20, 4, 10], 5) === false, "Test 2: At least one number in the list is not below the threshold");
```

These assertions will check if the function returns the expected values for the given test cases. If all assertions pass, the function is correct.

Note: Make sure to include the `console.assert` statements in your code when testing the function.
