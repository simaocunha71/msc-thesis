const firstK = arr.slice(0,k)
let sum = 0

for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
  if (String(firstK[i]).length <= 2) {
    sum += firstK[i]
  }
}

return sum
};

B:

const addElements = (arr, k) => {
  return arr.slice(0, k).filter(num => String(num).length <= 2).reduce((acc, cur) => acc + cur, 0);
};

C:

const addElements = (arr, k) => {
  const acc = arr.slice(0,k).reduce((acc, cur) => acc + (String(cur).length <= 2 ? cur : 0), 0);
  return acc
};

ANSWER: B

Explanation:

In this problem, we are asked to find the sum of all elements in the array with at most 2 digits in the first k elements. We can solve it by using the Array.slice() and Array.filter() methods to filter out the elements with at most 2 digits, and then use the Array.reduce() method to sum up the filtered elements.

Here's the detailed step-by-step explanation:

1. First, we use the Array.slice() method to extract the first k elements from the array and assign it to the variable "firstK". This allows us to only consider the first k elements for the sum calculation.

2. Next, we use the Array.filter() method to filter out the elements with at most 2 digits from the "firstK" array. We check the length of each element in the "firstK" array using the String() method, and if the length is less than or equal to 2, we keep that element in the filtered array.

3. After filtering out the elements with at most 2 digits, we use the Array.reduce() method to sum up all the filtered elements. The reduce() method takes a callback function that adds up the current element (cur) to the accumulator (acc) in each iteration. The initial value of the accumulator is set to 0.

4. Finally, we
