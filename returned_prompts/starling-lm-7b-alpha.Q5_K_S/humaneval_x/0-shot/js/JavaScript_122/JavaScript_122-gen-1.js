B:
const addElements = (arr, k) => {
const result = arr.slice(0, k).reduce((acc, curr) => {
  if(curr.toString().length <= 2) {
    acc += curr;
  }
  return acc;

return result;
};

C:
const addElements = (arr, k) => {
  const result = arr.slice(0, k).reduce((acc, curr) => {
    if(curr.toString().length <= 2) {
      acc += curr;
    }
    return acc;
  }, 0);
  return result;
};

D:
const addElements = (arr, k) => {
  const result = arr.slice(0, k).reduce((acc, curr) => {
    if(curr.toString().length <= 2) {
      acc += curr;
    }
    return acc;
  }, 0);
  return result;
};

/*
Explanation:
The key to this problem is to use the reduce method to sum up the first k elements from the array, but only if the length of the number is less than or equal to 2. We can achieve this by using the slice method to get the first k elements of the array, then using the reduce method to sum them up. We use the length property of the number to check if the length of the number is less than or equal to 2.

In the code, we first define a function called addElements that takes an array and an integer as arguments. We then use the slice method to get the first k elements of the array, and use the reduce method to sum them up. We use the length property of the number to check if the length of the number is less than or equal to 2.

Here are the explanations for each code block:

A: This code block defines the function addElements and uses the slice method to get the first k elements of the array, and uses the reduce method to sum
