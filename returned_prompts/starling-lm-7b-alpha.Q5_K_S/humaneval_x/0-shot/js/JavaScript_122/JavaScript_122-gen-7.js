// O(n) time complexity
// O(1) space complexity

Here is my code:

Answer:
Here is a simplified solution:

```
function addElements(arr, k) {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    if (arr[i].toString().length <= 2) {
      sum += arr[i];
    }
  }
  return sum;
}
```

The time complexity is O(n) because we are looping through all the elements of the array.
The space complexity is O(1) because we are not using any extra space that grows with the size of the input.

Explanation:

In this solution, we use a for loop to iterate through the first k elements of the array. We then check if the length of the string representation of each element is less than or equal to 2. If it is, we add the element to the sum. Finally, we return the sum.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) because we are looping through all the elements of the array. The space complexity is O(1) because we are not using any extra space that grows with the size of the input.

You can verify the solution by running the provided test cases.

Here is the test case:

```
console.log(addElements([111,21,3,4000,5,6,7,8,9], 4)); // 24
```

The output should be:

```
24
```

This means that the sum of the elements with at most two digits from the first 4 elements of the array [111,21,3,4000,5,6,7,8,9] is 24.

The solution correctly handles the given constraints and produces the expected output.

I hope this helps!
