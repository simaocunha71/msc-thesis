To solve this problem we can use the `sort()` method to sort the numbers in the string from smallest to largest. However, the `sort()` method sorts the numbers as strings, so we need to convert them back to numbers after sorting.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to implement the solution:

1. Split the input string into an array of individual numbers using the `split()` method and passing a space (' ') as the separator. This will give us an array of strings: `['three', 'one', 'five']`.

2. Convert each string in the array to a number using the `map()` method. This will give us a new array of numbers: `[3, 1, 5]`.

3. Sort the array of numbers using the `sort()` method. This will sort the numbers from smallest to largest: `[1, 3, 5]`.

4. Convert each number in the array back to a string using the `map()` method. This will give us a new array of strings: `['one', 'three', 'five']`.

5. Join the array of strings back into a single string using the `join()` method and passing a space (' ') as the separator. This will give us the final sorted string: `'one three five'`.

Here's the implementation of the solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
function sortNumbers(numbers) {
  return numbers.split(' ').map(Number).sort((a, b) => a - b).map(String).join(' ');
}
```

You can test the function with the provided example:

```javascript
console.log(sortNumbers('three one five'));  // Output: 'one three five'
```

This will return the sorted string as expected.

In summary, the `sortNumbers` function takes a space-delimited string of numbers, splits it into an array, converts the strings to numbers, sorts them, converts them back to strings, and joins them back into a single string.
