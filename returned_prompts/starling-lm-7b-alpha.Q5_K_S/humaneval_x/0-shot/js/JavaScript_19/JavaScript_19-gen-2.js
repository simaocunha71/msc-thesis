To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Split the input string into an array of number strings using the space character as the delimiter.
2. Sort the array of number strings in ascending order using the `sort()` method and a custom comparison function. The custom comparison function compares the parsed integer values of the number strings.
3. Join the sorted array back into a string using the space character as the delimiter.
4. Return the sorted string.

Here's the code that implements these steps:

```javascript
const sortNumbers = (numbers) => {
  const numberStrings = numbers.split(' ');
  numberStrings.sort((a, b) => {
    const numberA = parseInt(a);
    const numberB = parseInt(b);
    return numberA - numberB;
  });
  return numberStrings.join(' ');
};
```

Note that this implementation assumes that all the strings in the input are valid representations of numbers between "zero" and "nine". If you need to handle invalid inputs, you may want to add error checking code.

Also, note that the `parseInt()` function is used to convert the number strings to integers for comparison. This is necessary because the `sort()` method compares strings lexicographically (i.e., based on their Unicode character codes), and we want to compare the values of the numbers instead.

Finally, the `join()` method is used to concatenate the sorted array elements back into a string, using a space as the separator.

By following these steps and using the provided code, you can sort the numbers from smallest to largest in the input string.
