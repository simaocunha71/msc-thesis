To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Define a function called `selectWords` that takes two parameters: `s` (the input string) and `n` (the number of consonants we want in a word).

2. Create a variable called `vowels` and assign it a string of all vowel characters. This will be used to check if a character is a consonant or not.

3. Create a function called `consonants` that takes a character as input and returns `true` if the character is a consonant (i.e., it is not a vowel), and `false` otherwise.

4. Split the input string `s` into an array of words using the `split` method and passing a space as the separator. This will give us an array of all the words in the string.

5. Create an empty array called `result` to store the words that meet the criteria.

6. Iterate over each word in the `words` array using the `forEach` method.

7. For each word, check if the first character is a consonant (using the `consonants` function) and if the length of the word minus 1 is equal to the desired number of consonants `n`. If
