To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize a variable called 'strongest_extension' with the value of the first extension in the list. This variable will store the strongest extension we find so far.
2. Initialize a variable called 'strength' with the value of the strength of the first extension in the list. This variable will store the strength of the strongest extension we find so far.
3. Iterate through the list of extensions using a for loop. For each extension:
    a. Calculate the strength of the extension using the formula 'CAP - SM', where 'CAP' is the number of uppercase letters in the extension's name and 'SM' is the number of lowercase letters in the extension's name.
    b. If the strength of the current extension is greater than the strength of the current strongest_extension, update strongest_extension and strength with the values of the current extension.
4. Return the class_name concatenated with the strongest_extension.

Here is the code that implements these steps:

```javascript
const strongestExtension = (class_name, extensions) => {
  let strongest_extension = extensions[0];
  let strength = strongest_extension.length;

  for (let ext of extensions) {
    let cap = (ext.match(/[A-Z]/g) || []).length;
    let sm = (ext.match(/[a-z]/g) || []).length;
    let extStrength = cap - sm;

    if (extStrength > strength) {
      strongest_extension = ext;
      strength = extStrength;
    }
  }

  return `${class_name}.${strongest_extension}`;
};
```

This code defines a function called 'strongestExtension' that takes two parameters: 'class_name' (the name of the class) and 'extensions' (a list of extensions). It initializes the 'strongest_extension' and 'strength' variables with the values of the first extension in the list. Then, it iterates through each extension in the list, calculates the strength of the extension using the given formula, and updates the 'strongest_extension' and 'strength' variables if a stronger extension is found. Finally, it returns the class_
