To solve this problem, you can use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize an empty stack.
2. Iterate through the brackets string.
3. For each character in the string:
    - If the character is an opening bracket ('('), push it onto the stack.
    - If the character is a closing bracket (')'), pop the top element off the stack.
4. Check if the stack is empty. If it's not, it means there are unmatched opening brackets, and the function should return false. Otherwise, return true.

Here's the code implementation of the solution:

```javascript
const correctBracketing = (brackets) => {
  const stack = []; // Step 1: Initialize an empty stack

  for (let char of brackets) {
    if (char === '(') {
      stack.push(char); // Step 3: Push opening brackets onto the stack
    } else if (char === ')') {
      stack.pop(); // Step 3: Pop closing brackets from the stack
    }
  }

  return stack.length === 0; // Step 4: Check if the stack is empty
};
```

You can test the function with the provided test cases:

```javascript
console.log(correctBracketing("(")); // false
console.log(correctBracketing("()")); // true
console.log(correctBracketing("(()())")); // true
console.log(correctBracketing(")(()")); // false
```

The output will be:

```
false
true
true
false
```

This solution uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets. It iterates through the brackets string and pushes opening brackets onto the stack while popping closing brackets off the stack. Finally, it checks if the stack is empty to determine if all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the brackets string.

The space complexity is also O(n)
