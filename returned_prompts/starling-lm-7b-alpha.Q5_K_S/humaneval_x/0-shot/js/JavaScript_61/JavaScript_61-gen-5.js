To solve this problem we need to keep track of the number of opening brackets and closing brackets we see. If the number of opening brackets is greater than the number of closing brackets when we reach the end of the string, then we know that there are not enough closing brackets to match all of the opening brackets, and thus the bracketing is incorrect.

We can solve this problem by using a while loop and a counter variable. We will decrement the counter variable each time we see an opening bracket, and increment it each time we see a closing bracket. If the counter variable is less than zero at the end of the loop, then there are not enough closing brackets to match the opening brackets, and thus the bracketing is incorrect.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize a counter variable to zero. This variable will keep track of the number of opening brackets we have seen.

2. Use a while loop to iterate through the brackets string. Break out of the loop when we reach the end of the string.

3. Inside the loop, check if the current character is an opening bracket (i.e., "("). If it is, decrement the counter variable by one. If the counter variable becomes less than zero, then break out of the loop, because there are not enough closing brackets to match the opening brackets.

4. If the current character is not an opening bracket, then it must be a closing bracket (i.e., ")"). Increment the counter variable by one.

5. After the loop is finished, check if the counter variable is less than zero. If it is, then the bracketing is incorrect. Otherwise, the bracketing is correct.

Here is the code that implements this solution:

```javascript
const correctBracketing = (brackets) => {
  let counter = 0;

  while (brackets.length > 0) {
    const current = brackets[0];
    if (current === "(") {
      counter--;
    } else {
      counter++;
    }
    brackets = brackets.slice(1);
    if (counter < 0) {
      break;
