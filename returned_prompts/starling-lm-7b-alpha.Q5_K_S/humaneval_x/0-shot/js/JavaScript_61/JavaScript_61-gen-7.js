Here's a possible solution using JavaScript:

```
const correctBracketing = (brackets) => {
  let stack = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < brackets.length; i++) {
    if (brackets[i] === '(') {
      stack.push(brackets[i]);
    } else if (brackets[i] === ')') {
      if (stack.length === 0) {
        return false;
      } else {
        stack.pop();
      }
    }
  }
  return stack.length === 0;
};
```

This solution uses an array called `stack` to keep track of the opening brackets encountered. For each character in the `brackets` string, if the character is an opening bracket `'('`, it is pushed onto the stack. If the character is a closing bracket `')'`, the solution checks if the stack is empty. If it is empty, this means there is no corresponding opening bracket for the closing bracket, so the solution returns `false`. If the stack is not empty, the solution pops the top element off the stack, which represents the corresponding opening bracket for the closing bracket. After iterating through all the characters in the `brackets` string, the solution checks if the stack is empty. If it is empty, this means all opening brackets have a corresponding closing bracket, and the solution returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

You can use this solution to check if the `brackets` string has a correct bracketing.

Here are some test cases to demonstrate the solution:

```
console.log(correctBracketing("(")); // false
console.log(correctBracketing("()")); // true
console.log(correctBracketing("(()())")); // true
console.log(correctBracketing(")(()")); // false
```

These test cases show the expected output for different inputs to the `correctBracketing` function.

Overall, this solution uses a stack data structure to keep track of opening brackets and checks if all opening brackets have a corresponding closing bracket.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any
