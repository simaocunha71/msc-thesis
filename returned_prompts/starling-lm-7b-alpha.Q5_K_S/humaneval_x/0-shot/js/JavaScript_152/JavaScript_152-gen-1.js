To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Create an empty array to store the results called "result".
2. Iterate through each pair of scores and guesses using a for loop or the array methods map or forEach.
3. Inside the loop, calculate the absolute difference between the score and the guess using the Math.abs() function.
4. Push the absolute difference to the "result" array using the push() method.
5. After the loop, return the "result" array.

Here's an example of how you can implement this in JavaScript:

function compare(game, guess) {
  let result = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < game.length; i++) {
    result.push(Math.abs(game[i] - guess[i]));
  }

  return result;
}

You can test the function with the provided examples:

console.log(compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2])); // Output: [0,0,0,0,3,3]
console.log(compare([0,5,0,0,0,4],[4,1,1,0,0,-2])); // Output: [4,4,1,0,0,6]

This implementation will correctly calculate the absolute difference between each pair of scores and guesses, and store the results in the "result" array.
