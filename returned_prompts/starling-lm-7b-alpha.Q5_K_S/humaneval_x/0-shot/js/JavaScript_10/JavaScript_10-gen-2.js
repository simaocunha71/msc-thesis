Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. First, the function checks if the given string is empty. If it is, it returns an empty string, as an empty string is a palindrome by definition.

2. The function then uses the `split('')` method to convert the string into an array of its individual characters. This is necessary to reverse the string later.

3. The `reverse()` method is called on the array to reverse the order of its elements.

4. The `join('')` method is called on the reversed array to convert it back into a string.

5. The original string is compared to the reversed string using the `===` operator. If they are equal, it means that the string is a palindrome. In this case, the function returns true.

6. If the original string is not a palindrome, the function continues to find the longest postfix of the string that is a palindrome. This is done by iterating through the string starting from the end and checking if each substring is a palindrome.

7. Once the longest palindromic postfix is found, the function appends the reverse of the string prefix (the part before the palindromic suffix) to the end of the string.

8. The resulting string is then checked again to see if it is a palindrome. If it is, the function returns the string. If not, the function continues to find the next longest palindromic postfix and appends the reverse of the prefix again. This process is repeated until a palindrome is found.

9. Finally, the function returns the shortest palindrome that begins with the supplied string.

Overall, the solution uses a combination of string manipulation and palindrome detection techniques to find the shortest palindrome that starts with the given string.

makePalindrome('cata')

Answer:
'catac'

Explanation:
The function makePalindrome takes a string as an argument and returns the shortest palindrome that begins with the supplied string.

In this case, the supplied string is 'cata'. The function first checks if the string is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse. Since 'cata' is not a
