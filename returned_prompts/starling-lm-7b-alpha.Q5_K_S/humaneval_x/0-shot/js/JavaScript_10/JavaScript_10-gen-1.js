The algorithm to find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string is as follows:

1. Find the longest palindromic prefix of the string. This can be done by repeatedly splitting the string in half and checking if the left and right halves are equal (i.e., a palindrome). The last non-equal pair of halves will be the longest palindromic prefix.

2. Once the longest palindromic prefix is found, check if the remaining part of the string is equal to its reverse. If it is, then the string is already a palindrome, and no further processing is needed. Otherwise, append the reverse of the non-palindromic part to the front of the string and return the result.

3. This process ensures that the resulting string is the shortest palindrome that begins with the supplied string.

In the provided code, the `isPalindrome` function checks if a string is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse. The `makePalindrome` function uses this helper function to find the longest palindromic prefix of the string and then checks if the remaining part is equal to its reverse. If not, it appends the reverse of the non-palindromic part to the front of the string and returns the result.

For example, if you call `makePalindrome('cata')`, it will return `'catac'` because the longest palindromic prefix of 'cata' is 'ata', and appending the reverse of 'ca' to the front of the string results in the shortest palindrome that begins with 'cata'.

Overall, the algorithm and the provided code allow you to efficiently find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string.
