Here's the step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. The function `makePalindrome` takes a string as an argument.

2. The function initializes a variable `longestPalindromePrefix` with an empty string. This variable will store the longest palindromic prefix of the input string.

3. The function enters a while loop that runs until the `longestPalindromePrefix` is the entire string. This loop is used to find the longest palindromic prefix of the input string.

4. Inside the while loop, the function initializes a variable `i` with 0. This variable will be used as an index to check substrings of the input string.

5. The function checks if the substring from index 0 to index `i` is a palindrome using the `isPalindrome` function. If it is a palindrome, the function updates the `longestPalindromePrefix` variable with the current substring.

6. The function increments the `i` variable by 1 and continues checking the next substring. This process continues until a palindrome is found.

7. After finding the longest palindromic prefix, the function appends the reverse of the input string's prefix (subtring from index 0 to `i`) to the end of the input string. This is done using the `substring` method to extract the prefix, the `split` method to convert the prefix into an array of characters, the `reverse` method to reverse the array, and the `join` method to convert the reversed array back into a string.

8. The function returns the modified string, which is now the shortest palindrome that begins with the supplied string.

Here's an example of how the code works:

- When `makePalindrome('cat')` is called, the while loop runs until the `longestPalindromePrefix` is 'cat'. The function appends the reverse of the input string's prefix ('c') to the end of the input string ('cat'), resulting in the shortest palindrome 'catac'.

- When `makePalindrome('cata')` is called, the while loop runs until the `longestPalindromePrefix` is 'cata'. Since 'cata' is already a pal
