Here's the step by step explanation of the algorithm:

1. Take the supplied string, let's call it S.
2. Find the longest suffix of S that is a palindrome. In other words, find the longest prefix of the reversed string that is also the prefix of the original string. In the example below, the longest palindromic suffix of 'cata' is 'ata' (the reversed 'ata' is 'ata', and it's also a prefix of 'cata').
3. If the longest palindromic suffix is the whole string, then the function returns the string, as it's already a palindrome.
4. If the longest palindromic suffix isn't the whole string, then it's the longest common prefix of the original and the reversed string. In the example below, the longest common prefix of 'cata' and 'atac' is 'at'.
5. Append to the end of the string the reversed string prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix. In the example below, 'ata' is the longest palindromic suffix of 'cata', and 'c' is the reversed prefix that comes before it. So, the result is 'catac'.

Here's the implementation of the algorithm in JavaScript:

```javascript
const makePalindrome = (string) => {
  // Step 2: Find the longest palindromic suffix
  const suffix = string.match(/(.+)?\b(\w+)\1+/)[1];

  // Step 3: If the longest palindromic suffix is the whole string
  if (suffix === string) {
    return string;
  }

  // Step 4: Find the common prefix of the original and the reversed string
  const prefix = string.slice(0, suffix.length);

  // Step 5: Append the reversed string prefix to the end of the string
  return string + prefix.split('').reverse().join('');
}
```

Hope this helps!
