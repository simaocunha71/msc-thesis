To solve this kata, you must return the sorted unique elements in a list.
In other words, you must return a sorted list of unique elements.

To accomplish this, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new set from the input list. This will automatically remove any duplicate values from the list.
2. Convert the set back to an array to obtain the unique elements.
3. Sort the array using the `sort()` method and a custom comparison function to ensure that the elements are sorted in ascending order.
4. Return the sorted array.

Here's the code implementation:

```javascript
const unique = (l) => {
  const set = new Set(l);
  return [...set].sort((a, b) => a - b);
};
```

This code creates a new set `set` from the input list `l` using the `Set` object. The `Set` object automatically removes any duplicate values from the list.

Next, it converts the set back to an array using the spread syntax `[...set]`. This creates a new array with all the unique elements from the set.

Finally, it sorts the array using the `sort()` method and a custom comparison function `(a, b) => a - b`. This ensures that the elements are sorted in ascending order.

The sorted array of unique elements is then returned as the result.

When you run the provided test case `unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])`, it should return `[0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]`, which is the sorted unique elements from the input list.

Note that the `sort()` method sorts the array in place, modifying the original array. If you want to preserve the original array, you can make a copy of it before sorting.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
