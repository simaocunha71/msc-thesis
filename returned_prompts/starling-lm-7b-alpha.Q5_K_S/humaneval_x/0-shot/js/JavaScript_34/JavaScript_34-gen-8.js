    return [...new Set(l)].sort((a, b) => a - b);


Explanation:
In this code, the spread operator is used to convert the set to an array, and then the sort function is used to sort the array in ascending order. The spread operator ensures that the elements of the set are not duplicated when converting back to an array.
