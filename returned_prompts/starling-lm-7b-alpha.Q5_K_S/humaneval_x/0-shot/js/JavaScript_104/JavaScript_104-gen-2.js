To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Define a function called `uniqueDigits` that takes an array of positive integers (`x`) as an input.
2. Inside the `uniqueDigits` function, initialize an empty array called `result` to store the sorted elements without any even digits.
3. Use a `for` loop to iterate over each element in the input array (`x`).
4. For each element, check if it has any even digit using the `hasEvenDigit` function. If it does, skip to the next iteration using the `continue` statement.
5. If the element does not have any even digit, check if the `result` array is empty or if the last element in the `result` array is greater than the current element. If either condition is true, push the current element to the `result` array.
6. After iterating through all the elements in the input array, return the sorted `result` array.
7. Define a helper function called `hasEvenDigit` that takes a number (`n`) as an input.
8. Inside the `hasEvenDigit` function, initialize a boolean variable called `evenDigit` to `false`.
9. Use a `while` loop to iterate until the number becomes zero. Inside the loop, check if the number is divisible by 2 (i.e., if it has an even digit). If it is
