To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Define a function called `vowelsCount` that takes a string `s` as input.
2. Create an array called `vowels` that contains all the vowel characters. In this case, the vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', and 'y'.
3. Initialize a variable `count` to 0, which will keep track of the number of vowels in the string.
4. Use a `for...of` loop to iterate through each character `char` in the input string `s`.
5. Inside the loop, use the `includes` method to check if the current character `char` is present in the `vowels` array. If it is, increment the `count` variable by 1.
6. After the loop, return the final value of the `count` variable.
7. Finally, test the function with a few example inputs using `console.log` statements.

By following these steps, you can implement the `vowelsCount` function that takes a string as input and returns the number of vowels in the string.

Here is an example of how to use the `vowelsCount` function:

```javascript
console.log(vowelsCount("abcde")); // Output: 2
console.log(vowelsCount("ACEDY")); // Output: 3
```

In the first example, the input string "abcde" contains 2 vowels ('a' and 'e'), so the function returns 2.
In the second example, the input string "ACEDY" contains 3 vowels ('a', 'e', and 'y'), so the function returns 3.
