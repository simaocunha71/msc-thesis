const evens = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30];

if (x > y) {
  return -1;
}

for (let i = 0; i < evens.length; i++) {
  if (evens[i] >= x && evens[i] <= y) {
    return evens[i];
  }
}
return -1;
};

// Export the function
module.exports = chooseNum;

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Create an array called `evens` that contains all even integers from 2 to 50 (or any range you'd like).
2. Compare the input values `x` and `y` to make sure `x` is not greater than `y`. If `x` is greater than `y`, return -1, as there are no even numbers in the range `[x, y]`.
3. Iterate through the `evens` array using a for loop and find the even number that falls within the range `[x, y]` (inclusive). If such a number exists, return it. Otherwise, return -1.

Here's an example implementation of the `chooseNum` function:

```javascript
const chooseNum = (x, y) => {
  const evens = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30];

  if (x > y) {
    return -1;
  }

  for (let i = 0; i < evens.length; i++) {
    if (evens[i] >= x && evens[i] <= y) {
      return evens[i];
    }
  }
  return -1;
};
```

To test the function with different scenarios, you can add console.log statements
