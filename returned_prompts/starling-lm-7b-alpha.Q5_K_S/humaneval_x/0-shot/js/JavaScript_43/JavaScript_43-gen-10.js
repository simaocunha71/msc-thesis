To solve this problem, I will first sort the list and then iterate through the list. For each element, I will check if the element at the opposite end of the list is equal to the negative of the current element. If it is, it means we found a pair that sums to zero, so I will return true. Otherwise, I will continue to the next element until the end of the list. If I reach the end of the list and have not found a pair that sums to zero, I will return false.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Sort the list in ascending order. This is done using the `sort` method with a comparison function that sorts the elements in ascending order.
   Example: `l.sort((a, b) => a - b)`

2. Iterate through the sorted list using the `forEach` method.
   Example: `l.forEach((element, index) => { ... })`

3. Inside the iteration, check if the element at the opposite end of the list is equal to the negative of the current element. This is done using the `index` and `l.length` variables.
   Example: `if (element === -l[l.length - index - 1]) { ... }`

4. If a pair that sums to zero is found, return true.
   Example: `return true`

5. If no pair that sums to zero is found after iterating through the entire list, return false.
   Example: `return false`

By following these steps, the `pairsSumToZero` function will return true if there are two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and false otherwise.

Here is the step-by-step solution in Python:

```python
def pairsSumToZero(l):
    l.sort()
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if l[i] == -l[len(l) - i - 1]:
            return True
    return False
```

In this Python implementation, the `sort` method is used to sort the list in ascending order. The `range` function is used to iterate through the indices of the list, and the `len` function is used to get the length of the list.
