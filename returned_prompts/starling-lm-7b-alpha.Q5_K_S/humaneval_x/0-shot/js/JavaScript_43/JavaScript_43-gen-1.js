To solve this problem, we can use a hash table (or set) to keep track of the numbers we've seen. For each number in the array, we'll check if the set contains the negation of that number. If it does, then we've found a pair of distinct elements that sum to zero. Otherwise, we'll add the current number to the set.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. Create an empty set called seen to keep track of the numbers we've seen.
2. Iterate through the array using a for loop. For each number in the array, do the following:
   a. Check if the negation of the current number exists in the set. If it does, we've found a pair of distinct elements that sum to zero, so return true.
   b. If the negation of the current number doesn't exist in the set, add the current number to the set.
3. If we've iterated through the entire array without finding a pair of distinct elements that sum to zero, return false.

Here's the code implementation of the solution:

```javascript
const pairsSumToZero = (l) => {
  const seen = new Set();

  for (let num of l) {
    if (seen.has(-num)) {
      return true;
    }
    seen.add(num);
  }

  return false;
};
```

You can test the function with the provided test cases:

```javascript
console.log(pairsSumToZero([1, 3, 5, 0])); // false
console.log(pairsSumToZero([1, 3, -2, 1])); // false
console.log(pairsSumToZero([1, 2, 3, 7])); // false
console.log(pairsSumToZero([2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7])); // true
console.log(pairsSumToZero([1])); // false
```

The function will return true if there are two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and false otherwise.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n),
