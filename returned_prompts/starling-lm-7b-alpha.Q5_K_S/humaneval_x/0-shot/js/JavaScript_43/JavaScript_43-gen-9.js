To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the list and check every pair of elements to see if their sum is equal to zero.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. Initialize a Set called seen to keep track of the elements we've seen. This will help us quickly check if an element has already been seen or not.
2. Iterate through the input list using a for loop. For each element, check if the negation of the element is in the seen set. If it is, it means we've found a pair of elements that sum to zero. In this case, return true.
3. If the loop finishes without finding any pair of elements that sum to zero, return false.

Here's the code implementation of the solution:

```python
def pairsSumToZero(l):
    seen = set()
    for elem in l:
        if -elem in seen:
            return True
        seen.add(elem)
    return False
```

You can test the function with the provided test cases to verify its correctness:

```python
print(pairsSumToZero([1, 3, 5, 0]))  # False
print(pairsSumToZero([1, 3, -2, 1]))  # False
print(pairsSumToZero([1, 2, 3, 7]))  # False
print(pairsSumToZero([2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7]))  # True
print(pairsSumToZero([1]))  # False
```

The function pairsSumToZero takes a list of integers as an input and returns true if there are two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and false otherwise.

For example, given the input [1, 3, 5, 0], the function will return false because there are no two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero. Given the input [1, 3, -2, 1], the function will still return false for the same reason. Given the input [1, 2, 3, 7], the function will return false because there are no two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero. Given the input [2, 4
