To solve this problem, you can use a set to keep track of the numbers that you have seen so far. For each number, you can check if the set contains the negation of that number. If it does, that means you have found two distinct elements that sum to zero. If it doesn't, you can add the number to the set.

Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. Create an empty set called seen to keep track of the numbers that have been seen so far.

2. Iterate through the input list l:
   a. For each number num in the list:
      i. Check if -num is in the seen set. If it is, that means we have found two distinct elements that sum to zero, so return true.
      ii. If -num is not in the seen set, add num to the seen set.

3. If you finish iterating through the entire list without finding two distinct elements that sum to zero, return false.

Here's the code to implement the above explanation:

```javascript
const pairsSumToZero = (l) => {
  const seen = new Set();

  for (const num of l) {
    if (seen.has(-num)) {
      return true;
    }
    seen.add(num);
  }

  return false;
};
```

You can test the function using the provided test cases:

```javascript
console.log(pairsSumToZero([1, 3, 5, 0])); // false
console.log(pairsSumToZero([1, 3, -2, 1])); // false
console.log(pairsSumToZero([1, 2, 3, 7])); // false
console.log(pairsSumToZero([2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7])); // true
console.log(pairsSumToZero([1])); // false
```

The function will return true if there are two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and false otherwise.

const pairsSumToZero = (l) => {
  const seen = new Set();

  for (const num of l) {
    if (seen.has(-num
