To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Check if n is greater than m. If it is, return -1.
2. Calculate the average of n and m by adding them together and dividing by 2.
3. Round the average to the nearest integer using Math.round().
4. Convert the rounded average to binary using the toString(2) method.
5. Return the binary representation of the rounded average.

Here's an example implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
const roundedAvg = (n, m) => {
  if (n > m) {
    return -1;
  }
  const average = (n + m) / 2;
  const roundedAverage = Math.round(average);
  return roundedAverage.toString(2);
};
```

This implementation first checks if n is greater than m. If it is, it returns -1. Otherwise, it calculates the average of n and m by adding them together and dividing by 2. The average is then rounded to the nearest integer using Math.round(). Finally, the rounded average is converted to binary using the toString(2) method, and the result is returned.

For example, if we call roundedAvg(1, 5), the function will return -1 because 1 is greater than 5. If we call roundedAvg(7, 5), the function will return "0b11" because the average of 7 and 5 is 6, and 6 in binary is "0b11".

Note that the result is returned as a string in binary format, prefixed with "0b".

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.
