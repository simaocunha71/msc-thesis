To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Check if `n` is greater than `m`. If it is, return -1, as the average cannot be computed.
2. Calculate the average of `n` and `m`.
3. Convert the average to binary and round it to the nearest integer.
4. Return the binary representation of the rounded average, prefixed with "0b".

Here's the code to implement this solution:

```javascript
const roundedAvg = (n, m) => {
  if (n > m) {
    return -1;
  }
  const avg = (n + m) / 2;
  const binary = avg.toString(2);
  const rounded = Math.round(avg).toString(2);
  return `0b${rounded}`;
};
```

You can use the `roundedAvg` function to compute the rounded average of two positive integers and return the binary representation of the result.

For example, if you call `roundedAvg(10, 20)`, it will return `"0b1111"`.

Note that the `toString(2)` method converts a number to its binary representation, and the `Math.round()` function rounds a number to the nearest whole number.

Make sure to test the function with various inputs to ensure it works correctly.

Happy coding!
