To solve this Kata, you need to follow the steps below:

1. Check if `n` is greater than `m`. If `n` is greater than `m`, return `-1`.
2. Calculate the average of `n` and `m`.
3. Convert the average to binary and round it to the nearest integer.
4. Return the binary representation of the rounded average.

Here's the code to implement the solution:

```javascript
function roundedAvg(n, m) {
  // Step 1: Check if n is greater than m
  if (n > m) {
    return -1;
  }

  // Step 2: Calculate the average of n and m
  const avg = (n + m) / 2;

  // Step 3: Convert the average to binary and round it to the nearest integer
  const roundedAvgBinary = Math.round(avg).toString(2);

  // Step 4: Return the binary representation of the rounded average
  return `0b${roundedAvgBinary}`;
}
```

You can test the function using the provided examples:

```javascript
console.log(roundedAvg(1, 5)); // "0b11"
console.log(roundedAvg(7, 5)); // -1
console.log(roundedAvg(10, 20)); // "0b1111"
console.log(roundedAvg(20, 33)); // "0b11010"
```

This will output the binary representation of the rounded average for each test case.

Note: The `Math.round()` function is used to round the average to the nearest integer, and the `toString(2)` function is used to convert the rounded average to binary. The `"0b"` prefix is added to the binary representation to indicate that it is a binary number.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

Answer:
In this problem, you are asked to compute the average of the integers from `n` through `m` (including `n` and `m`). If `n` is greater than `m`, you
