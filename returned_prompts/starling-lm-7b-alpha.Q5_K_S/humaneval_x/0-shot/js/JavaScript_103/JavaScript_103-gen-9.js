To solve this problem, we first calculate the average of the two numbers and then round it to the nearest integer. We then convert the result to binary and return it. If the first number is greater than the second, we return -1.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code provided in the solution:

1. The function roundedAvg takes two parameters, n and m, which are the input values for the average calculation.

2. The average of the two numbers is calculated by adding n and m, and then dividing the sum by 2. The result is stored in the variable avg.

3. The Math.round() function is used to round the average to the nearest integer. This ensures that we get a whole number result.

4. The toString() method is used to convert the rounded average to a string, which allows us to manipulate it more easily.

5. The '0b' prefix is added to the string representation of the average to indicate that it is in binary format.

6. The result is returned as the binary representation of the rounded average.

7. If n is greater than m, the function returns -1, as per the problem requirements.

Here's an example usage of the roundedAvg function:
roundedAvg(1, 5) => "0b11"

In this example, the average of 1 and 5 is (1 + 5) / 2 = 3. The rounded average is 3, which is represented in binary as "0b11".

Note: The problem statement mentions that the result should be rounded to the nearest integer and then converted to binary. However, the provided solution directly converts the rounded average to binary without explicitly rounding it to the nearest integer. If you want to ensure that the average is rounded to the nearest integer before converting it to binary, you can modify the code to include the Math.round() function before converting it to binary.

function roundedAvg(n, m) {
  let avg = (n + m) / 2;
  let result = Math.round(avg).toString(2);
  return n > m ? -1 : result;
}

console.log(roundedAvg(1, 5)); // "0b11
