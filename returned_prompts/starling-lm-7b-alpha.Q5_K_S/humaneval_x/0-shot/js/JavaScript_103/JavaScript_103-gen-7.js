To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Check if n is greater than m. If it is, return -1.
2. Calculate the average of the integers from n to m, including n and m.
3. Round the average to the nearest integer.
4. Convert the rounded integer to binary.
5. Return the binary representation of the rounded average.

Here's the code to implement the solution:

```javascript
const roundedAvg = (n, m) => {
  // Check if n is greater than m
  if (n > m) {
    return -1;
  }

  // Calculate the average of the integers from n to m
  const average = (n + m) / 2;

  // Round the average to the nearest integer
  const roundedAverage = Math.round(average);

  // Convert the rounded integer to binary
  const binaryAverage = roundedAverage.toString(2);

  // Return the binary representation of the rounded average
  return `0b${binaryAverage}`;
};
```

You can use the provided example test cases to verify the correctness of your implementation.
