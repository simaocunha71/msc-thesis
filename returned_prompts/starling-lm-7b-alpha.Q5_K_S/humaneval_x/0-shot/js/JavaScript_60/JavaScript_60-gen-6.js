The provided code is a JavaScript function called `sumToN` that takes a single parameter `n`. This function calculates and returns the sum of all numbers from 1 to `n`.

To understand how the function works, let's break down the code:

1. The function takes a parameter `n`, which represents the upper limit of the range of numbers to be summed.
2. The function uses a mathematical formula to calculate the sum of the first `n` positive integers. This formula is given by the arithmetic series formula: `n * (n + 1) / 2`.
3. The calculated sum is then returned by the function.

For example, if we call `sumToN(30)`, the function will calculate and return `465`, which is the sum of the numbers from 1 to 30. Similarly, `sumToN(100)` will return `5050`, and so on.

Overall, the `sumToN` function provides a convenient and efficient way to calculate the sum of the first `n` positive integers in JavaScript.

In terms of time complexity, this function has a time complexity of O(1) because it uses a mathematical formula to calculate the sum directly without iterating through the range of numbers.

As for space complexity, it is also O(1) because the function does not use any additional space that scales with the size of the input. It simply uses a constant amount of space to store the result and perform the calculation.

It's worth noting that this function assumes that the input `n` is a positive integer. If a non-integer value is passed, it may result in unexpected behavior or an error.

In summary, the `sumToN` function efficiently calculates and returns the sum of the first `n` positive integers using a mathematical formula, with a time complexity of O(1) and a space complexity of O(1).
