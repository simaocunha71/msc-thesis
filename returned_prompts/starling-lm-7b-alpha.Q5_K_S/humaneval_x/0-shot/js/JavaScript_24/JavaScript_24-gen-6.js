The solution is to loop from the largest divisor down to 1 and check if it is a divisor. This can be done using the modulo operator, which gives the remainder of the division. If the remainder is 0, the number is a divisor. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Create an empty array called 'divisors' to store the divisors of the given number 'n'.
2. Use a for loop starting from 'n' and going down to 1. For each number in the range, check if it is a divisor of 'n' by using the modulo operator (%). If the remainder is 0, it means the number is a divisor and should be added to the 'divisors' array.
3. After the loop, the 'divisors' array should now contain all the divisors of 'n'. The largest number in the array is the largest divisor of 'n'.
4. Return this largest divisor from the function.

Here is the code that implements this solution:

```python
def largestDivisor(n):
    divisors = []  # Step 1: Create an empty array to store the divisors of n.
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):  # Step 2: Loop from the largest divisor down to 1.
        if n % i == 0:  # Step 2: Check if i is a divisor of n using the modulo operator.
            divisors.append(i)  # Step 2: If i is a divisor, add it to the divisors array.
    return divisors[-1]  # Step 4: Return the largest divisor from the divisors array.
```

You can use this function to find the largest divisor of any given number 'n' by calling `largestDivisor(n)`. For example, if you call `largestDivisor(15)`, it will return 5, as 5 is the largest number that divides 15 evenly, smaller than 15.

In terms of time complexity, the function has a time complexity of O(√n) because the maximum divisor of n is always less than or equal to √n. The function loops through all the numbers
