In the given code, the `fixSpaces` function takes a `text` parameter, which is the input string that needs to be processed. The function uses a regular expression (`/\s+/g`) to match one or more consecutive spaces in the string. The `replace` method is then used to replace all matches with a hyphen (`'-'`).

The `regex` variable holds the regular expression pattern that matches one or more consecutive spaces. The `g` flag at the end of the pattern indicates that all matches should be replaced, not just the first one.

The `result` variable holds the modified string after applying the `replace` method. The modified string has all consecutive spaces replaced with hyphens.

Finally, the modified string is returned as the result of the function.

Explanation of the code:

1. The `fixSpaces` function takes a `text` parameter, which is the input string that needs to be processed.
2. The `regex` variable is assigned a regular expression pattern that matches one or more consecutive spaces (`\s+`).
3. The `result` variable is assigned the result of applying the `replace` method to the `text` string. The `replace` method replaces all matches of the `regex` pattern with a hyphen (`'-'`).
4. The modified string, with all consecutive spaces replaced with hyphens, is returned as the result of the function.

Explanation of the example test cases:

1. `fixSpaces("Example")` returns "Example" because there are no spaces in the input string.
2. `fixSpaces("Example 1")` returns "Example_1" because there is one space between "Example" and "1".
3. `fixSpaces(" Example 2")` returns "_Example_2" because there is one space at the beginning of the string and one space between "Example
