/*
The function takes a number as an argument and returns true if the number is the result of the multiplication of three prime numbers. It returns false otherwise.

In the function, an array called "primes" is defined with the first 29 prime numbers. The function filters the "primes" array to find the prime factors of the given number "a". The length of the "primeCandidates" array is checked to ensure that there are exactly three prime factors. If there are not, the function returns false.

If there are exactly three prime factors, the function assigns them to separate variables p1, p2, and p3. It then checks if the number "a" divided by p1 is divisible by p2, and if the result divided by p2 is divisible by p3. If both conditions are true, the function returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

The function is tested with the numbers 30 and 33, and the results are logged to the console.

The output of the function is:
true
false

Explanation:
The given function checks if a number is the multiplication of three prime numbers.
