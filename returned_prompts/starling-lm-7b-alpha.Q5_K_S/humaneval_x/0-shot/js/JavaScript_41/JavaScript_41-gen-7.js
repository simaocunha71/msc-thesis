The function `carRaceCollision` takes one argument, `n`, which represents the number of cars in each direction. This problem can be solved using the concept of symmetry. The number of collisions in one direction is equal to the number of collisions in the other direction. Therefore, we can simply calculate the number of collisions for one direction and return twice that value.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. Initialize a variable `collisions` to store the count of collisions. Set it to 0.

2. Use a `for` loop to iterate over each car in the left-to-right direction. Start from 1 and go up to `n`.

3. Inside the loop, increment the `collisions` variable by the index of the current car (`i`). This is because each car in the left-to-right direction will collide with the `i`th car in the right-to-left direction.

4. After the loop, double the value of `collisions` and return it. This accounts for the collisions in the right-to-left direction.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), as we iterate over each car in the left-to-right direction. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a single variable to store the count of collisions.

Here's the code for the solution:

```javascript
const carRaceCollision = (n) => {
  let collisions = 0;

  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    collisions += i;
  }

  return collisions * 2;
};
```

This function will return the total number of collisions between the two sets of cars, given the number of cars in each set.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), as we iterate over each car in the left-to-right direction. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a single variable to store the count of collisions.

Here's the code for the solution:

```javascript
const carRaceCollision = (n) => {
  let collisions = 0;

  for (let i = 1; i
