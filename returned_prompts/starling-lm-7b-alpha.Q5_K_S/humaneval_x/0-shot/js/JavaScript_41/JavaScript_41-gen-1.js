Here's one way to solve this problem:

The key is to think of this as a game of tic tac toe, but with n vs n players.

Since all cars are moving at the same speed, they are like pieces on a game board.
We can think of each car as a piece in the game of tic tac toe, and the game board is the road.

The left-to-right car is player X, and the right-to-left car is player O.

We can think of the game board as having a size of n x n.

To determine the number of collisions, we need to count the number of times player X and player O both have a piece on the same spot on the board.

To do this, we can use a nested loop to iterate over the game board and check if player X and player O have a piece on the same spot.

Here's an example implementation of the carRaceCollision function:
```javascript
function carRaceCollision(n) {
  let collisions = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      if (i === j) {
        collisions++;
      }
    }
  }
  return collisions;
}
```
In this implementation, we initialize a variable `collisions` to keep track of the number of collisions. We then use a nested loop to iterate over the game board and check if player X and player O have a piece on the same spot. If they do, we increment the `collisions` variable. Finally, we return the total number of collisions.

Note that this solution assumes that the game board is square and has a size of `n` x `n`.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.

*/

// O(n^2) time | O(1) space
const carRaceCollision = (n) => {
  // Using the formula for the sum of squares, we can calculate the total number of collisions
  return (n * (n + 1)) / 2;
};

carRaceCollision(3);
