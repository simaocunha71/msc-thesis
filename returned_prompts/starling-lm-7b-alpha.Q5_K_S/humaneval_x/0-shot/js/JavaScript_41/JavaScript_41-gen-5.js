To solve this problem we need to understand that the cars are moving at the same speed. Let's denote the speed of the car as v and the time as t. The distance each car travels is given by the formula d = vt.

The time it takes for the left to right car to reach a distance d is t = d / v. Similarly, the time it takes for the right to left car to reach a distance d is also t = d / v.

Since both cars travel the same speed and distance, they will collide at the same time.

However, since the cars are infinite in number and moving in opposite directions, there will be an infinite number of collisions.

To calculate the number of collisions, we can use the formula n * (n + 1) / 2. This formula is derived from the arithmetic series, where the first term is 1, the last term is n + 1, and the common difference is 1.

Here's the code that implements this logic:

```javascript
function carRaceCollision(n) {
  return n * (n + 1) / 2;
}
```

In this code, the function `carRaceCollision` takes an argument `n` which represents the number of cars moving in each direction. It returns the number of collisions as calculated by the formula n * (n + 1) / 2.

For example, if we call `carRaceCollision(5)`, it will return 15, which represents the number of collisions between 5 cars moving left to right and 5 cars moving right to left.

It's important to note that this problem assumes an idealized scenario where the cars are infinitely strong and collisions don't affect their motion. In reality, collisions between cars can lead to damage and changes in their trajectory, but those details are not considered in this problem.

Additionally, the formula n * (n + 1) / 2 can be derived from a geometric series, where the first term is 1, the last term is n + 1, and the common ratio is 1. However, in this problem, the formula is derived from an arithmetic series, which is a more intuitive approach.

In summary, the `carRaceCollision
