The cars will never collide because they are moving in opposite directions and are infinitely strong. Here's a proof by contradiction:

Assume that the cars collide at some point. Since the cars are moving in opposite directions, both cars must be at the same location at the same time. However, since they are infinitely strong, they will continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide. This means that they cannot collide in the first place, which contradicts our assumption. Therefore, the cars will never collide.

Thus, the function `carRaceCollision` should return `0` because there are no collisions between the two sets of cars.

Here's an example implementation of the function in JavaScript:

```javascript
const carRaceCollision = (n) => {
  return 0;
};
```

This function takes an input `n` which represents the number of cars in each set. It then returns `0` to indicate that there are no collisions between the two sets of cars.

Keep in mind that this is a theoretical problem and doesn't have a practical application. It's more of a thought experiment to test your understanding of the concept of collisions and the behavior of objects in motion.

Additionally, note that this problem is independent of the number of cars in each set. The result will always be `0` regardless of the value of `n`.

I hope this helps clarify the concept! Let me know if you have any more questions.
