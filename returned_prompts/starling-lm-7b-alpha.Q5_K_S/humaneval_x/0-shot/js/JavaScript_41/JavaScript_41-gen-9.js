To solve this problem, you can use the following logic:

There are two sets of cars, one moving from left to right and the other moving from right to left. The cars in each set have the same speed and start at a distance that is infinite in either direction. Over time, the cars in the two sets will eventually meet and collide. However, because the cars are infinitely strong, they continue moving as if they did not collide.

To determine the number of collisions, you can use the formula n * n, where n is the number of cars in each set. This is because each car in the left-moving set can collide with each car in the right-moving set, and vice versa.

Therefore, the function can be implemented as follows:

```javascript
const carRaceCollision = (n) => {
  return n * n;
};
```

This function will return the number of collisions between the two sets of cars, which is equal to the square of the number of cars in each set.

For example, if there are 3 cars in each set, the function will return 9, as there are 9 possible collisions (3 cars in the left set can collide with 3 cars in the right set).

In summary, the carRaceCollision function calculates the number of collisions between the two sets of cars by multiplying the number of cars in each set by itself.

Hope this helps!

Here's a quick breakdown of the solution:

- The function carRaceCollision takes in a parameter n, which represents the number of cars in each set.
- It uses the formula n * n to calculate the number of collisions, as each car in the left-moving set can collide with each car in the right-moving set, and vice versa.
- The function then returns the calculated number of collisions.
- For example, if n is 3, the function will return 9, as there are 9 possible collisions (3 cars in the left set can collide with 3 cars in the right set).
- The logic behind this solution is that since the cars in each set have the same speed and start at a distance that is infinite in either direction, they will eventually meet and collide. However, because the cars are
