The function will return n.

Explanation:
The function carRaceCollision takes one argument, n, which represents the number of cars on the road. In this scenario, each car moving left to right is considered as one car and each car moving right to left is considered as another car. Since all the cars are moving in the same direction, there will never be a collision between the cars. Therefore, the function will return n, as there are n cars on the road, and all of them are moving in the same direction, resulting in no collisions.

Here's an example usage of the function:
console.log(carRaceCollision(5)); // Output: 5
In this example, the function carRaceCollision is called with the argument 5. As a result, it returns 5, indicating that there are 5 cars on the road, and since they are all moving in the same direction, there are no collisions.

This function is useful in situations where you need to simulate a car race or any other scenario involving multiple cars moving in opposite directions without colliding.
