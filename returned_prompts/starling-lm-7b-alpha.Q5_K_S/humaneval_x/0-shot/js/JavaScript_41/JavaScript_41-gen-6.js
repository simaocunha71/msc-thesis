Here is one way to think about this problem:

If we have 1 car moving left and 1 car moving right, they will always collide.
If we have 2 cars moving left and 2 cars moving right, they will never collide.
If we have 3 cars moving left and 3 cars moving right, they will always collide.

The number of collisions will always be equal to the number of cars moving left to right.

Here's the function, using this logic:

```
function carRaceCollision(n) {
  return n;
}
```

In this function, we don't actually need to use a loop to calculate the result; we can just return the value of `n`.

This is because, no matter how many cars are moving left to right and no matter how many cars are moving right to left, the result will always be equal to the number of cars moving left to right. This is because the cars are moving in opposite directions and they don't interact with each other.

This function will return the number of collisions between the two sets of cars, given the total number of cars (n) in the race.

As an example, if there are 5 cars moving left to right and 5 cars moving right to left, the function will return 5, because there will be 5 collisions.

This function is a simple mathematical solution to the problem, and it works for any value of `n`.

Note that this is a simplified version of the problem, and in real life, cars and other objects can interact with each other in more complex ways. But for the purposes of this problem, this solution is correct.

As an additional note, it's worth mentioning that this problem is an example of a classic problem in computer science and mathematics known as the "two streams of cars" problem. It's a simple but elegant problem that illustrates some fundamental concepts in computer science and mathematics.

Here's another way to think about the problem:

Imagine you have two streams of cars, one moving left and one moving right. Each car in the left stream is going to collide with a car in the right stream at some point. So, the number of collisions is equal to the number of cars in the left stream.
