To solve this problem we can use the following logic:

- For each car in the left to right set, it will collide with exactly half of the right to left cars.
- Since every car in the left to right set will collide with some car in the right to left set, and vice versa,
- We can think of this as a binary tree where each node is a car, and each collision is a branch in the tree.
- At the root of the tree, we have `n` left to right cars and `n` right to left cars.
- Each collision creates two new branches, one for each car that collided.
- Therefore, the total number of collisions is equal to the total number of nodes in the tree.

For example, let's consider a simple case where `n = 3`. We can visualize the tree as follows:

```
         1
       /   \
      /     \
     2       3
    / \     / \
   4   5   6   7
  / \
 8   9
```

In this case, there are `2^8 = 256` nodes in the tree, which means there are `256` collisions.

In general, the number of nodes in a complete binary tree of height `h` is `2^(h+1)`.
In this problem, the height of the tree is equal to the total number of cars, which is `2n`.

Therefore, the number of collisions is `2^(2n + 1) - 1`.

Here is the JavaScript implementation of the above logic:

```javascript
function carRaceCollision(n) {
  return (2 ** (2 * n + 1)) - 1;
}
```

The time complexity of this function is `O(1)` because the calculation does not depend on the input size.

The space complexity is also `O(1)` as the function only uses a fixed number of variables regardless of the input size.

Here are some test cases for this function:

```javascript
console.log(carRaceCollision(1)); // 3
console.log(carRaceCollision(2)); // 15
console.log
