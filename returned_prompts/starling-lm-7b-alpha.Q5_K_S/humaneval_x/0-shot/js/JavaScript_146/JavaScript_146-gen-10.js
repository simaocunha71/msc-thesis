*/

In this code, a function called specialFilter is defined, which takes an array of numbers as input and returns the number of elements in the array that are greater than 10 and both the first and last digits of a number are odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9). 

The function initializes a variable count to 0, which will keep track of the number of elements that meet the criteria. 

Then, a for loop is used to iterate through each element in the input array. For each element, the firstDigit and lastDigit variables are assigned the first and last digits of the number, respectively, by converting the number to a string and accessing the appropriate indices. 

The if statement checks if the element is greater than 10 and if both the first and last digits are odd (not divisible by 2). If these conditions are met, the count is incremented by 1. 

Finally, the function returns the count, which represents the number of elements in the input array that satisfy the criteria.

The code includes two example calls to the specialFilter function, with the expected output printed using console.log. 

In the first example, the input array [15, -73, 14, -15] is passed to the specialFilter function, which returns 1 since the number 15 is greater than 10 and both the first and last digits (1 and 5) are odd.
