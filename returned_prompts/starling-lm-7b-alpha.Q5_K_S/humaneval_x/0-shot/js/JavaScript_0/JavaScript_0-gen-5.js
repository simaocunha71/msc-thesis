To solve this problem we need to iterate through the array and compare each element to every other element in the array. If the absolute difference between two elements is less than or equal to the threshold, we return true. Otherwise, we continue to the next pair of elements. If we reach the end of the array without finding any two elements within the threshold, we return false. Here's the code:

```python
def hasCloseElements(numbers, threshold):
  for i in range(len(numbers)):
    for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)):
      if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) <= threshold:
        return True
  return False
```

This function will return True if there are any two elements within the threshold distance of each other, and False if there are no such elements.

For example, if we call `hasCloseElements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)`, the function will return False, because the closest two elements are 1.0 and 2.0, which are 0.5 apart. However, if we call `hasCloseElements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)`, the function will return True, because the closest two elements are 2.0 and 2.8, which are 0.3 apart.

Here's a breakdown of how the function works:

1. We start by defining a function called `hasCloseElements` that takes in two parameters: `numbers`, which is the list of numbers to check, and `threshold`, which is the maximum distance allowed between two elements.

2. Inside the function, we use a nested loop to compare each element in the list to every other element. The outer loop iterates through each element, and the inner loop starts at the next element after the current one. This ensures that we don't compare an element to itself or to the element before it.

3. In the inner loop, we calculate the absolute difference between the current element (`numbers[i]`) and the next element (`numbers[j]`). If this difference is less than or equal to the threshold, we return True, as this means we have
