To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Sort the given numbers in ascending order.
2. Iterate through the sorted array, comparing each pair of adjacent numbers. If the absolute difference between two numbers is less than or equal to the threshold, return true. If the end of the array is reached, and no pair of numbers has been found to be closer than the threshold, return false.

Here is an implementation of this approach:
