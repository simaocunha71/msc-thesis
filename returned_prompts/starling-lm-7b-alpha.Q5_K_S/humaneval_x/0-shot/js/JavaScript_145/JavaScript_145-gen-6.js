Here's one possible implementation for the `orderByPoints` function:

```javascript
const orderByPoints = (nums) => {
  return nums.sort((a, b) => {
    const sumA = a.toString().split('').reduce((sum, digit) => sum + +digit, 0);
    const sumB = b.toString().split('').reduce((sum, digit) => sum + +digit, 0);

    if (sumA === sumB) {
      return a - b;
    } else {
      return sumA - sumB;
    }
  });
};
```

This function first calculates the sum of the digits for each number in the array. It does this by converting the number to a string, splitting the string into an array of digits, using `reduce` to sum all the digits together, and then converting the sum back to a number. The sums are then compared to determine the order of the numbers.

If the sums are equal, the function falls back to comparing the original indices of the numbers in the array to determine the order.

Finally, the function uses the `sort` method with a comparator function to sort the array based on the calculated values.

The time complexity of this function is O(n log n), where n is the length of the input array, due to the `sort` method. The space complexity is O(n), as the function creates a new array to store the sorted numbers.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. The `orderByPoints` function takes an array of numbers as input.
2. Inside the function, the `sort` method is used on the input array. The `sort` method takes a comparator function as an argument, which is used to determine the order of the elements in the array.
3. The comparator function takes two numbers (`a` and `b`) as input.
4. The sum of the digits of each number is calculated using the `reduce` method. The `reduce` method is used to iterate over the digits of each number (converted to an array of strings), add them together, and return the
