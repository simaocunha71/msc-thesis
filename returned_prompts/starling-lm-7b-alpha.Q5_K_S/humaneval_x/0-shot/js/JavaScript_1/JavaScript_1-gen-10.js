To solve this problem, I would start by defining a function called `separateParenGroups` that takes in a single parameter called `paren_string`. This parameter will be the string that contains multiple groups of nested parentheses.

Next, I would initialize an empty array called `groups` to store the separate groups of balanced parentheses. 

Then, I would initialize a variable called `index` to 0. This variable will be used to keep track of the current index in the `paren_string` array.

After that, I would create a while loop that will continue until the `index` variable is less than the length of the `paren_string` array. This loop will iterate through the `paren_string` array and check for balanced parentheses.

Inside the loop, I would check if the current character at the `index` is an opening parenthesis '('. If it is, I would increment the `index` variable by 1 and enter another while loop.

Inside the nested while loop, I would check if the current character at the `index` is a closing parenthesis ')'. If it is, I would check if the count of opening parentheses is greater than 0. If it is, I would decrement the count by 1 and increment the `index` variable by 1. If the count is not greater than 0, it means that there is an unbalanced parenthesis, so I would return an empty array to indicate an error.

If the current character at the `index` is not a closing parenthesis, I would increment the `index` variable by 1 and continue checking for balanced parentheses.

After the while loop ends, I would check if the count of opening parentheses is greater than 0. If it is, it means that there are unbalanced parentheses, so I would return an empty array to indicate an error.

If the count of opening parentheses is 0, it means that all the balanced parentheses have been separated. I would then use the `slice` method to extract the balanced group of parentheses from the `paren_string` array and add it to the `groups` array.

Finally, I would return the `groups` array, which will contain all the separate groups of balanced parentheses.

Here is the code for the `separ
