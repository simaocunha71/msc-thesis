To solve this problem we will follow these steps:

1. Initialize a stack with a capacity of paren_string.length + 1. This will be used to store each individual set of parentheses. We add +1 to the capacity because we will be adding an additional closing brace to each set.
2. Initialize an empty result array to store all of the sets of parentheses.
3. Iterate through paren_string with a for loop. For each character, do the following:
    a. If the character is an opening brace '(', push the current set of parentheses onto the stack. This will include the opening brace itself and all of the characters until the next closing brace is found.
    b. If the character is a closing brace ')', pop the last set of parentheses from the stack. We know that the current set of parentheses is complete because we have found a closing brace that matches the most recent opening brace.
    c. If the character is a space, ignore it.
4. After the loop has finished, the stack will contain all of the incomplete sets of parentheses. We can return an error at this point because the stack is not empty.
5. Iterate through the stack with a for loop. For each set of parentheses, do the following:
    a. Create a new string that includes the opening and closing braces. The opening brace will be the one that was at the top of the stack when we first popped it off. The closing brace will be the one that was at the top of the stack when we popped it off after popping all of the characters in between.
    b. Push the new string into the result array.
6. Return the result array.

Here is the JavaScript function that implements these steps:

```javascript
const separateParenGroups = (paren_string) => {
  let stack = [];
  let result = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < paren_string.length; i++) {
    let char = paren_string[i];

    if (char === '(') {
      stack.push(paren_string[i]);
    } else if (char === ')') {
      result.push(stack.pop() + char);
    } else if (char === ' ') {
