/*
The function takes an input string that is a combination of nested parentheses. It starts by splitting the string into an array of individual groups of parentheses. For each group, it initializes a counter to track the depth of nesting, starting at zero. It then enters a loop that continues until all characters in the group have been processed. In each iteration of the loop, it checks the first character in the group. If it is an opening parenthesis, it increments the counter and moves on to the next character in the group. If it is a closing parenthesis, it decrements the counter and moves on to the next character. It also compares the counter value at each step to the maximum value seen so far for the group, and updates the maximum value if necessary. Once all characters in the group have been processed, the counter value (i.e., the maximum nesting depth) is stored in the result array at the corresponding index. Finally, the result array is returned.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the total length of the input string. This is because, in the worst case, each character in the string needs to be processed once.

The space complexity of this function is O(1), as the size of the result array is constant, regardless of the size of the input string.

The function correctly solves the problem as stated in the prompt. It accurately determines the maximum nesting depth of parentheses within each group in the input string, and stores the result in an array.
