return (a % 10) * (b % 10);

};






/*

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. The function takes in two integers, a and b.
2. The modulo operator (%) is used to find the remainder when the dividend (a) is divided by the divisor (10). This gives us the unit digit of a, represented as (a % 10).
3. Similarly, the modulo operator is used to find the unit digit of b, represented as (b % 10).
4. The product of the unit digits of a and b is calculated by multiplying (a % 10) and (b % 10).
5. The result is returned as the output of the function.
