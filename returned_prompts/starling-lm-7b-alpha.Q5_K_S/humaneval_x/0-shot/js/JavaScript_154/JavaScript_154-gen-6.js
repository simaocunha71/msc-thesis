Answer: While loop is used in this solution.

Explanation:
In the cycpatternCheck function, we are comparing the first and second string to find if the second string is a substring of the first string or any of its rotations.
To accomplish this, we use a while loop that runs indefinitely until a condition is met.
Inside the loop, we use the indexOf() method to find the index of the second string in the first string.
If the indexOf() returns -1, it means that the second string is not found in the first string. In this case, we return false.
If the index is 0 or if the length of the first string is greater than the length of the second string and the index plus the length of the second string minus 1 is equal to the length of the first string, it means that the second string is a substring of the first string or any of its rotations. In this case, we return true.
If neither of these conditions is met, we update the value of the first string by taking a substring of it starting from the second character and appending the first character at the end. This is done to rotate the first string.
The loop continues until one of the conditions is met.

In the given solution, the while loop is used to continuously check if the second string is a substring of the first string or any of its rotations. The loop runs indefinitely until the condition is met, and the first string is updated by rotating it to check for the condition again.

This approach ensures that all possible rotations of the second string are checked, and the correct result is returned.

Overall, the while loop is a crucial part of the solution, as it allows for the continuous checking and rotation of the first string to find the substring in it.
