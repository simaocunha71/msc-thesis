To determine if a number is prime, we can start by checking if the number is divisible by 2 or 3. If it is, it is not prime. To check if a number is divisible by 2, we can use the modulus operator (`%`) to check if the remainder of dividing the number by 2 is 0. To check if a number is divisible by 3, we can use the same method, but with 3 as the divisor. If the number is divisible by 2 or 3, we can return `false`, indicating that the number is not prime.

Next, we can check if the number is divisible by all odd numbers up to the square root of the number. We can do this by iterating through all odd numbers starting from 3 up to the square root of the number (inclusive). For each odd number, we can check if the number is divisible by that odd number using the modulus operator. If it is, we can return `false`, indicating that the number is not prime.

If the number is not divisible by 2, 3, or any of the odd numbers up to the square root of the number, then it is prime. In this case, we can return `true`.

Here's a Python implementation of the `isPrime` function:

```python
def isPrime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n == 2:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True
```

To use the function, you can simply call it with a number as the argument. It will return `True` if the number is prime, and `False` if it is not.

For example, to check if 6 is prime, you can call `isPrime(6)`. The function will return `False` because 6 is divisible by 2. Similarly, to check if 101 is prime, you can call `isPrime(101)`. The function will return
