/*
  The provided code defines a function called `checkIfLastCharIsALetter` that takes a string `txt` as an input. The function uses the `split` method to split the `txt` into an array of words, and then uses the `pop` method to get the last word from the array.

  The function then checks if the last word is not empty (i.e., it has at least one character) and if the last character of the last word is an alphabetical character. It uses the `match` method with a regular expression `/[a-zA-Z]/` to check if the last character is an alphabetical character.

  If the condition is true, the function returns `true`, indicating that the last character of the input string is an alphabetical character and is not a part of a word. Otherwise, it returns `false`.
