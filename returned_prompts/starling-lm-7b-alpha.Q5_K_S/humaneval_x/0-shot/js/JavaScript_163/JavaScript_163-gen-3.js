To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Create an empty array called `arr` to store the even digits.
2. Use a for loop to iterate through the numbers from `a` to `b`.
3. Convert each number to a string using the `toString()` method and store it in a variable called `str`.
4. Use another for loop to iterate through each digit in the `str` variable.
5. Check if the current digit is even by using the modulo operator `%` with 2. If the remainder is 0, it means the digit is even.
6. If the current digit is even, convert it back to a number using the `Number()` function and push it to the `arr` array.
7. After the loops are finished, sort the `arr` array in ascending order using the `sort()` method with a comparison function `(a, b) => a - b`.
8. Finally, return the sorted `arr` array as the result.

Here's an example of how you can use the `generateIntegers` function with different inputs:

console.log(generateIntegers(2, 8)); // [2, 4, 6, 8]
console.log(generateIntegers(8, 2)); // [2, 4, 6, 8]
console.log(generateIntegers(10, 14)); // []

The first example will return `[2, 4
