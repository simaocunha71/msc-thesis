288

Explanation:

The code defines a function called `specialFactorial` that calculates the Brazilian factorial of an integer `n`. The Brazilian factorial is defined as `n! * (n-1)! * (n-2)! * ... * 1!`, where `n > 0`. The function uses a recursive approach to calculate the factorial by multiplying `n` with the factorial of `n-1`. If `n` is 0 or 1, the function returns 1, as these are the base cases for the factorial.

The code then calls the `specialFactorial` function with the argument 4 and logs the result to the console. According to the definition of the Brazilian factorial, when `n` is 4, the factorial is calculated as `4! * 3! * 2! * 1!`, which equals 288. Therefore, the output of the code is 288.

The code demonstrates the usage of recursion to calculate factorials efficiently, as each recursive call reduces the value of `n` by 1 until it reaches the base case.

In summary, the output of the code is 288, as the `specialFactorial` function correctly calculates the Brazilian factorial of 4.
