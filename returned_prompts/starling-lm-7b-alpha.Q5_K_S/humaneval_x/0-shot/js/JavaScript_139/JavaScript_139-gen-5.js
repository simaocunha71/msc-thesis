The Brazilian factorial is defined as:
  brazilian_factorial(n) = n! * (n-1)! * (n-2)! * ... * 1!
  where n > 0

  For example:
  >>> specialFactorial(4)
  288

  The function will receive an integer as input and should return the special
  factorial of this integer.


The Brazilian factorial is defined as:
  brazilian_factorial(n) = n! * (n-1)! * (n-2)! * ... * 1!
  where n > 0

  For example:
  >>> specialFactorial(4)
  288

  The function will receive an integer as input and should return the special
  factorial of this integer.

Here is a solution to the problem:

```python
def special_factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

This code defines a function called `special_factorial` that takes an integer `n` as input. It initializes a variable `result` to 1. Then it enters a loop that starts from 1 and goes up to `n+1`. In each iteration of the loop, it multiplies the current value of `result` by the loop variable `i` and assigns the result back to `result`. After the loop is finished, it returns the final value of `result`.

This code calculates the Brazilian factorial of a number by iteratively multiplying all the numbers from 1 to `n`. The result is stored in the variable `result` and returned at the end of the function.

You can test the function with the given example `special_factorial(4)` and it should return `288`.

```python
print(special_factorial(4))  # Output: 288
```
