/*
In this task, we are asked to define a function that calculates the Brazilian factorial of an input number. The Brazilian factorial is obtained by multiplying all the numbers from 1 to n, including n.

To solve this problem, we can start by defining a function called specialFactorial that takes an integer n as input and returns the Brazilian factorial of n. We can then initialize a variable result to 1, which will store the result of the factorial.

Next, we can use a for loop to iterate from 1 to n. In each iteration, we multiply the current value of result by the loop counter i. This way, we calculate the factorial of n by multiplying all the numbers from 1 to n.

Finally, we return the result of the factorial calculation. If the input number is less than or equal to 0, we return a string indicating that the number must be greater than 0, as the factorial is not defined for non-positive integers.

By following these steps, we can define a function that calculates the Brazilian factorial of a given number.
