The code provided is a function named `startsOneEnds` that takes a positive integer `n` as input. The function aims to return the count of the numbers of `n`-digit positive integers that start or end with `1`. 

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of mathematical induction. According to the problem's constraints, we know that when `n = 1`, the answer is `2`. 

For `n > 1`, we can consider the first `n-1` digits of the number. These `n-1` digits can be filled in `10^(n-1)` ways, as each digit can take any value from `0` to `9`. 

Now, we have two cases to consider:
1. The first digit of the `n`-digit number is `1`. In this case, we have `1` option for the first digit, and the remaining `n-1` digits can be filled in `10^(n-1)` ways. Therefore, there are `1 * 10^(n-1)` numbers that start with `1`.
2. The first digit of the `n`-digit number is not `1`. In this case, we have `9` options for the first digit (since it cannot be `1`), and the remaining `n-1` digits can be filled in `10^(n-1)` ways. Therefore, there are `9 * 10^(n-1)` numbers that do not start with `1`.

To find the total count of numbers that start or end with `1`, we add the counts from both cases: `1 * 10^(n-1) + 9 * 10^(n-1)`. Simplifying this expression, we get `10 * 10^(n-1)`, which is equal to `10^n`. 

Therefore, the function returns `10^n` as the count of the numbers of `n`-digit positive integers that start or end with `1`. 

For example, if we call the function with `n = 3`, it will return `10^3 = 1000`, as there are 10
