The solution is to calculate the total number of 1-digit and 2-digit numbers,
and then use the fact that each subsequent digit will be 1/9th as likely to occur
as the previous digit.

This is a geometric series, and the formula to calculate the sum of the first N terms of a geometric series is:
sum = a * (r^n - 1) / (r - 1),
where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.

In this case, the first term a = 2 (because there are two 1-digit numbers, 1 and 10),
and the common ratio r = 1/9 (because each subsequent digit is 1/9th as likely to occur).

For the 2-digit numbers, the first term a = 18 (because there are 18 2-digit numbers),
and the common ratio r = 1/9 (because each subsequent digit is 1/9th as likely to occur).

To calculate the sum of the first n terms of a geometric series, we can use the formula:
sum = a * (r^n - 1) / (r - 1).

For the 1-digit numbers, the sum is:
sum = 2 * (1/9^1 - 1) / (1/9 - 1) = 2 * (1/9 - 1) / (-8/9) = 2 * (-1/9) / (-8/9) = 2 * (-1/9) * (-9/8) = -2/8 = -1/4.

For the 2-digit numbers, the sum is:
sum = 18 * (1/9^2 - 1) / (1/9 - 1) = 18 * (1/81 - 1) / (-80/81) = 18 * (-1/81) / (-80/81) = 18 * (-1/81) * (81/80) = -18/80.

The total sum is the sum of the 1-digit and 2-digit numbers, which is:
