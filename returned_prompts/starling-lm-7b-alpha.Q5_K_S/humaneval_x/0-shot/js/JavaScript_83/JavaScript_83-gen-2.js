The solution to this problem is to recognize that all n-digit numbers that
start or end with 1 are the same as all n-digit numbers that start with 1,
or all n-digit numbers that end with 1.

Here's one way to prove it:

1. Assume n = 0, and the number is 0. There is exactly 1 number, and it
starts and ends with 1, so the claim holds for this case.

2. Assume the claim is true for all n-digit numbers up to some n â‰¥ 1, and
consider an (n + 1)-digit number. If the first digit is 1, then there are
10 choices for the remaining digits. If the last digit is 1, then there are
10 choices for the first digit. In either case, the claim holds for the
(n + 1)-digit number as well.

The claim is true by induction, so the solution is to return 10^n.

Here's an example implementation of the above reasoning in JavaScript:

```
const startsOneEnds = n => {
  if (n === 0) return 1;
  return 10 ** n;
};
```

The time complexity of this function is O(1) and the space complexity is also O(1).

To test the function, you can use the following test cases:

```
console.log(startsOneEnds(0));  // 1
console.log(startsOneEnds(1));  // 10
console.log(startsOneEnds(2));  // 100
```

This should output:

```
1
10
100
```

This verifies that the function works correctly.

I hope this helps!
