const result = strings.filter(str => {
  return str.includes(substring);
});
return result;
};

The filterBySubstring function takes in two parameters:
- strings: an array of strings
- substring: the substring to filter by

The function uses the filter method on the strings array. This method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. In this case, the test is whether the string includes the substring or not. The test is implemented using the includes method on the string.

The function then returns the result array, which contains all the strings from the input array that include the substring.

In the provided example, the function is called with an empty array and the substring 'a', resulting in an empty array being returned. When called with the array ['abc', 'bacd', 'cde', 'array'] and the substring 'a', the function returns ['abc', 'bacd', 'array'], as these are the only strings in the array that include the substring 'a'.

Overall, the function filters an input list of strings only for ones that contain a given substring, and returns the filtered array.
