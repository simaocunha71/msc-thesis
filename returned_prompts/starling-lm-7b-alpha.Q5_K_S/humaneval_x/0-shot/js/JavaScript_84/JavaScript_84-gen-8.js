To solve this problem, we need to convert the decimal number N to binary, and then calculate the sum of its digits in binary.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to convert a decimal number to binary:

1. Initialize a variable 'binary' to store the binary number, and set it to 0.
2. While the decimal number N is greater than 0, do the following:
   a. Calculate the remainder of N divided by 2, and add it to the 'binary' variable.
   b. Divide N by 2, and update the value of N.
3. After the loop, the 'binary' variable will contain the binary representation of the decimal number N.

Once we have the binary representation of N, we can calculate the sum of its digits by iterating through each digit and adding it to a variable 'sum'. Finally, we can convert the decimal number 'sum' to binary and return the result.

Here's the code to solve the problem:

```javascript
const solve = (N) => {
  // Convert the decimal number N to binary
  let binary = 0;
  while (N > 0) {
    binary = 2 * binary + (N % 2);
    N = Math.floor(N / 2);
  }

  // Calculate the sum of the digits in the binary number
  let sum = 0;
  while (binary > 0) {
    sum += binary % 10;
    binary = Math.floor(binary / 10);
  }

  // Convert the decimal number 'sum' to binary and return the result
  return (sum).toString(2);
};
```

You can test the function with different inputs to see how it works.
