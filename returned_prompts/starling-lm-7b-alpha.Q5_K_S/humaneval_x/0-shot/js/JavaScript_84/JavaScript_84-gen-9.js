To solve this problem we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the sum of the digits of the number in decimal.
2. Convert the sum to binary and return it.

Let's start with step 1. To calculate the sum of the digits of the number N in decimal, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize a variable sum to 0.
2. Initialize a variable cur to N.
3. While cur is greater than 0, do the following:
   a. Calculate the remainder of cur divided by 10 and add it to sum.
   b. Divide cur by 10 to get the quotient.
4. Convert sum to binary and return it as a string.

Now, let's write the code to perform step 1:

```javascript
let sum = 0;
let cur = N;
while (cur > 0) {
  sum += cur % 10;
  cur = Math.floor(cur / 10);
}
```

Next, let's write the code to perform step 2, which is to convert sum to binary:

```javascript
function toBinary(num) {
  if (num === 0) {
    return '0';
  }
  let binary = '';
  while (num > 0) {
    binary = (num % 2) + binary;
    num = Math.floor(num / 2);
  }
  return binary;
}

let binarySum = toBinary(sum);
```

Finally, we can return binarySum as the output:

```javascript
return binarySum;
```

So, the complete function would look like this:

```javascript
const solve = (N) => {
  let sum = 0;
  let cur = N;
  while (cur > 0) {
    sum += cur % 10;
    cur = Math.floor(cur / 10);
  }
  let binarySum = toBinary(sum);
  return binarySum;
};
```

To test the function, you can use the following code:

```javascript
console.log(solve(1
