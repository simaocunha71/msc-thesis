/*

Here's the solution to the challenge:

We start by initializing a variable called sum to 0. This variable will store the sum of the even elements at odd indices.

Next, we use a for loop to iterate over the list. We start the loop at index 0 and increment the index by 2 in each iteration. This ensures that we only consider the even elements at odd indices.

Inside the loop, we add the value of the current element to the sum variable using the addition assignment operator (+=). This updates the sum with the current element.

Finally, we return the value of the sum variable, which is the result of adding all the even elements at odd indices.

To test the function, we call it with the example input [4, 2, 6, 7] and log the result to the console using console.log(). The expected output is 2, as the even elements at odd indices are 4 and 2, and their sum is 2.
