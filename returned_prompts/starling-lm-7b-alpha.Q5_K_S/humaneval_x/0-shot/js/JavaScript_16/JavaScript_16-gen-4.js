/*
Explanation:

The `countDistinctCharacters` function takes a string as an argument and converts it to lowercase using the `toLowerCase()` method. This is done to ensure that the distinct characters are not counted based on their case.

Next, a new Set is created from the lowercase string using the spread operator (`[...]`). A Set is a built-in JavaScript object that only contains unique values. By spreading the lowercase string into a Set, we automatically remove any duplicate characters.

Finally, the length of the distinct characters array is returned, which gives us the count of distinct characters in the original string.

To test the function, we can call it with different string arguments and print the result using `console.log()`. The expected outputs are shown in the comments next to each test case.
