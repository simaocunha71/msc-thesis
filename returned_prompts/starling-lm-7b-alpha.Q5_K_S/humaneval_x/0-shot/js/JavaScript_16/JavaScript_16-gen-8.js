The `countDistinctCharacters` function takes a string as an argument and performs the following steps:

1. It converts all characters in the string to lowercase using the `toLowerCase()` method. This step ensures that characters with different cases are treated as the same.
2. It creates a `Set` called `distinctCharacters` from the lowercase string. A `Set` is a collection of unique values, so any duplicate characters in the string are automatically removed.
3. It converts the `Set` back to an array using the `size` property and returns the length of the array. This gives the number of distinct characters in the string.

To test the function, you can use the provided test cases:

- `countDistinctCharacters('xyzXYZ')` should return `3`, as the string consists of the distinct characters `x`, `y`, and `z`.
- `countDistinctCharacters('Jerry')` should return `4`, as the string consists of the distinct characters `j`, `e`, `r`, and `y`.

You can add more test cases by calling the function with different strings and comparing the results with the expected values.

The time complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because creating a `Set` from an array takes linear time. The space complexity is also O(n), as the `Set` can potentially store all n characters from the input string.

In terms of scalability, the function can handle strings of any length. However, for very large strings, creating a `Set` may consume a significant amount of memory. In such cases, an alternative approach like using a hash table or a trie data structure could be considered for better performance and lower memory usage.

Overall, the function is a simple and
