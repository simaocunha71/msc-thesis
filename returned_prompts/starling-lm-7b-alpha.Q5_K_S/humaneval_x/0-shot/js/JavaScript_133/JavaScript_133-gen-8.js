The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input list. This is because we need to iterate through each element in the input list twice: once to round each element and push it into the `roundedList` array, and once to calculate the sum of squared values.

The space complexity is also O(n), as we create a new `roundedList` array to store the rounded values of the input list.

Overall, the function has a linear time and space complexity, as it performs
