Here is one possible solution:

```
const minSubArraySum = (nums) => {
  let minSum = nums[0];
  let currentSum = nums[0];

  for(let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
    currentSum = Math.min(currentSum + nums[i], nums[i]);
    minSum = Math.min(minSum, currentSum);
  }

  return minSum;
};
```

This algorithm works by initializing the `minSum` and `currentSum` to the first element of the array. Then, we iterate through the array starting from the second element. At each step, we update the `currentSum` to be the minimum of the current sum and the current element. We also update the `minSum` to be the minimum of the current sum and the previous minimum sum. Finally, we return the `minSum` as the result.

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array, because we only need to iterate through the array once. The space complexity is O(1) because we only need a few variables to store the current sum and the minimum sum.

Overall, this algorithm provides a concise and efficient solution to find the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array of an array of integers.

Here are some additional notes about the code:

- The `Math.min()` function is used to find the minimum of two values, which is useful for updating the `minSum` and `currentSum` variables.
- The `+=` operator is used to add the current element to the `currentSum`, which simplifies the update process.
- The `Math.min()` function is also used to update the `currentSum` to be the minimum of the current sum and the current element, ensuring that the `currentSum` is always the minimum sum of the sub-array ending at the current index.

With these optimizations and improvements, the provided solution efficiently solves the problem of finding the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array of an array of integers.

The provided algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), which is optimal for this problem. Additionally, the
