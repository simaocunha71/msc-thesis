/*
  Here is the detailed explanation of the code:

  This function returns true if the list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing and false otherwise.

  First, initialize a boolean variable isMonotonic to true.

  Then, loop through the list using a for loop. Inside the loop, check if the current element is greater than the next element. If it is, set isMonotonic to false and break the loop.

  After the loop, return the value of isMonotonic.

  This implementation checks if the list is monotonically increasing by comparing each element with its next element. If any element is greater than its next element, it means the list is not monotonically increasing, and the function returns false.

  Note that this implementation assumes the list is not empty, as the loop starts from index 0 and goes up to length - 1. If the list can be empty, you should add a check for that before starting the loop.

  The function can be tested using the test cases provided in the code comments.

  The function is exported at the end, so it can be used in other parts of the code.
