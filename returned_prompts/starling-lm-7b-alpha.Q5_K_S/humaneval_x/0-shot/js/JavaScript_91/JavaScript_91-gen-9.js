/*
  The above code is correct, but it can be optimized to reduce the time complexity
  from O(n) to O(1) by using the following approach:

  Instead of iterating over the entire string, we can simply check if the first
  character of the string is "I". If it is, we increment the count by 1. If not,
  we return the current count.

  This approach reduces the time complexity from O(n) to O(1) because we no
  longer need to iterate over the entire string. Instead, we only need to check
  the first character.

  Here's an optimized version of the code:

/*
  The above code is correct, but it can be further optimized by using a regular
  expression to match the pattern "I[.?!]" at the beginning of the string. This
  will allow us to count the number of boredoms in a single step, without the
  need for any iteration.
