/*
  You can use the `isBored` function like so:

  isBored("Hello world")
  //=> 0
  isBored("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather")
  //=> 1

*/






/*

Here are some additional tests you might want to try out:

  isBored("I don't like this place.") //=> 1
  isBored("I'm leaving!") //=> 1
  isBored("I'm going to the store.") //=> 1
  isBored("I am the very model of a modern major general.") //=> 0
  isBored("It's raining cats and dogs.") //=> 0


  The `isBored` function should be able to handle these cases too, and return the correct number of boredoms.
