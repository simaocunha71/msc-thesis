To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
1. Iterate over the list of strings. For each string, we will calculate the count of odd digits.
2. Inside the iteration, initialize a variable `count` to 0. Then, iterate over the digits of the string. For each digit, check if it is odd (i.e., its modulus with 2 is not equal to 0). If it is odd, increment the count variable by 1.
3. After the inner iteration, add a string to the result array. The string will have the format "the number of odd elements Xn the strXng X of the Xnput.", where X is replaced by the index of the current string in the input list and the count of odd digits.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for all strings in the list.
5. Return the result array.

The provided solution follows these steps. It defines a function `oddCount` that takes a list of strings as input. Inside the function, it initializes an empty array `result` to store the output strings.

The function then uses the `forEach` method to iterate over the input list. For each string, it initializes the `count` variable to 0. Then, it uses a `for` loop to iterate over the digits of the string. For each digit, it checks if it is odd by using the modulus operator (`%`). If the digit is odd, it increments the `count` variable by 1.

After counting the odd digits, the function adds a string to the `result` array. The
