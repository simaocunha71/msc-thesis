    if (n === 0) {
        return 0;
    } else if (n === 1) {
        return 0;
    } else if (n === 2) {
        return 1;
    }

    let a = 0;
    let b = 1;
    let c = 1;

    for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        c = a + b + c;
        a = b;
        b = c;
    }
    return c;
};

module.exports = fibfib;

To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:

1. First, we need to define the base cases for the FibFib sequence. The first two elements are 0, and the third element is 1.

2. Next, we can initialize three variables, a, b, and c, to keep track of the previous three elements in the sequence.

3. Then, we can use a for loop to iterate from 3 to n (inclusive). In each iteration, we calculate the next element in the sequence by adding the previous three elements (a, b, and c). We update the values of a, b, and c accordingly.

4. Finally, we return the value of c, which represents the nth element in the FibFib sequence.

By following these steps, we can efficiently compute the nth element of the FibFib sequence.

Note: The provided solution is in JavaScript, but the logic can be applied to other programming languages as well.

Here's an example usage of the fibfib function:

```javascript
console.log(fibfib(1)); // Output: 0
console.log(fibfib(5)); // Output: 4
console.log(fibfib(8)); // Output: 24
```

These examples demonstrate how the fibfib function can be used to calculate the nth element of the FibFib sequence.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
