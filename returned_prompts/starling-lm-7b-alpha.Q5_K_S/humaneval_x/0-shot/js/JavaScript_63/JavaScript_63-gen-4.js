To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to avoid repetitive calculations. We can use an array to store the results of the FibFib number sequence up to the nth element and return the result if it's already computed. Otherwise, we can calculate the result and save it in the array. Here's the code:

```python
def fibfib(n):
    fibs = [0, 0, 1]
    while len(fibs) <= n:
        fibs.append(fibs[-1] + fibs[-2] + fibs[-3])
    return fibs[n]
```

This code initializes the `fibs` array with the first three elements of the FibFib sequence. Then, it enters a loop that continues until the length of the `fibs` array is greater than or equal to `n`. In each iteration of the loop, it appends the sum of the last three elements of the `fibs` array to the end of the array. Finally, it returns the `n`th element of the `fibs` array, which is the result of the FibFib sequence at index `n`.

The time complexity of this code is O(n), which is the minimum complexity for computing the nth element of the FibFib sequence.

The space complexity of this code is O(n), which is the space required to store the FibFib sequence up to the nth element in the `fibs` array.

This solution is efficient because it avoids repetitive calculations by using dynamic programming to store previously computed results.

Here are some example test cases for this solution:
```python
print(fibfib(1))  # Output: 0
print(fibfib(5))  # Output: 4
print(fibfib(8))  # Output: 24
```

These test cases verify that the `fibfib` function correctly computes the nth element of the FibFib sequence according to the problem's requirements.

I hope this helps!

Additional Note:

For the Fibonacci sequence, the dynamic programming solution is even simpler because we only need to store the last two elements of the sequence to calculate
