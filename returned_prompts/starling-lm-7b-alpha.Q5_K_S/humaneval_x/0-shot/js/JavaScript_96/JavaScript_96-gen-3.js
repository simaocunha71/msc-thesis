*/

This function first initializes an empty array called "primes" to store all the prime numbers less than n. Then, using two nested for loops, the function checks if each number starting from 2 is a prime number. If a number is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself, it is not considered a prime number and the function moves to the next number. If a number is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself, it is considered a prime number and added to the "primes" array. Finally, the function returns the "primes" array.

For example, if the function is called with the argument 5, it will return the array [2,3] because these are the first two prime numbers less than 5.

To use this function, you can simply call it with the desired value of n and it will return the array of prime numbers less than n.

Here are some example usages:

countUpTo(5) // [2,3]
countUpTo(11) // [2,3,5,7]
countUpTo(0) // []
countUpTo(20) // [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19]
countUpTo(1) // []
countUpTo(18) //
