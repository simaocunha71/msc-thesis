Here's one way you could implement the `encrypt` function:

```
const encrypt = (s) => {
  let encryptedString = '';
  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    const char = s[i];
    let ascii = char.charCodeAt(0);
    if (ascii >= 97 && ascii <= 122) { // if the character is a lowercase letter
      ascii += 2 * 2; // shift down by two multiplied to two places
      if (ascii > 122) { // if the new ASCII value is greater than 'z'
        ascii -= 26; // wrap around to the beginning of the alphabet
      }
    }
    encryptedString += String.fromCharCode(ascii);
  }
  return encryptedString;
};
```

The function works by iterating over each character in the input string. If the character is a lowercase letter, it calculates the ASCII value of the character, and then adds 4 (2 multiplied by 2) to the ASCII value to rotate the character down by two multiplied to two places. If the new ASCII value is greater than the ASCII value of 'z', it wraps around to the beginning of the alphabet by subtracting 26 from the ASCII value. It then converts the new ASCII value back to a character and adds it to the encrypted string. If the character is not a lowercase letter, it simply adds the character to the encrypted string without rotation.

To use the function, you can call it with a string as an argument, like so:

```
console.log(encrypt('hi')); // Output: 'lm'
console.log(encrypt('asdfghjkl')); // Output: 'ewhjklnop'
console.log(encrypt('gf')); // Output: 'kj'
console.log(encrypt('et')); // Output: 'ix'
```

These are just a few examples of how you can test the function to ensure it is working correctly.

The function should also handle uppercase letters correctly, but
