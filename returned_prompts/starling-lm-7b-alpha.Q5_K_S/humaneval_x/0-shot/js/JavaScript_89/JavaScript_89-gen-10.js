Here's one possible solution:
```
const encrypt = (s) => {
  let result = '';
  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    let char = s[i];
    if (char.match(/[a-z]/i)) {
      char = String.fromCharCode(char.charCodeAt(0) + 2 * 2);
    }
    result += char;
  }
  return result;
}
```
Explanation:
In this function, we iterate over each character of the input string. If the character is a lowercase letter, we shift its ASCII code two places down by adding 2 * 2 to the character's ASCII code. We then convert the modified ASCII code back to a character using the `String.fromCharCode` method. Finally, we concatenate the modified character to the result string.

This process is repeated for each character in the input string, resulting in the encrypted string being returned by the function.

Example usage:
```
console.log(encrypt('hi')); // Output: 'lm'
console.log(encrypt('asdfghjkl')); // Output: 'ewhjklnop'
console.log(encrypt('gf')); // Output: 'kj'
console.log(encrypt('et')); // Output: 'ix'
```

The `encrypt` function correctly encrypts the given strings by shifting the alphabet down by two multiplied to two places.

Note: The `String.fromCharCode` method is used to convert the modified ASCII code back to a character. It takes the ASCII code as an argument and returns the corresponding character.

The `match` method is used to check if the character is a lowercase letter. It returns a match object if the character matches the regular expression, and `null` otherwise.

The `charCodeAt` method is used to get the ASCII code of a character at a specific index in a string. It returns the ASCII code as an integer.

The `charCodeAt` method is used in combination with the `charCodeAt` method to shift the ASCII code two places down by adding 2 *
