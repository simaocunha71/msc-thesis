To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a variable called `rotatedAlphabet` and assign it the value of the string "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz". This will be the original alphabet.
2. Create a variable called `rotatedBy` and assign it the value of 2. This is the number of positions that each letter should shift in the alphabet.
3. Use the `substring()` method to create a new string called `rotatedAlphabetRotated` that starts from the 0th index and ends at the `rotatedBy` index. This will create a substring of the original alphabet from the start up to the point where the rotation should start.
4. Use the `slice()` method to create a new string called `rotatedAlphabetRotatedRest` that starts from the `rotatedBy` index and ends at the end of the `rotatedAlphabet`. This will create a substring of the original alphabet from the point where the rotation should start until the end.
5. Use the `concat()` method to concatenate `rotatedAlphabetRotatedRest` with `rotatedAlphabetRotated`. This will create the rotated alphabet.
6. Create a variable called `rotatedS` and assign it the value of the string "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz". This will be the original alphabet for comparison.
7. Use the `split('')` method to create an array of characters from the `rotatedS` string. This will convert the string into an array of characters.
8. Use the `map()` method to iterate over each character in the `s` string and replace it with the corresponding character from the `rotatedAlphabet`. This will create a new array of characters with the encrypted string.
9. Use the `join('')` method to convert the array of characters back into a string. This will create the final encrypted string.
10. Return the `encryptedString` from the function.

Here's the code for the solution:

```javascript
const encrypt = (s) => {
  const rotatedAlphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";
  const rotatedBy = 2
