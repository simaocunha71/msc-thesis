*/

The given function `encrypt` takes a string `s` as an argument and returns a string that is encrypted using a rotated alphabet. The alphabet is rotated in such a way that each letter shifts down by two multiplied by two places. The function first defines the `alphabet` as a string of all lowercase letters in alphabetical order. Then, it initializes an empty string `encrypted` to store the encrypted result. 

The function then iterates through each character of the input string `s` using a `for` loop. Inside the loop, it checks if the current character `s[i]` is present in the `alphabet` string. If it is not found (i.e., the index of the character is -1), the function appends the original character to the `encrypted` string. Otherwise, it calculates the index of the character in the `alphabet` string and adds two multiplied by two to it to get the index of the corresponding encrypted character. The function appends this encrypted character to the `encrypted` string. 

Finally, the function returns the encrypted string. 

For example, if the input string is `'hi'`, the function will rotate the `'h'` by two multiplied by two places to get `'l'` and the `'i'` by the same amount to get `'m'`. The function will then concatenate these characters to the `encrypted` string, resulting in the output `'lm'`.

The function is exported as a module using `module.exports` so that it can be used in other parts of the program.
