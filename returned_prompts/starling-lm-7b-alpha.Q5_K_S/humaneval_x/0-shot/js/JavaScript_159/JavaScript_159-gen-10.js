Here is my code:

```javascript
let eaten = number + need;
let left = remaining - need;
if (left < 0) {
  left = 0;
}

return [eaten, left];
```

Explanation:

In this problem, we have three parameters: number, need and remaining.

The number of carrots that you have eaten is calculated by adding the number of carrots you ate before (number) to the number of carrots you need to eat (need).

The number of carrots left after your meals is calculated by subtracting the number of carrots you need to eat (need) from the number of remaining carrots (remaining). If the result is less than 0, then the number of carrots left will be 0.

Finally, we return an array with the calculated number of eaten carrots and the number of left carrots after your meals.

Hope this helps!
