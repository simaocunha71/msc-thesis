To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of carrots eaten and the remaining ones. We can do this by adding the number of eaten carrots to the number of carrots needed to be eaten and subtracting the remaining carrots. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. First, we add the number of eaten carrots (`number`) to the number of carrots needed to be eaten (`need`). This gives us the total number of carrots eaten.

2. Next, we subtract the remaining carrots (`remaining`) from the total number of carrots eaten. This gives us the remaining number of carrots after the meals.

3. If the total number of carrots eaten is greater than the remaining carrots, we return the remaining number of carrots as the result. Otherwise, we return the total number of carrots eaten.

In the provided example, if we have eaten 5 carrots and need to eat 6 carrots with a total of 10 carrots available, the total number of carrots eaten is 11 (5 + 6), and the remaining number of carrots is 4 (11 - 10). Therefore, the result is [11, 4].

The same logic applies to the other examples. For example, if we have eaten 4 carrots and need to eat 8 carrots with a total of 9 carrots available, the total number of carrots eaten is 12 (4 + 8), and the remaining number of carrots is 1 (12 - 9). Therefore, the result is [12, 1].

Here's the code that implements this logic:

```javascript
const eat = (number, need, remaining) => {
  const total = number + need;
  const eaten = total > remaining ? remaining : total;
  return [eaten, total - eaten];
};
```

This code defines a function called `eat` that takes three parameters: `number`, `need`, and `remaining`. It calculates the total number of carrots eaten by adding `number` and `need`, and then checks if the total is greater than the remaining carrots
