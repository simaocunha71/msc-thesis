The provided solution correctly solves the problem as described in the prompt. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. The function `eat` takes three arguments: `number`, `need`, and `remaining`. These represent the number of carrots already eaten, the number of carrots needed to complete the meals, and the total number of carrots available, respectively.

2. The variable `total` is initialized as the sum of the number of carrots already eaten (`number`) and the number of carrots needed to complete the meals (`need`).

3. The variable `left` is initialized as the difference between the total number of carrots available (`remaining`) and the number of carrots needed to complete the meals (`need`).

4. The `if` statement checks if the number of carrots left (`left`) is less than 0. If it is, it means that there are not enough carrots left to satisfy the hunger, so the number of carrots left (`left`) is set to 0.

5. Finally, the function returns an array containing the total number of eaten carrots (`total`) and the number of carrots left after the meals (`left`).

Overall, the solution correctly calculates the total number of carrots eaten and the number of carrots left based on the provided input values.
