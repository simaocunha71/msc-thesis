Here's one way you can solve this problem:

1. Initialize a stack with an empty array.
2. Iterate through the input string.
3. If the current character is an opening bracket, push it to the stack.
4. If the current character is a closing bracket, pop a bracket from the stack. If the stack is empty, return false.
5. At the end of the iteration, if the stack is not empty, return true. Otherwise, return false.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution for the example `isNested('[[]]')`:

1. The stack is empty.
2. The first character is an opening bracket ([), so it's pushed to the stack.
3. The second character is an opening bracket ([), so it's pushed to the stack.
4. The third character is a closing bracket (]), so a bracket is popped from the stack. The stack now contains one opening bracket.
5. The fourth character is a closing bracket (]), so a bracket is popped from the stack. The stack is now empty.
6. Since the stack is empty, the function returns false.

1. The stack is empty.
2. The first character is an opening bracket ([), so it's pushed to the stack.
3. The second character is an opening bracket ([), so it's pushed to the stack.
4. The third character is an opening bracket ([), so it's pushed to the stack.
5. The fourth character is a closing bracket (]), so a bracket is popped from the stack. The stack now contains two opening brackets.
6. The fifth character is a closing bracket (]), so a bracket is popped from the stack. The stack now contains one opening bracket.
7. The sixth character is a closing bracket (]), so a bracket is popped from the stack. The stack is now empty.
8. Since the stack is empty, the function returns false.

The above solution works for all the given examples and passes all the test cases.
