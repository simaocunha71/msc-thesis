Here's one way to solve the problem:

```javascript
const isNested = (string) => {
  let count = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < string.length; i++) {
    if (string[i] === '[') {
      count++;
    } else if (string[i] === ']') {
      count--;
    }
    if (count < 0) {
      return true;
    }
  }
  return count > 0;
};
```

Explanation:
The function iterates over each character of the input string and keeps track of the number of open brackets it has encountered so far in the variable `count`.

If the current character is an opening bracket (`[`), it increments the `count` by 1. If the current character is a closing bracket (`]`), it decrements the `count` by 1.

At any point, if the `count` becomes less than 0, it means that there is at least one bracket that is nested inside another bracket. In this case, the function returns `true`.

Finally, after iterating through all the characters in the input string, if the `count` is greater than 0, it means that there are no nested brackets in the string. In this case, the function returns `false`.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, as it iterates over each character of the string once.

The space complexity is O(1), as it only uses a single variable to keep track of the count of open brackets.

This solution is simple and straightforward, but it might not be the most efficient one for large inputs, as it needs to iterate through the entire string even if it contains only nested brackets.

Here are some examples of how the function works:

- For the input `'[[]]'`, the function returns `true` because there is at least one nested bracket (the innermost `[]`).
- For the input `'[]]]]]]][[[[[]'`, the function returns `false` because there are no nested brackets.
- For the input `'[][]'
