Here's a simple approach to solve this problem:

1. Iterate through the string and count the number of opening and closing brackets.
2. If the count of opening brackets is more than the count of closing brackets, then there exists at least one nested sequence of brackets.
3. If the count of opening brackets is less than or equal to the count of closing brackets, then it means there are no nested sequences of brackets.
4. Return true if there's at least one nested sequence, and false otherwise.

Here's the code for this approach:

```javascript
const isNested = (string) => {
  let count = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < string.length; i++) {
    if (string[i] === '[') {
      count++;
    } else {
      count--;
    }
    if (count < 0) {
      return true;
    }
  }
  return false;
};
```

This code defines a function `isNested` that takes a string as input. It initializes a variable `count` to 0, which will keep track of the number of opening brackets. Then, it iterates through each character in the string. If the character is an opening bracket '[', the `count` is incremented. If the character is a closing bracket ']', the `count` is decremented. If at any point the `count` becomes negative, it means there is at least one nested sequence of brackets, and the function returns true. If the loop completes without encountering a negative `count`, it means there are no nested sequences, and the function returns false.

You can use this function to check if a given string contains at least one nested sequence of brackets.

Example usage:

```javascript
console.log(isNested('[[]]'));  // Output: true
console.log(isNested('[]]]]]]][[[[[]'));  // Output: false
console.log(isNested('[][]'));  // Output: false
console.log(isNested('[]'));  // Output: false
console.log(isNested('[[][]]
