To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Initialize a new array called `l_sorted` with the same length as `l`.
2. Iterate over each element in `l`.
3. Check if the index of the element is divisible by 3. If it is, replace the corresponding element in `l_sorted` with the sorted version of the element. Otherwise, copy the element from `l` to `l_sorted`.
4. Return `l_sorted`.

Here's an example implementation of the solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
const sortThird = (l) => {
  const l_sorted = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < l.length; i++) {
    if (i % 3 === 0) {
      l_sorted[i] = l[i].sort();
    } else {
      l_sorted[i] = l[i];
    }
  }
  return l_sorted;
};
```

This implementation uses a for loop to iterate over each element in `l`. If the index of the element is divisible by 3, it sorts the element using the `sort()` method and assigns it to the corresponding index in `l_sorted`. Otherwise, it assigns the element from `l` to `l_sorted`. Finally, it returns `l_sorted`.

You can test the function with the provided test cases:

```javascript
console.log(sortThird([1, 2, 3])); // [1, 2, 3]
console.log(sortThird([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])); // [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
```

These test cases should pass and return the expected outputs.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input list `l`. This is because it iterates over each element in the list once.

The space complexity is also O(n) because it creates a new array `l_sorted` with the same length as the input list `l`.

Overall,
