To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a copy of the input array `l` using the `slice()` method, and assign it to a variable called `sortedThird`.
2. Iterate through the `sortedThird` array using the `forEach()` method. For each element at index `i` in the array, check if `i` is divisible by 3 using the modulo operator (`i % 3 == 0`). If the condition is true, reassign the value at index `i` in the `sortedThird` array to the sorted version of the value at index `i` in the original array `l`. You can use the `sort()` method to sort the values. If the condition is false, assign the value at index `i` in the `sortedThird` array to be the same as the value at index `i` in the original array `l`.
3. Return the sorted array `sortedThird`.

Here's the code for the solution:

```javascript
const sortThird = (l) => {
  const sortedThird = l.slice();

  sortedThird.forEach((_, i) => {
    if (i % 3 === 0) {
      sortedThird[i] = l[i].sort();
    }
  });

  return sortedThird;
};
```

This implementation ensures that the values at indices divisible by three in the `sortedThird` array are sorted, while the other indices remain unchanged.

You can use the `sortThird` function by passing in an array as an argument. It will return a new array with the specified changes. Here are a couple of examples:

```javascript
console.log(sortThird([1, 2, 3])); // Output: [1, 2, 3]
console.log(sortThird([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])); // Output: [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
```

These examples demonstrate how the `sortThird` function works with different input arrays.
