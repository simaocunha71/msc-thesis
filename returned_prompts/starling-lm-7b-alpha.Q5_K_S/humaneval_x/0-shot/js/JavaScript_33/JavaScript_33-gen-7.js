To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a function called `sortThird` that takes a list `l` as an argument.
2. Inside the function, create a variable called `lNew` and assign it the value of `l`. This variable will be used to store the modified list.
3. Create a variable called `index` and assign it the value of `0`. This variable will be used to iterate through the indices of the list.
4. Use a `while` loop to iterate through the indices of the list until the value of `index` is less than the length of the list.
5. Inside the loop, check if the current index (`index`) is divisible by three using the modulo operator (`%`). If it is, sort the values at the current index and the next index in the list using the `sort` method.
6. Update the value of `index` by adding one to it using the `+=` operator.
7. After the loop, return the modified list `lNew` as the result of the function.
8. Test the function with the provided test cases to ensure it works correctly.

Here's the code for the solution:

```javascript
const sortThird = (l) => {
  const lNew = l;
  let index = 0;
  while (index < l.length) {
    if (index % 3 === 0) {
      lNew.sort(index, index + 1);
    }
    index += 1;
  }
  return lNew;
};
```

Note: The `sort` method in JavaScript is used to sort the elements of an array in place and returns the sorted array.

const l = [1, 2, 3];
const lNew = sortThird(l);
console.log(lNew);  // [1, 2, 3]

const l2 = [5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2];
const lNew2 = sortThird(l2);
console.log(lNew2);  // [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
```python
