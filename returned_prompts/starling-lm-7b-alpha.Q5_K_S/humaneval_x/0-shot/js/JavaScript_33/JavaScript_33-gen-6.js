In the provided code, the sortThird function is defined to take a list l as an argument and returns a new list l' that is identical to l in the indices that are not divisible by three. The values at the indices that are divisible by three are replaced by the sorted values of the corresponding indices in the original list l.

To achieve this, the function first creates a new list, called sortedList, that contains the sorted values of the indices of l that are divisible by three. This is done using the filter method to select the indices divisible by three and the sort method to sort them in ascending order.

Next, the function uses the map method to iterate over the original list l. For each index i in l, if i is divisible by three, the value at that index in l' is replaced with the sorted value at the corresponding index in sortedList. Otherwise, the value at index i in l' remains the same as the value at index i in l.

Finally, the function returns the modified list l'.

The provided test cases demonstrate the correctness of the function. The first test case, sortThird([1, 2, 3]), returns the original list [1, 2, 3] as there are no indices divisible by three in the list. The second test case, sortThird([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]), returns the modified list [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5] as the values at indices 3, 6, and 9 (divisible by three) are replaced by the sorted values [3, 4, 8, 9].

Overall, the sortThird function correctly modifies the original list l by sorting the values at indices divisible by three while leaving the rest of the list unchanged.
