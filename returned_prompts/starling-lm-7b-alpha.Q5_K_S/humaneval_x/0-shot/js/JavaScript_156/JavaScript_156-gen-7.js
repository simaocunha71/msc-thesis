The provided code defines a function `intToMiniRoman` that takes a positive integer as input and returns its Roman numeral equivalent as a string. The function uses an object `romanNumbers` to map each Roman numeral to its corresponding decimal value. It then initializes an empty string `result` to store the Roman numeral representation of the input number.

The function sorts the keys of the `romanNumbers` object in descending order based on their decimal values. This is done to ensure that the Roman numerals are added in the correct order, following the rules of Roman numerals. 

The function then enters a while loop, which continues as long as the input number is greater than 0. Inside the loop, a for loop iterates over the sorted keys of the `romanNumbers` object. For each key, the function checks if the input number is greater than or equal to the corresponding decimal value. If it is, the Roman numeral is added to the `result` string and the input number is decremented by the decimal value of the Roman numeral. This process is repeated until the input number
