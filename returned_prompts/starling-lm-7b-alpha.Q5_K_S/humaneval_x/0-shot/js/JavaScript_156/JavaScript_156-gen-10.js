Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Define an object called `miniRomanMap` that maps Roman numeral symbols to their corresponding integer values.
2. Initialize an empty string called `result` to store the resulting Roman numeral.
3. Initialize a variable `i` to keep track of the current position in the `miniRomanMap` object.
4. Use a `while` loop to iterate while the `number` is greater than 0.
   a. Inside the loop, get the current value from `miniRomanMap` using the key at index `i`.
   b. While the `number` is greater than or equal to the current value, add the corresponding Roman numeral symbol to the `result` string and subtract the current value from the `number`.
   c. Increment `i` to move to the next Roman numeral symbol in the `min
