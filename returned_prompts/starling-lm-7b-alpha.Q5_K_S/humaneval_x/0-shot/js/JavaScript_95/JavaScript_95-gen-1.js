To solve this problem, we first need to extract all the keys from the dictionary using the Object.keys() method and store them in the 'keys' array. If the length of the 'keys' array is zero, it means that the dictionary is empty, and we should return false.

Next, we create two new arrays: 'lowerCaseKeys' and 'upperCaseKeys'. The 'lowerCaseKeys' array will store all the keys that are not equal to their lowercase version, and the 'upperCaseKeys' array will store all the keys that are equal to their uppercase version.

To create these arrays, we use the filter() method on the 'keys' array. The filter() method takes a callback function as an argument, which is executed for each element in the 'keys' array. Inside the callback function, we compare the key with its lowercase and uppercase versions using the toLowerCase() and toUpperCase() methods. If the key is equal to its lowercase version, it means that it is already in lowercase, so we don't include it in the 'lowerCaseKeys' array. Similarly, if the key is equal to its uppercase version, we don't include it in the 'upperCaseKeys' array.

Finally, we check if the length of both the 'lowerCaseKeys' and 'upperCaseKeys' arrays is zero. If both arrays are empty, it means that all keys in the dictionary are either in lowercase or uppercase, and we return true. Otherwise, we return false.
