To check if all keys in a dictionary are in lower case or upper case, you can follow the steps below:

1. Check if the dictionary is empty by using the `Object.keys(dict).length` method. If the length is 0, it means the dictionary is empty, and we can immediately return `false`.

2. If the dictionary is not empty, use `Object.keys(dict)` to get all keys of the dictionary.

3. Iterate over each key using a `for...of` loop. For each key, compare its lower case version (`key.toLowerCase()`) with the original key. If they are not equal, and the upper case version (`key.toUpperCase()`) is also not equal to the original key, it means the key is neither all lower case nor all upper case, so we can immediately return `false`.

4. If the loop completes without returning `false`, it means all keys are either all lower case or all upper case, so we can return `true`.

In the provided code, the `checkDictCase` function follows these steps to determine if all keys in the dictionary are in lower case or upper case. The function is tested with various examples to verify its correctness.
