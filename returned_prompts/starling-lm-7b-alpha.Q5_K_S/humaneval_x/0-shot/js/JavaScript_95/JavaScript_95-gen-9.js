To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Initialize a flag variable `allLowerCase` to `true` if all keys in the dictionary are lowercase, and `false` otherwise.
2. Initialize a flag variable `allUpperCase` to `true` if all keys in the dictionary are uppercase, and `false` otherwise.
3. Iterate through the keys in the dictionary. For each key:
   a. If the key is not a string, return `false`.
   b. Check if the key is in lowercase and update the `allLowerCase` flag accordingly.
   c. Check if the key is in uppercase and update the `allUpperCase` flag accordingly.
4. If both `allLowerCase` and `allUpperCase` are `true`, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

Here's the implementation of the solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
const checkDictCase = (dict) => {
  const allLowerCase = Object.keys(dict).every((key) => typeof key === 'string' && key.toLowerCase() === key);
  const allUpperCase = Object.keys(dict).every((key) => typeof key === 'string' && key.toUpperCase() === key);
  return !allLowerCase && !allUpperCase;
}
```

This solution ensures that all keys in the dictionary are either in lowercase or uppercase by checking each key individually. It uses the `Object.keys()` method to iterate through the keys in the dictionary and the `every()` method to check if all keys satisfy the conditions. The `typeof` operator is used to ensure that the keys are indeed strings.

Finally, the solution returns `false` if all keys are not in lowercase and not in uppercase, indicating that the dictionary does not meet the required conditions.

You can use this function to check the case consistency of dictionaries in your code.

Note: The solution assumes that the input dictionary is a valid JavaScript object with string keys and string values.

Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.
