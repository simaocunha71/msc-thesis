To find the largest prime factor of a given number, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize a variable "largest" with the value of the given number, n.
2. Create a while loop that continues as long as the value of n is greater than 1. This loop will be responsible for finding the largest prime factor of n.
3. Inside the loop, use a for loop to iterate over a range of numbers starting from 2 and ending at the square root of n. This range will be used to check for factors of n.
4. Inside the for loop, check if the current number (i) is a factor of n. This can be done by using the modulo operator (n % i) to check if the remainder is equal to 0. If it is, then i is a factor of n.
5. If i is a factor of n, update the value of n to n / i and continue with the loop. This will reduce the value of n and move on to the next factor.
6. After the for loop has finished iterating, the value of n will be the largest prime factor of the original number. Assign this value to the variable "largest" and return it.
7. If no factors are found inside the for loop, this means that n itself is a prime number. In this case, return the value of n as the largest prime factor.

Here's an example implementation of the solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
const largestPrimeFactor = (n) => {
  let largest = n;

  while (n > 1) {
    for (let i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(n); i++) {
      if (n % i === 0) {
        largest = n / i;
        n = n / i;
        break;
      }
    }
  }

  return largest;
};
```

This implementation uses a while loop to iterate until the value of n is no longer greater than 1. Inside the while loop, a for loop is used to check for factors of n, starting from 2 and ending at the square root of n. If a factor is found, it is used to update the value of n and the largest prime factor is updated accordingly. After the for loop finishes iterating, the largest prime factor
