To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Initialize a variable `largest` with the value of `n`. This variable will keep track of the largest prime factor found so far.

2. Use a `while` loop to repeatedly divide `n` by its largest prime factor until `n` becomes 1. This loop will run as long as `n` is divisible by 2. In each iteration, update the `largest` variable with the largest prime factor found.

3. To find the largest prime factor of `n`, you can start by checking if `n` is divisible by 2. If it is, divide `n` by 2 and update the `largest` variable. Repeat this step until `n` is no longer divisible by 2. This step ensures that any even prime factors are removed.

4. After removing any even prime factors, you can use a `for` loop to check if `n` is divisible by any odd prime numbers starting from 3 up to the square root of `n`. You can calculate the square root of `n` using the `Math.sqrt()` function. This step ensures that any odd prime factors are checked.

5. In each iteration of the `for` loop, check if `n` is divisible by the current prime number. If it is, divide `n` by the prime number and update the `largest` variable. Repeat this step until `n` is no longer divisible by the prime number. This step ensures that any odd prime factors are removed.

6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until `n` becomes 1. This ensures that all prime factors of `n` are checked.

7. Finally, return the value of the `largest` variable, which represents the largest prime factor of `n`.

Here's an example implementation of the `largestPrimeFactor` function using the steps outlined above:

```javascript
const largestPrimeFactor = (n) => {
  let largest = n;

  while (n % 2 === 0) {
    largest = 2;
    n /= 2;
  }

  for (let i = 3; i * i <= n; i += 2) {
    while (n % i ===
