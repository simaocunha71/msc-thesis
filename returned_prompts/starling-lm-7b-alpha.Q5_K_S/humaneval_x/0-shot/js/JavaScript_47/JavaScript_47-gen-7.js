To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Sort the list in ascending order. This can be done using the `sort()` method in JavaScript.
2. Calculate the middle index of the sorted list. If the length of the list is even, take the average of the two middle elements.
3. Return the middle element or elements.

Here's the modified code:

```javascript
const median = (l) => {
  l.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  const middleIndex = Math.floor(l.length / 2);
  if (l.length % 2 === 0) {
    return (l[middleIndex - 1] + l[middleIndex]) / 2;
  } else {
    return l[middleIndex];
  }
};
```

Now you can use the `median()` function to find the median of any list of numbers.

For example:

```javascript
console.log(median([3, 1, 2, 4, 5]));  // Output: 3
console.log(median([-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20]));  // Output: 8
```

In the first example, the list `[3, 1, 2, 4, 5]` is sorted to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. The middle index is 2, and since the length of the list is odd, the median is the element at index 2, which is 3.

In the second example, the list `[-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20]` is sorted to `[-10, 4, 6, 10, 1000, 20]`. The middle index is 3, but since the length of the list is even, we take the average of the two middle elements (6 and 10) to get the median of 8.

By following these steps, you can accurately calculate the median of a given list of numbers using JavaScript.

Note: The `sort()` method sorts the list in
