To solve this kata, follow these steps:

1. Calculate the mean of the input list
2. Calculate the absolute difference between each element and the mean
3. Calculate the average of these absolute differences

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the provided solution:

1. The mean is calculated by finding the sum of all numbers and dividing by the total quantity.
2. The absolute differences are calculated by subtracting the mean from each number and taking the absolute value of the result.
3. The mean of the absolute differences is calculated by adding all the absolute differences and dividing by the total quantity.

Here's the provided solution in Python:

```python
def meanAbsoluteDeviation(numbers):
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    abs_diffs = [abs(x - mean) for x in numbers]
    return sum(abs_diffs) / len(abs_diffs)
```

You can test the function with the provided example:

```python
print(meanAbsoluteDeviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]))  # Output: 1.0
```

The function will return the Mean Absolute Deviation of the provided list of numbers.

In this case, the Mean Absolute Deviation of the list [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0] is 1.0, as the mean of the list is 2.5 and all the absolute differences from the mean are 0.5.

You can try different inputs to see how the function works.

Here's a Python implementation of the solution:

```python
def meanAbsoluteDeviation(numbers):
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    abs_diffs = [abs(x - mean) for x in numbers]
    return sum(abs_diffs) / len(abs_diffs)
```

You can test the function with the provided example:

```python
print(meanAbsoluteDeviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]))  # Output: 1.0
```
