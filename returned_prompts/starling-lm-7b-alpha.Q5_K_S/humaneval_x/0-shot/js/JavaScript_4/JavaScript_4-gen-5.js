To calculate Mean Absolute Deviation, first you need to find the mean of the numbers. Then for each number, subtract the mean and take the absolute value of the result. Add up all these absolute values and divide by the number of elements in the array. Here's how you can do it in Python:

```python
def meanAbsoluteDeviation(numbers):
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    absolute_differences = [abs(x - mean) for x in numbers]
    return sum(absolute_differences) / len(numbers)

print(meanAbsoluteDeviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]))  # Output: 1.0
```

In this solution, we first calculate the mean of the numbers by adding all the numbers together and dividing by the length of the array. Then we use a list comprehension to create a new list that contains the absolute difference between each number and the mean. Finally, we sum up all the absolute differences and divide by the length of the array to get the Mean Absolute Deviation.

This code will correctly calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation for any given list of numbers.

The output of the provided test case `meanAbsoluteDeviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])` is `1.0`.





Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. Define a function called `meanAbsoluteDeviation` that takes in an array of numbers as its parameter.
2. Calculate the mean of the numbers by summing all the numbers together and dividing by the length of the array. Store the result in a variable called `mean`.
3. Use a list comprehension to create a new list called `absolute_differences`. This list will contain the absolute difference between each number and the mean. For example, if the mean is 2.5 and the number is 1.0, the absolute difference would be `abs(1.0 - 2.5) = 1.5`.
4. Sum up all the absolute differences in the `absolute_differences` list using the `sum` function. Store the result in a variable called `sum_of_dif
