To calculate the mean of the given dataset, we can use the built-in JavaScript function `reduce()` on the array `numbers` to sum all the elements and then divide by the number of elements.
To calculate the MAD, we can subtract the mean from each element of the dataset, take the absolute value of the result, and then calculate the average of all these values. Again, we can use the built-in JavaScript function `reduce()`.

Here is the implementation:

```javascript
const meanAbsoluteDeviation = (numbers) => {
  const mean = numbers.reduce((a, b) => a + b) / numbers.length;
  const deviations = numbers.map(n => Math.abs(n - mean));
  return deviations.reduce((a, b) => a + b) / numbers.length;
}
```

The function `meanAbsoluteDeviation` takes an array of numbers as its argument and returns the mean absolute deviation of the dataset.

To calculate the mean, we use the `reduce()` method on the `numbers` array. The `reduce()` method iterates over all elements of the array and applies the provided callback function to reduce the array to a single value. In this case, the callback function adds all the elements of the array (`a` and `b`). The result is divided by the length of the `numbers` array to get the mean.

To calculate the MAD, we use the `map()` method on the `numbers` array to create a new array with the absolute difference between each element and the mean. The `map()` method iterates over all elements of the array and applies the provided callback function to create a new array. In this case, the callback function calculates the absolute difference between each element (`n`) and the mean (`mean`).

Finally, we use the `reduce()` method again to calculate the average of the absolute differences. The `reduce()` method iterates over all elements of the `deviations` array and applies the provided callback function to reduce the array to a single value. In this case, the callback function adds all the elements of the array (`a` and `b`). The result is divided by the length of the `numbers` array to get the mean absolute deviation.
