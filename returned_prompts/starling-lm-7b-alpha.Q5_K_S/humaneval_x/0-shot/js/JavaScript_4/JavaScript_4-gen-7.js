To calculate the mean, we add up all the numbers in the array and divide by the total number of elements. To calculate the absolute deviation, we find the difference between each element and the mean, and then take the absolute value of that difference. Finally, we find the average of all the absolute deviations to get the mean absolute deviation. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. Initialize a variable `sum` to store the sum of all the numbers in the array. Set it to 0.
2. Initialize a variable `mean` to store the mean of the array. Set it to 0.
3. Initialize a variable `absDeviations` to store the absolute deviations. Set it to an empty array.
4. Iterate through each number in the input array using a for loop:
   a. Calculate the absolute deviation by taking the absolute value of the difference between the current number and the mean.
   b. Add the absolute deviation to the `sum` variable.
   c. Push the absolute deviation into the `absDeviations` array.
5. After the loop ends, calculate the mean by dividing the `sum` by the total number of elements in the array. Store the result in the `mean` variable.
6. Calculate the mean absolute deviation by dividing the `sum` of absolute deviations by the total number of elements in the `absDeviations` array. Store the result in the `mad` variable.
7. Return the `mad` variable as the result of the function.

Here's the code implementation of the solution:

```javascript
const meanAbsoluteDeviation = (numbers) => {
  let sum = 0;
  let mean = 0;
  let absDeviations = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    let absoluteDeviation = Math.abs(numbers[i] - mean);
    sum += absoluteDeviation;
    absDeviations.push(absoluteDeviation);
  }

  mean = sum / numbers.length;
  let mad = sum / absDeviations.length;

  return mad;
};
```

By following these steps, you can calculate the mean absolute
