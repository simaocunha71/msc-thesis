To calculate Mean Absolute Deviation, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the mean of the list of input numbers.
2. Subtract the mean from each number in the list, then take the absolute value of the result. This will give us the absolute deviations of each number from the mean.
3. Calculate the average of the absolute deviations obtained in step 2. This will give us the Mean Absolute Deviation.

Here's how you can implement the meanAbsoluteDeviation function:

```javascript
const meanAbsoluteDeviation = (numbers) => {
  const mean = numbers.reduce((sum, num) => sum + num) / numbers.length;
  const absoluteDeviations = numbers.map(num => Math.abs(num - mean));
  const mad = absoluteDeviations.reduce((sum, dev) => sum + dev) / absoluteDeviations.length;
  return mad;
};
```

You can use the function like this:

```javascript
console.log(meanAbsoluteDeviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]));  // Output: 1.0
```

This implementation calculates the mean of the input numbers, then calculates the absolute deviations for each number from the mean. Finally, it calculates the average of these absolute deviations to obtain the Mean Absolute Deviation.

Note: The Math.abs() function is used to get the absolute value of a number. The reduce() function is used to calculate the sum of all the absolute deviations, and the map() function is used to apply the absolute value function to each number in the array.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
