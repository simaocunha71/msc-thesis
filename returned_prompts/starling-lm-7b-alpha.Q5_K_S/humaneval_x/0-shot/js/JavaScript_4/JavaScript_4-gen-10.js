To calculate mean absolute deviation we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the mean of the array.
2. Subtract the mean from each element in the array.
3. Find the absolute value of the result of step 2.
4. Find the average of the absolute values.

The `meanAbsoluteDeviation` function takes in an array of numbers as an argument. It first calculates the mean of the array using the `reduce` method and the `mean` function. It then uses the `map` method to subtract the mean from each element in the array, and the `Math.abs` method to find the absolute value of the result. Finally, it uses the `reduce` method again to find the sum of all the absolute values, and divides it by the length of the array to find the average. The result is then returned.

Here's a breakdown of the function:

```javascript
const meanAbsoluteDeviation = (numbers) => {
  // Calculate the mean of the array
  const mean = numbers.reduce((sum, num) => sum + num, 0) / numbers.length;

  // Subtract the mean from each element in the array and find the absolute value
  const absoluteDifferences = numbers.map(num => Math.abs(num - mean));

  // Find the average of the absolute values
  const mad = absoluteDifferences.reduce((sum, dif) => sum + dif, 0) / absoluteDifferences.length;

  return mad;
};
```

To test the function, you can call it with an array of numbers, like `meanAbsoluteDeviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])`. This will return the mean absolute deviation of the given array, which is `1.0`.

The function is written in a functional programming style, using higher-order functions like `reduce` and `map` to perform operations on arrays.

It's important to note that the `reduce` method is used twice in this function. The first time it is used to calculate the sum of all the numbers in the array and divide it by the length of the array to find the mean. The second time it is used to calculate the sum of all the absolute differences and divide it by the
