To calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD), we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the mean (average) of the given list of numbers.
2. Calculate the absolute difference between each number and the mean.
3. Calculate the average of all the absolute differences.

Here is the code to achieve this in JavaScript:

```javascript
const meanAbsoluteDeviation = (numbers) => {
  const mean = numbers.reduce((a, b) => a + b) / numbers.length;
  const absoluteDifferences = numbers.map(num => Math.abs(num - mean));
  return absoluteDifferences.reduce((a, b) => a + b) / absoluteDifferences.length;
};
```

In this code, we first calculate the mean by summing all the numbers in the list and dividing by the length of the list. Then, we map over the numbers and calculate the absolute difference between each number and the mean using `Math.abs()`. Next, we calculate the average of all the absolute differences by summing them and dividing by the length of the list.

For example, if we call `meanAbsoluteDeviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])`, the function will return `1.0`, as the mean is `2.5` and the absolute differences are `1.5`, `1.5`, `1.5`, and `1.5`, with an average of `1.5`.

It's worth noting that the MAD is a robust measure of dispersion, as it is less affected by outliers compared to the standard deviation.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
```

```python
import math

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers):
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    absolute_differences = [abs(num - mean) for num in numbers]
    return sum(absolute_differences) / len(absolute_differences)
```

In this Python code, we first calculate the mean by summing all the numbers in the list and dividing by the length of the list. Then, we use a list comprehens
