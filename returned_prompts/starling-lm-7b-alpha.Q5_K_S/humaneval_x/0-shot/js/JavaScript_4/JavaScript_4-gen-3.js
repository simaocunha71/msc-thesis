To calculate the mean absolute deviation, follow these steps:

1. Calculate the mean of the numbers in the dataset.
2. For each number in the dataset, calculate the absolute difference between the number and the mean.
3. Calculate the average of these absolute differences.

Here is a step-by-step guide to implementing meanAbsoluteDeviation:

1. Calculate the mean of the numbers in the dataset. You can calculate the mean by adding all the numbers in the dataset together and dividing by the number of elements in the dataset.
   Let's calculate the mean of the dataset [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]. First, add all the numbers together: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. Then, divide by the number of elements in the dataset, which is 4: 10 / 4 = 2.5. The mean of the dataset is 2.5.

2. For each number in the dataset, calculate the absolute difference between the number and the mean. The absolute difference between two numbers is the distance between them on a number line. You can calculate the absolute difference between a number and the mean by subtracting the mean from the number and taking the absolute value of the result.
   Let's calculate the absolute difference between each number in the dataset [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0] and the mean of the dataset, which is 2.5. For the number 1.0, the absolute difference is |1.0 - 2.5| = 1.5. For the number 2.0, the absolute difference is |2.0 - 2.5| = 0.5. For the number 3.0, the absolute difference is |3.0 - 2.5| = 0.5. For the number 4.0, the absolute difference is |4.0 - 2.5| = 1.5.

3. Calculate the average of these absolute differences. You can calculate the average by adding all the absolute differences together and dividing by the number of elements in the dataset.
   Let's calculate the average of the absolute differences between the dataset [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4
