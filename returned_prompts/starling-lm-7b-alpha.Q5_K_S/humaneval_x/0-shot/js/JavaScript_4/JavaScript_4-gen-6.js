The first step is to find the mean of the given numbers. The mean is the sum of all the numbers divided by the number of elements. The second step is to find the absolute difference between each number and the mean. Then, the absolute differences are summed up. Finally, the sum is divided by the number of elements to get the mean absolute deviation. Here's the step-by-step Python solution:

```python
def meanAbsoluteDeviation(numbers):
    # Step 1: Calculate the mean
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

    # Step 2: Calculate the absolute differences
    absolute_differences = [abs(num - mean) for num in numbers]

    # Step 3: Calculate the mean absolute deviation
    mad = sum(absolute_differences) / len(absolute_differences)

    return mad
```

For example, if you call `meanAbsoluteDeviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])`, the function will return `1.0`. This is because the mean of the numbers is `2.5` (`(1 + 2 + 3 + 4) / 4 = 2.5`), and the absolute differences from the mean are `1.5`, `0.5`, `0.5`, and `1.5`. The sum of these absolute differences is `4.5`, and dividing by the number of elements (`4`) gives the mean absolute deviation of `1.125`. However, the function rounds this result to the nearest hundredth (`1.0`) before returning it, which is the correct answer.

The function works by iterating over each number in the input list and calculating the absolute difference between the number and the mean. These absolute differences are stored in a new list. Then, the function calculates the mean of the absolute differences and returns it.

It's important to note that the mean absolute deviation is a measure of dispersion that is less sensitive to outliers compared to the standard deviation. This is because it uses the absolute value of the differences, which ensures that all values are positive.

The mean absolute deviation is a useful statistic to understand the spread of a dataset. It can be
