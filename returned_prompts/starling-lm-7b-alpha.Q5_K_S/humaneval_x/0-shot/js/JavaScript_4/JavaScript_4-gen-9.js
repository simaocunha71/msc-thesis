To calculate the mean absolute deviation around the mean of a dataset, you can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the mean of the dataset.
2. Subtract the mean from each element in the dataset.
3. Take the absolute value of the result of step 2.
4. Calculate the average of the absolute values obtained in step 3.

Here's a step-by-step implementation of the algorithm:

1. Calculate the mean of the dataset:
   - Initialize a variable `sum` to hold the sum of all numbers in the dataset.
   - Iterate through each number in the dataset and add it to the `sum`.
   - Divide the `sum` by the length of the dataset to get the mean.

2. Subtract the mean from each element in the dataset:
   - Initialize an empty array `differences` to store the differences between each element and the mean.
   - Iterate through each number in the dataset.
   - Subtract the mean from each number, and push the result to the `differences` array.

3. Take the absolute value of the result of step 2:
   - Use the `map` function to iterate through each element in the `differences` array.
   - For each element, take the absolute value using the `Math.abs` function.

4. Calculate the average of the absolute values obtained in step 3:
   - Use the `reduce` function to iterate through each element in the `differences` array.
   - For each element, add it to the `sum` variable.
   - Divide the `sum` by the length of the `differences` array to get the mean absolute deviation.

Here's the code for the `meanAbsoluteDeviation` function that follows these steps:

```javascript
const meanAbsoluteDeviation = (numbers) => {
  const sum = numbers.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
  const mean = sum / numbers.length;
  const differences = numbers.map(n => Math.abs(n - mean));
  const mad = differences.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0) / differences.length;
  return mad;
};
```
