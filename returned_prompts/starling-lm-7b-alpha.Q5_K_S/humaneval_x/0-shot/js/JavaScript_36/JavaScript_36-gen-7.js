To solve this problem, we need to iterate through all the numbers from 0 to n-1. Then, we need to check if the number is divisible by 11 or 13 and if it contains the digit 7. Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. Initialize a counter variable to keep track of the number of times the digit 7 appears in the required numbers. Let's call it `count`.

2. Use a for loop to iterate through all the numbers from 0 to n-1.

3. Inside the loop, check if the current number is divisible by either 11 or 13 using the modulus operator (%). If it is, move to step 4. Otherwise, continue to the next iteration of the loop.

4. Check if the current number contains the digit 7. We can do this by converting the number to a string and using the includes() method to check if the string contains the character '7'. If it does, increment the `count` variable by 1.

5. After the loop is finished, return the value of the `count` variable.

Here's an example implementation of the solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
const fizzBuzz = (n) => {
  let count = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (i % 11 === 0 || i % 13 === 0) {
      if (i.toString().includes('7')) {
        count++;
      }
    }
  }

  return count;
};
```

This implementation will return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.

For example, if we call `fizzBuzz(50)`, it will return 0 because there are no numbers less than 50 that are divisible by 11 or 13 and contain the digit 7. If we call `fizzBuzz(78)`, it will return 2 because the numbers 77 and 78 are divisible by 11 or 13 and contain the digit 7. If we call `fizzBuzz(79)`,
