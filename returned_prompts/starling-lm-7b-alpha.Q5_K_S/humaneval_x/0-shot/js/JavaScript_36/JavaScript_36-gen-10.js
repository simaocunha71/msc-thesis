To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Initialize a counter variable to keep track of the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.
2. Iterate through all integers less than n, starting from 1.
3. For each integer, check if it is divisible by 11 or 13 by using the modulus operator (%). If it is divisible, proceed to the next step.
4. Convert the integer to a string using the toString() method. This is necessary because we want to check if the string contains the digit 7.
5. Use the includes() method to check if the string contains the digit 7. If it does, increment the counter variable.
6. After checking all integers, return the value of the counter variable, which represents the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.

Note: The code provided in the solution includes a function called fizzBuzz that implements the above steps. You can use this function to solve the problem by calling it with the desired value of n.

Here's an example usage of the fizzBuzz function:

```javascript
console.log(fizzBuzz(50));  // Output: 0
console.log(fizzBuzz(78));  // Output: 2
console.log(fizzBuzz(79));  // Output: 3
```

In the above examples, the fizzBuzz function is called with different values of n. The function returns the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13, as specified in the problem statement.

You can test the function with
