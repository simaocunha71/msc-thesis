To solve this kata, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize a variable to store the count of the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13. Let's call it 'count'.

2. Use a for loop to iterate through all the integers less than 'n'. For each integer, check if it is divisible by 11 or 13. If it is, check if the integer contains the digit 7. If it does, increment the count.

3. After the loop is completed, return the value of 'count'.

Here's a Python implementation of the solution:

```python
def fizzBuzz(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if (i % 11 == 0) or (i % 13 == 0):
            if '7' in str(i):
                count += 1
    return count
```

This implementation iterates through all the integers less than 'n' and checks if each integer is divisible by 11 or 13. If it is, it checks if the integer contains the digit 7. If it does, it increments the count. Finally, it returns the count.

For example, if we call `fizzBuzz(78)`, it will return 2 because there are two integers less than 78 that are divisible by 11 or 13 and contain the digit 7 (i.e., 63 and 72).

Similarly, if we call `fizzBuzz(79)`, it will return 3 because there are three integers less than 79 that are divisible by 11 or 13 and contain the digit 7 (i.e., 66, 73, and 79).

Overall, this solution effectively counts the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than 'n' which are divisible by 11 or 13.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the input number. It is because we need to check all the integers less than 'n' to find the ones that meet the conditions
