To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Iterate through all numbers less than n.
2. Check if the number is divisible by 11 or 13.
3. If the number is divisible by 11 or 13, increment a counter.
4. Check if the digit at the unit place of the number is 7.
5. If the digit is 7, increment the counter again.
6. Return the counter value.

Here's the code that implements these steps:

```
const fizzBuzz = (n) => {
  let count = 0;
  for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    if (i % 11 === 0 || i % 13 === 0) {
      let num = i.toString();
      if (num.charAt(num.length - 1) === '7') {
        count++;
      }
    }
  }
  return count;
};
```

This code defines a function `fizzBuzz` that takes a number `n` as an argument. It initializes a counter variable `count` to 0. Then, it iterates through all numbers less than `n` using a `for` loop. For each number, it checks if it is divisible by 11 or 13 using the modulo operator `%`. If the number is divisible, it converts it to a string using the `toString` method and checks if the last character (the digit at the unit place) is 7. If it is, it increments the `count` variable. Finally, it returns the value of `count`, which represents the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than `n` which are divisible by 11 or 13.

You can test the function with the provided test cases:

```
console.log(fizzBuzz(50)); // 0
console.log(fizzBuzz(78)); // 2
console.log(fizzBuzz(79)); // 3
```

These test cases should output the expected results based on the problem statement.
