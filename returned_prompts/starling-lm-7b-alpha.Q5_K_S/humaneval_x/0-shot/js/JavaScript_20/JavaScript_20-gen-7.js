const sorted = numbers.slice().sort((a, b) => Math.abs(a - b));

return [sorted[0], sorted[1]];

In the above code, the function findClosestElements takes in a list of numbers as input. It first creates a new array called sorted by using the slice() method on the input array. The slice() method creates a new array with the same elements as the original array. The sort() method is then called on the sorted array with a comparison function that sorts the elements in ascending order based on their absolute difference. This ensures that the elements are sorted in terms of their closeness to each other. Finally, the function returns an array containing the two closest elements in the original array, in order of smaller to larger number.

For example, when the input array is [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], the sorted array becomes [2.0, 2.2, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 1.0]. The two closest elements are 2.0 and 2.2, so the function returns (2.0, 2.2) as the result.

Another example is when the input array is [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5
