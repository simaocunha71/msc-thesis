// Create a shallow copy of the array
const array = [...numbers];

// Sort the array
array.sort((a, b) => a - b);

The purpose of this function is to create a function that takes in an array of numbers and returns two elements that are closest to each other. The function accomplishes this by first creating a shallow copy of the array using the spread operator. Then, the array is sorted in ascending order using the sort method and a compare function that subtracts b from a. After the array is sorted, the two closest elements are sliced off the front of the array using the slice method. Finally, the function returns these two closest elements.

The function can be used in a test environment by calling it with a supplied list of numbers and checking the returned values. For example, when calling the function with the list [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], the function will return (2.0, 2.2). When calling the function with the list [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], the function will return (2.0, 2.0).

The function is exported so that it can be used in other modules or files.
