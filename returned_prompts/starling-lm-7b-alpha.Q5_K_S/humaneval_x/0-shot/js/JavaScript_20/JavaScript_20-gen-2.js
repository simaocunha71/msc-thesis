This function, findClosestElements, takes a list of numbers as an input and returns the two closest numbers to each other from the supplied list in order (smaller number, larger number). It first sorts the list of numbers in ascending order. If the length of the list is 2, it simply returns the two numbers. Otherwise, it initializes a variable called diff to keep track of the minimum difference between two numbers and a variable called closestPair to keep track of the closest pair of numbers. It then iterates through the sorted list of numbers and calculates the difference between each number and the next number in the list. If this difference is smaller than the current minimum difference (diff), it updates the minimum difference and the closest pair of numbers. Finally, it returns the closest pair of numbers.

For example, if we call findClosestElements with the list [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2], it will return (2.0, 2.2) because 2.0 and 2.2 are the closest numbers to each other in the list. Similarly, if we call findClosestElements with the list [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], it will return (2.0, 2.0) because 2.0 and 2.0 are the closest numbers to each other in the list.
