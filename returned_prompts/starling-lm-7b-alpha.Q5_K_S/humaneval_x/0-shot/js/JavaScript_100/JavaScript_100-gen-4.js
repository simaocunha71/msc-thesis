To solve this kata, we need to understand the pattern of the stone pile and then generate the list of the stone pile.

Let's take an example. If `n` is `3`, then the pile of stones will look like this:

```
1
3
5
```

As we can see, the number of stones in each level increases by 2 if `n` is even and by 1 if `n` is odd.

So, the logic will be to start from `n` and keep adding 1 to it if `n` is odd and 2 if `n` is even.

Here is the step by step process:

1. Initialize an empty array `pile`.
2. If `n` is odd, start from `n` and add 1 to it to create the pile. If `n` is even, start from `n` and add 2 to it to create the pile.
3. Add the current number of stones to the `pile` array.
4. If `n` is odd, increment `n` by 1. If `n` is even, increment `n` by 2.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until `n` becomes 0.
6. Return the `pile` array.

Here is the Python implementation of the above logic:

```python
def makeAPile(n):
    pile = []
    while n:
        pile.append(n)
        if n % 2 == 0:
            n += 2
        else:
            n += 1
    return pile
```

You can test the above function in Python with the following test cases:

```python
print(makeAPile(3))  # prints [3, 5, 7]
print(makeAPile(4))  # prints [4, 6, 8]
print(makeAPile(5))  # prints [5, 7, 9, 11]
print(makeAPile(6))  # prints [6, 8, 10, 12]
```

In JavaScript, you can implement the above logic as follows:

```javascript
function makeAPile(n) {
