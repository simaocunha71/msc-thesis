To solve this kata, you can follow these steps:

1. Create an empty array called 'pile' to store the number of stones in each level.
2. Use a for loop to iterate from 0 to n-1. In each iteration, check if the current level is odd or even. If it's odd, add the next odd number to the 'pile' array. If it's even, add the next even number.
3. Return the 'pile' array.

Here's the code that implements these steps:
```
const makeAPile = (n) => {
  let pile = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (i % 2 === 0) {
      pile.push(i + 2);
    } else {
      pile.push(i + 1);
    }
  }
  return pile;
};
```

By following these steps, you'll have a function that takes a positive integer 'n' as input and returns a list of the number of stones in each level of the pile, following the rules of the kata.

For example, if you call `makeAPile(3)`, it will return `[3, 5, 7]`, which represents the number of stones in each level of a pile with 3 levels, following the rules of the kata.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.
