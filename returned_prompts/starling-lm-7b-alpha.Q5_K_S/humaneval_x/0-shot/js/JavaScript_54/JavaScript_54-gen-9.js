To check if two words have the same characters, you can compare the length of the two strings first. If the lengths are not equal, then the strings cannot have the same characters. If the lengths are equal, you can then compare the characters at each index in the strings. If all the characters in both strings are the same, then the strings have the same characters. Otherwise, they do not. Here is a detailed step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. Compare the lengths of the two strings using the `length` property. If `s0.length` is not equal to `s1.length`, return `false`. This is because if the lengths are not equal, the strings cannot have the same characters.

2. If the lengths of the strings are equal, create an empty object called `chars` using the `Object` constructor. This object will be used to keep track of the count of each character in the strings.

3. Iterate over each character in the first string `s0` using a `for...of` loop. For each character, do the following:

  a. Check if the character exists as a property in the `chars` object using the `hasOwnProperty` method. If the character does not exist as a property, add it to the object and set its initial count to 1. If the character already exists as a property, increment its count by 1 using the `chars[char]++` statement.

4. After iterating over all the characters in the first string, iterate over each character in the second string `s1` using another `for...of` loop. For each character, do the following:

  a. Check if the character exists as a property in the `chars` object using the `hasOwnProperty` method. If the character does not exist as a property, return `false`. This means that the second string has a character that the first string does not have, so the strings cannot have the same characters.

  b. If the character exists as a property, decrement its count by 1 using the `chars[char]--` statement. If the count becomes 0, delete the character property from the `chars` object using the `delete` keyword. This ensures that we keep track of the count of each character correctly.

5. After iterating over all the characters in the second string, check if the `
