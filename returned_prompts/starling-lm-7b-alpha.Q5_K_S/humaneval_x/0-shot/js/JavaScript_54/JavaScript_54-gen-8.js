To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:

1. Sort the characters in both strings.
2. Compare the sorted strings. If they are equal, then the original strings have the same characters. Otherwise, they don't.
3. Return the result of the comparison.

Here's how the solution looks in code:

```python
def sameChars(s0, s1):
    # Step 1: Sort the characters in both strings
    s0 = ''.join(sorted(s0))
    s1 = ''.join(sorted(s1))

    # Step 2: Compare the sorted strings
    if s0 == s1:
        # Step 3: Return the result of the comparison
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

You can use the `sameChars` function in your code to check if two words have the same characters. The function takes two strings as input and returns `True` if the strings have the same characters, and `False` otherwise.

For example, if you call `sameChars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddeddabc')`, it will return `True` because both strings have the same characters, even though they are arranged differently. However, if you call `sameChars('eabcd', 'dddddddabc')`, it will return `False` because the characters in the two strings are not the same.

In summary, the `sameChars` function uses sorting and comparison to determine if two strings have the same characters.





/*
  Check if two words have the same characters.
  >>> sameChars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddeddabc')
  true
  >>> sameChars('abcd', 'dddddddabc')
  true
  >>> sameChars('dddddddabc', 'abcd')
  true
  >>> sameChars('eabcd', 'dddddddabc')
  false
  >>> sameChars('abcd', 'dddddddabce')
  false
  >>> sameChars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddddabc')
  false
