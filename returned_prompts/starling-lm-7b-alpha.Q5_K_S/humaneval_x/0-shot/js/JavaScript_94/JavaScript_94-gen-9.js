To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Find the largest number in the given list of integers.
2. Determine if the largest number is a prime number by checking if it is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of the number. If it is divisible by any of these numbers, then it is not a prime number.
3. If the largest number is a prime number, calculate the sum of its digits.
4. Return the sum of the digits of the largest prime number.

Here's an example implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
function largestPrime(n) {
    for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        if (isPrime(i) && n % i == 0) {
            return i;
        }
    }
}

function isPrime(n) {
    for (let i = 2; i <=
