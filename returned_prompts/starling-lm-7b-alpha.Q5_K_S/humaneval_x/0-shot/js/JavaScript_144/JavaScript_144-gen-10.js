To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Parse the input strings to get the numerator and denominator of each fraction.
2. Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators.
3. Check if the result of multiplying the numerators and the LCM of the denominators is divisible by the LCM. If it is, return true; otherwise, return false.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

Step 1: Parse the input strings
- Use the `split()` method to split the strings at the "/" delimiter and get the numerator and denominator.
- Convert the numerator and denominator to integers using the `parseInt()` function.

Step 2: Calculate the LCM of the denominators
- Initialize a variable `lcm` to 1.
- Use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD (greatest common divisor) of the denominators. The GCD is calculated as the recursive call `gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a % b)` until one of the numbers becomes 0.
- Calculate the LCM using the formula `lcm(a, b) = (a * b) / gcd(a, b)`.

Step 3: Check if the result is divisible by the LCM
- Calculate the result of multiplying the numerators and the LCM of the denominators.
- Check if the result is divisible by the LCM using the modulo operator `%`. If the result is 0, return true; otherwise, return false.

Here's the implementation of the solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
function simplify(x, n) {
  // Step 1: Parse the input strings
  let [numeratorX, denominatorX] = x.split("/").map(Number);
  let [numeratorN, denominatorN] = n.split("/").map(Number);

  // Step 2: Calculate the LCM of the denominators
  function gcd(a, b) {
    return b ? gcd(b, a % b) : a;
  }

  let lcm = (numeratorN * denominatorN) /
