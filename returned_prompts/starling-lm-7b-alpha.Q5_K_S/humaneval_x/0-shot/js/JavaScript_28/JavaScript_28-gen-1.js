The concatenate function takes an array of strings as an argument and returns a single string by concatenating all the strings. Here's how you can implement it:

```javascript
const concatenate = (strings) => {
  return strings.join('');
}
```

To use the function, simply pass in an array of strings as an argument. For example:

```javascript
console.log(concatenate([]));  // Output: ''
console.log(concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c']));  // Output: 'abc'
```

The `join('')` method is used to concatenate all the strings in the array into a single string, without any separator. 

In the first example, an empty array is passed to the function, so the result is an empty string. In the second example, the array `['a', 'b', 'c']` is passed to the function, so the result is the concatenated string `'abc'`.

This function can be used to concatenate any number of strings together, as long as they are provided as an array.

Note: Make sure to include the `join('')` method inside the `concatenate` function to achieve the desired concatenation.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.
