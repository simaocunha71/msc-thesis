// I'm having trouble understanding the logic of this code.
// The encodeShift function takes a string and maps each character to a new character that is 5 places ahead of it in the alphabet.
// The decodeShift function takes a string, and maps each character back to its original position in the alphabet,
// by subtracting 5 from the character code.
// In both functions, the characters are joined back together to form the final string.
// The test cases show that the functions work correctly.

The logic of this code is to create a simple encoding and decoding scheme for a string. The encodeShift function takes a string and shifts each character by 5 positions in the alphabet. This is done by converting each character to its corresponding ASCII code, adding 5, taking the modulus of 26 (since there are 26 letters in the alphabet), and then converting the result back to a character. The resulting characters are joined together to form the encoded string.

The decodeShift function takes a string that has been encoded using the encodeShift function and reverses the process. Each character is converted to its ASCII code, subtracts 5, takes the modulus of 26, and then converts the result back to a character. The resulting characters are joined together to form the decoded string.

The test cases provided demonstrate that the encodeShift and decodeShift functions work correctly. When the encodeShift function is applied to the string "zebra", it returns "dvetk". When the decodeShift function is applied to the string "dvetk", it returns "zebra".

Overall, this code provides a simple and effective way to encode and decode strings using a shift cipher.

Here are some additional details about the code:

- The encodeShift function uses the map method to iterate over each character in the input string. The map method
