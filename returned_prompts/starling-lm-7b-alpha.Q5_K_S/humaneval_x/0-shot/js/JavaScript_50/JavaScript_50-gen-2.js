I'm trying to understand the code provided. It seems to be a simple shift cipher, but I'm not sure how the `String.fromCharCode()` function is used to encode and decode the input.

It's also unclear to me what `ch.charCodeAt(0)` is doing. I understand that `ch` is a character in the string `s`, but what does the `charCodeAt(0)` function do and how does it relate to `String.fromCharCode()`?

Lastly, it's unclear to me why the shift is only by 5 positions in the alphabet. Why not another number, such as 3, 6, or 7?

Here are my specific questions:

1. How does the `String.fromCharCode()` function work in the context of the provided code?
2. What is `ch.charCodeAt(0)` and how does it relate to `String.fromCharCode()`?
3. Why is the shift in the alphabet only by 5 positions?

Here's a breakdown of my questions:

1. In the `encodeShift` function, the `String.fromCharCode()` function is used to convert a Unicode scalar value to a character. However, in this specific code, it's not clear how the function is used to encode the input. Can you explain the purpose of the `String.fromCharCode()` function in the context of this code?

2. The `ch.charCodeAt(0)` function is used to get the Unicode scalar value of the character `ch`. It's used in the `encodeShift` function to calculate the new Unicode scalar value of the character after the shift. However, it's not clear how this value relates to `String.fromCharCode()`. Can you explain how the `charCodeAt(0)` function is used in the context of this code?

3. The shift in the alphabet is only by 5 positions because the original code was designed to be a simple example of a shift cipher. The number 5 was chosen arbitrarily to demonstrate the concept of shifting characters in the alphabet. In a real-world scenario, the shift could be any number, depending on the desired level of encryption.
