I understand that the `encodeShift` function takes in a string and returns a new string with every character shifted by 5 in the alphabet. However, I'm not sure about the logic behind the `decodeShift` function. How does this function work and what does it do with the input string `s`?

The `decodeShift` function is designed to take an encoded string that was generated by the `encodeShift` function and decrypt it back to the original string. The logic behind the function is based on the Caesar cipher, which is a type of substitution cipher.

In the `decodeShift` function, the input string `s` is processed using the `map` method. This method applies a transformation to each character in the string and returns a new array with the transformed characters. The transformation is done using the `String.fromCharCode` method, which converts a Unicode character code to its corresponding character.

To decode the string, the function needs to reverse the shift applied in the `encodeShift` function. The shift is applied by taking the character code of each character in the string and subtracting the shift value (5 in this case) from it. However, since the shift value is subtracted, it may result in a negative number. To handle this, the function uses the modulo operator (%) to ensure that the result is always a non-negative number. The modulo operation is performed with respect to the number of letters in the alphabet (26), as there are 26 letters in the English alphabet.

After the modulo operation, the character code is converted back to its corresponding character using the `String.fromCharCode` method. The `join` method is then used to concatenate all the decoded characters back into a single string.

Overall, the `decodeShift` function works by reversing the shift applied in the `encodeShift` function, allowing the decoded string to be obtained from the encoded string.

Here is a breakdown of the `decodeShift` function:

1. The `map` method is used to apply a transformation to each character in the input string `s`.
2. For each character, the character code is obtained using `charCodeAt(0)`.
3. The shift value (5) is subtracted from the character code, potentially resulting in a negative number.
