*/

In the above code, the function encodeShift is designed to return the encoded string by shifting each character by five in the alphabet. The function decodeShift, on the other hand, is designed to take a string that has been encoded using the encodeShift function and return the decoded string.

To achieve the encoding, the function encodeShift uses the split() method to split the input string into an array of characters. Then, it uses the map() method to iterate over each character in the array and apply the following transformation:

- The charCodeAt(0) method is used to get the Unicode value of the character.
- The value is incremented by 5.
- The modulo operator (%) is used to ensure that the value wraps around to the beginning of the alphabet if it goes beyond 'z'.
- The value is added to the Unicode value of 'a' to get the Unicode value of the encoded character.
- The fromCharCode() method is used to convert the Unicode value back to a character.
- The result is joined back into a string using the join() method.

The decodeShift function uses a similar process but subtracts 5 from the Unicode value instead of adding it. This undoes the shift and returns the original character.

When the provided test cases are run, the output is:

encodeShift("cats"): "fqhb"
decodeShift("fqhb"): "cats"

This confirms that the encodeShift and decodeShift functions are working correctly.
