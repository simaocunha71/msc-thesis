I am trying to understand the provided code.

1. What does the `encodeShift` function do?
2. What does the `decodeShift` function do?

Here's what I understood:

1. The `encodeShift` function takes a string `s` and returns an encoded string by shifting every character by 5 in the alphabet. It does this by splitting the string into an array of characters using `split("")`. Then, for each character `ch` in the array, it uses the `map` method to convert the character's ASCII code to the corresponding character using `String.fromCharCode`. It then shifts the ASCII code of the character by 5 and wraps it around if it goes beyond the alphabet by using the modulo operator `%`. Finally, it joins the array of characters back into a string using `join("")` and returns the encoded string.

2. The `decodeShift` function takes a string `s` encoded with the `encodeShift` function and returns the decoded string. It is not provided in the code, so I cannot explain how it works. However, based on the explanation of the `encodeShift` function, I can infer that the `decodeShift` function would need to reverse the process of shifting the characters back by 5 in the alphabet to decode the message.

As for the question you asked, the `encodeShift` function is used to encode a message by shifting every character by 5 in the alphabet, while the `decodeShift` function is used to decode a message that has been encoded using the `encodeShift` function.

Here's an example usage of the `encodeShift` function:

```javascript
console.log(encodeShift("abc")); // "fmq"
```

Here's an example usage of the `decodeShift` function (assuming it exists):

```javascript
console.log(decodeShift("fmq")); // "abc"
```

The `encodeShift` function takes a string `s` and returns an encoded string by shifting every character by 5 in the alphabet. This is done by splitting the string into an array of characters using the `split("")` method. Then, for each character `ch` in the array, the `map` method is used to convert the character's ASC
