Here is a solution to the problem:

To solve this problem, you will need to first convert the hexadecimal number to a decimal number. Then, you can use a function to determine if a number is prime or not. Finally, you will count the number of prime digits in the hexadecimal number.

The function hexKey takes a hexadecimal number as a string as an input and returns the number of prime hexadecimal digits in the input. The function first converts the hexadecimal number to a decimal number using the parseInt function.

Then, a while loop is used to iterate through all the numbers from 2 to hexNum (the decimal number). For each number, the isPrime function is called to determine if the number is prime. If the number is prime, the variable primes is incremented by 1.

The isPrime function takes a
