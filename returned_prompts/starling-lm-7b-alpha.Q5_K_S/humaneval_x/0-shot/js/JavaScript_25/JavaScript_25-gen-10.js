To solve this Kata, you'll need to factorize the input number into its prime factors.

Here are some tips to get you started:

1. To factorize a number, you can start dividing by the smallest prime number. If it divides evenly, divide the number by the quotient and continue. If it doesn't divide evenly, increase the prime number and repeat the process. Repeat until the number is 1.
2. To find the prime numbers, you can use a loop that starts at 2 and increases by 1 until reaching the square root of the input number. Inside the loop, you can check if the number is prime using another loop. If it is, add it to a list and continue. If it's not, skip to the next number. Repeat until the loop is finished.
3. To count the number of times each prime factor appears in the factorization, you can initialize an empty object called "counts" and add each prime factor as a key with an initial value of 0. After finding each factor, increment its count by 1.
4. To sort the prime factors in ascending order, you can use the `sort` method of the array. Pass a comparison function to the `sort` method that compares the values of each prime factor object. The comparison function should return a negative value if the prime factor at index 0 is smaller, 0 if they are equal, and a positive value if the prime factor at index 0 is larger. Repeat until the array is sorted.
5. To convert the array of prime factor objects to an array of values, you can use the `map` method of the array. Pass a mapping function to the `map` method that returns the value of each prime factor object. Repeat until the array is mapped.
6. To return the array of prime factor values, you can use the `return` statement followed by the array of values. Repeat until the function is finished.

Here's an example implementation of the solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
const factorize = (n) => {
  const counts = {};
  let divisor = 2;
  while (n > 1) {
    while (n % divisor === 0) {
      counts[divisor] = (counts[divisor] || 0) +
