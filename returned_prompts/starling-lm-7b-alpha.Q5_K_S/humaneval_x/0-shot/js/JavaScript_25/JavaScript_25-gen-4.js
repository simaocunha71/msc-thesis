To solve this kata, you need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize an empty object `counts` to store the count of each prime factor.
2. Initialize an empty array `primes` to store the factors.
3. Initialize an empty array `factors` to store the factors.
4. Initialize a variable `i` as 2. This variable will be used to iterate through the numbers from 2 to n.
5. While `i` is less than or equal to `n`, check if `n` is divisible by `i` using the modulo operator (%). If it is divisible, increment the count of `i` in the `counts` object and append `i` to the `factors` array. Also, update `n` by dividing it by `i`.
6. After the while loop, iterate through the `factors` array. For each factor `f`, check if it is already present in the `primes` array. If not, push `f` into the `primes` array.
7. Finally, return the `primes` array.

Here's the code:

```javascript
const factorize = (n) => {
  let counts = {};
  let primes = [];
  let factors = [];
  let i = 2;

  while (i <= n) {
    if (n % i === 0) {
      counts[i] = (counts[i] || 0) + 1;
      factors.push(i);
      n /= i;
    } else {
      i++;
    }
  }

  factors.forEach(f => {
    if (!primes.includes(f)) {
      primes.push(f);
    }
  });

  return primes;
};
```

This code will return the list of prime factors of the given integer in the order from smallest to largest, with each factor listed the number of times it appears in the factorization.

For example, if you call `factorize(8)`, it will return `[2, 2, 2]`, if you call `factorize(25)`, it will return `[5, 5]`, and if you call `factorize
