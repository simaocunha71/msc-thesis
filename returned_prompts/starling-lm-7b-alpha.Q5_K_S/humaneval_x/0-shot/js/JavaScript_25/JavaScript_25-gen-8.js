One approach to solve this problem is to use the factorization method. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Initialize an empty array to store the prime factors.
2. Use a for loop to iterate through each possible factor of the given number (starting from 2).
3. Check if the current number is a factor of the given number. If it is, add it to the prime factors array and divide the given number by the factor.
4. Repeat steps 3 until the given number is reduced to 1.
5. Return the prime factors array.

Here's a Python implementation of the above approach:

```python
def factorize(n):
    factors = []
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors.append(2)
        n = n / 2
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        while n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n = n / i
    if n > 2:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

You can use this function to factorize any positive integer. For example, to factorize the number 8, you can call `factorize(8)`, which will return `[2, 2, 2]`.

This function works by repeatedly dividing the given number by the smallest prime factor it has. It keeps track of all the factors it finds in an array and returns the array once all the factors have been found.

The time complexity of this function is O(sqrt(n)), where n is the number being factorized. This is because, for each iteration of the outer for loop, the inner while loop will at most run sqrt(n) times.

The space complexity of this function is O(log(n)), where n is the number being factorized. This is because the maximum number of factors a number can have is equal to its logarithm base 2.

Overall, this function provides an efficient and accurate way to factorize a given number.

The provided Python implementation is a simple and efficient way to factorize a number. It starts by dividing the number by 2 repeatedly as long as it is divisible by 2. Then, it moves
