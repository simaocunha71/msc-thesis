One way to solve this problem is to use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate all the prime numbers up to the square root of the input number. Then iterate through the list of prime numbers and divide the input number by each prime until the input number is 1. Keep track of the count of each prime that divides the input number and return the list of prime factors in the order from smallest to largest, each with the count of how many times it appears in the factorization. Here's the step-by-step explanation and code example:

1. Generate a list of prime numbers using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. This algorithm works by iteratively marking the multiples of each prime number starting from 2. The numbers that are not marked are prime. We only need to generate primes up to the square root of the input number to optimize the time complexity.

2. Iterate through the list of prime numbers and divide the input number by each prime. Keep track of the count of each prime that divides the input number.

3. Return the list of prime factors in the order from smallest to largest, each with the count of how many times it appears in the factorization.

Here's the Python code to implement the above steps:

```python
def sieve(n):
    # Generate a list of prime numbers up to the square root of the input number
    primes = [True] * (n + 1)
    primes[0] = primes[1] = False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if primes[i]:
            for j in range(i * i, n + 1, i):
                primes[j] = False
    return [i for i in range(n + 1) if primes[i]]

def factorize(n):
    # Generate the list of prime numbers up to the square root of the input number
    primes = sieve(int(n ** 0.5) + 1)
    # Initialize the result list
    result = []
    # Iterate through the list of prime numbers
    for prime in primes:
        # Check if the prime divides the input number
        while n % prime ==
