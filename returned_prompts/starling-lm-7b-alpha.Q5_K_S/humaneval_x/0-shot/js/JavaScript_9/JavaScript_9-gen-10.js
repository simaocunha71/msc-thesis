rollingMax([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2]);

// The above code will return [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4].

The provided code generates a list of rolling maximum elements from the given list of integers. The function "rollingMax" takes an array of integers as an input parameter. It initializes an empty array called "rollingMaxArr" to store the rolling maximum values. It also initializes a variable "max" to keep track of the maximum value found so far.

The function then iterates through each element of the input array using a for loop. For each element, it compares the element with the current maximum value stored in the "max" variable. If the element is greater than the current maximum, it updates the "max" variable to the new maximum value.

After updating the maximum value if necessary, it pushes the current maximum value to the "rollingMaxArr" array using the "push" method. This way, the rolling maximum value is added to the array at each iteration.

Finally, the function returns the "rollingMaxArr" array, which contains all the rolling maximum values until the given moment in the sequence.

In the provided example, the function is called with the input array [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2]. The resulting output is [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4], which represents the rolling maximum values for each moment in the sequence.

The code uses a simple and efficient approach to generate the rolling maximum values by keeping track of the maximum value and updating it whenever a larger value is found. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array, as it iterates through the array only once.

Overall, the provided solution effectively solves the problem of generating a list of rolling maximum elements
