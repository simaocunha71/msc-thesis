In this context, a distributed system is a system that consists of multiple components, each capable of interacting with other components.

The shell script must be able to perform the following operations:

- Obtain the current time, in seconds since the Unix epoch.
- Check if the current time is a multiple of 24 hours (86400 seconds).
- If the current time is a multiple of 24 hours, the script must generate a new encryption key.
- The script must then securely transmit the new encryption key to all components in the distributed system.
- The script must also ensure that the encryption key used in the previous 24-hour period is no longer valid.

To accomplish this, you can use the following shell script as a starting point:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Function to obtain the current time in seconds since the Unix epoch
get_current_time() {
  return $(date +%s)
}

# Function to check if the current time is a multiple of 24 hours (86400 seconds)
is_multiple_of_24_hours() {
  current_time=$1
  ((current_time % 86400)) && return 1
  return 0
}

# Function to generate a new encryption key
generate_new_key() {
  # Your implementation for generating a new encryption key goes here
  echo "New encryption key generated."
}

# Function to securely transmit the new encryption key to all components in the distributed system
transmit_new_key() {
  # Your implementation for securely transmitting the new encryption key goes here
  echo "New encryption key transmitted to all components."
}

# Main script
get_current_time
is_multiple_of_24_hours $? && {
  generate_new_key
  transmit_new_key
}
```

Please note that the `generate_new_key` and `transmit_new_key` functions in the provided script are placeholders and should be replaced with your own implementation.

Here are some points to consider when implementing these functions:

- The `generate_new_key` function should use a secure and cryptographically strong algorithm
