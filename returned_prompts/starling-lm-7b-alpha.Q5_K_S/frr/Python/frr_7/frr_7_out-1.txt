To use this script, you can pass the input file containing IP addresses as a command-line argument. The script will read the IP addresses from the file, calculate the risk score for each IP address using the customized algorithm, and block any IP addresses with a risk score above the specified threshold. The script also includes a mechanism for updating the risk assessment model based on new threat intelligence data.

Please note that the `calculate_risk
