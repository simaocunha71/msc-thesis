- The system consists of a number of nodes, each of which stores a secret key used for encryption.
- At any given time, only a subset of nodes have the secret key.
- The secret key is used to encrypt messages sent between nodes.
- The system needs to be able to send messages between nodes, so it must be able to send messages to nodes that do not have the secret key.
