Answer: There are a few projects that you can look at to get an idea of how this could be done:

https://github.com/slackhq/python-signature-validator
https://github.com/iSECPartners/pcap2c-ng

For a start, you could use the second link to extract the signature of the packets and then use the first link to see if the signature is in the database.

For the machine learning part, you could use a library like scikit-learn to classify the signatures.

For the adaptive part, you could use a database that is constantly updated by a human analyst.

As for the modularity, you can use the database as a module that is imported in your code.
