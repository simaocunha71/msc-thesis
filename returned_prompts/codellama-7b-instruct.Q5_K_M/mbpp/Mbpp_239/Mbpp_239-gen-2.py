"""
The number of possible sequences of length n, such that each element is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to twice the previous element but less than or equal to m, is given by the following formula:

n = 1
m = 10

1. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
2. 1 2 4 6 8 10

The number of possible sequences of length n is given by the formula:

(n + m) choose n

In the above example, we have:

n = 10
m = 10

So the number of possible sequences is:

(n + m) choose n = (10 + 10) choose 10 = 35 choose 10 = 16,777,216

Therefore, the number of possible sequences of length n, such that each element is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to twice the previous element but less than or equal to m, is 16,777,216.
