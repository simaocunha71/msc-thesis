    <ul>
      <li>The formula is for the volume of a cone, where the formula is V = (1/3)πr^2h.</li>
      <li>The function takes two parameters radius (r) and height (h).</li>
      <li>math.pi is a built-in constant for π.</li>
      <li>** is the power operator, which computes the power of the operand with the exponent.</li>
      <li>/ is the division operator, which divides the first operand by the second operand.</li>
      <li>// is the floor division operator, which divides the first operand by the second operand and rounds down to the nearest integer.</li>
      <li>// is the modulo operator, which computes the remainder of dividing the first operand by the second operand.</li>
      <li>// is the bitwise XOR operator, which computes the bitwise XOR of the two operands.</li>
      <li>// is the bitwise AND operator, which computes the bitwise AND of the two operands.</li>
      <li>// is the bitwise OR operator, which computes the bitwise OR of the two operands.</li>
      <li>// is the bitwise NOT operator, which inverts all the bits in the operand.</li>
    </ul>
