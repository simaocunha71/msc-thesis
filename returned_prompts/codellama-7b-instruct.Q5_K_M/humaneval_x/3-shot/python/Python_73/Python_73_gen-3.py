    # first find the smallest palindrome
    # then compare it to the input array
    # and count the number of changes
    # to get the smallest change

    # find the smallest palindrome
    # to do that we need to find the longest
    # common prefix of the array and reverse of the array
    # we can do that in linear time

    # compare the smallest palindrome with the input array
    # and count the number of changes

    # return the number of changes
