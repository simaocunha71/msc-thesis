In this problem, you will implement a function that takes a vector of numbers,

In this problem, you will implement a function that takes two vectors of numbers,
and determines whether it is possible to perform an exchange of elements
between them to make the elements of the first vector all even.
There is no limit on the number of exchanged elements between the two vectors.
If it is possible to exchange elements between the two vectors to make all the
elements of the first vector to be even, return "YES".
Otherwise, return "NO".
For example:
exchange({1, 2, 3, 4}, {1, 2, 3, 4}) => "YES"
exchange({1, 2, 3, 4}, {1, 5, 3, 4}) => "NO"
It is assumed that the input vectors will be non-empty.
