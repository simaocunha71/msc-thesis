/*
Given a string s, you have been tasked to implement a function that returns 
a vector of all words from string s in the order they appear in the string s.
If the string s is empty then the function should return an empty vector.
Note: you may assume the input string contains only letters and spaces.
Examples:
select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 4) ==> {"little"}
select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 3) ==> {"Mary", "lamb"}
select_words('simple white space", 2) ==> {}
select_words("Hello world", 4) ==> {"world"}
select_words("Uncle sam", 3) ==> {"Uncle"}
