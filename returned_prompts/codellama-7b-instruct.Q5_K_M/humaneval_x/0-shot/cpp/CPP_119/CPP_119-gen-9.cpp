/*
You are given a vector of integers. Each integer represents the
number of apples a person owns. Your job is to find the
number of different pairs of people that have the same
number of apples. For example:
vector<int> v = {10, 5, 20, 5, 10};
The result should be 2.

Examples:
count_pairs({10, 5, 20, 5, 10}) == 2
