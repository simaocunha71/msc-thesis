Write a function named is_leap_year that takes a year as its only parameter and 
returns a boolean indicating whether the year is a leap year. 

A leap year is a year that is divisible by 4.

A year is also a leap year if it is divisible by 400.

However, years that are divisible by 100 are not leap years unless they are also 
divisible by 400.

1990, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2020, 2024 are leap years
