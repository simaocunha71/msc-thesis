This problem is quite simple. We can solve this problem using two steps.
First, we need to reverse the string s and delete all the characters in s that are equal to any character in c.
Then we need to reverse the string again to check if it is a palindrome.

B:

In this step, we need to check if the string is a palindrome. We can do this by reversing the string again and check if it is equal to the original string. If it is not equal, we can return "False". If it is equal, we can return "True".
