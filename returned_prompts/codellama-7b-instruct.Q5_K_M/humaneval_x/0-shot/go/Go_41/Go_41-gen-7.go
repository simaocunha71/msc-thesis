// The cars on the left are moving to the right and the cars on the right are
// moving to the left.  If they ever meet, they will collide.  There are n cars
// on the left and n cars on the right.

// The first car on the left will collide with the last car on the right.
// The last car on the left will collide with the first car on the right.
// The first car on the right will collide with the last car on the left.
// The last car on the right will collide with the first car on the left.
// The cars on the left and right meet at the middle point.

// So, there are n + n + 1 = 2n collisions.

// This is a classic problem.  You can solve it in two ways:

// 1.  Count all the collisions.
// 2.  Count the number of cars that never collide.

// In this case, the number of cars that never collide is n / 2.

// The cars on the left and right meet at the middle point.
// The cars on the left and right are moving in the same direction.
// There are n cars on the left and n cars on the right.
// So, there are n + n = 2n cars on the left and right.

// The cars on the left and right meet at the middle point.
// The cars on the left and right are moving in the same direction.
// There are n cars on the left and n cars on the right.
// So, there are n + n = 2n cars on the left and right.

// There are n + n = 2n cars that never collide.

// So, the number of collisions is 2n - n = n collisions.

// This is a classic problem.  You can solve it in two ways:
