// 1.  Let's make a diagram to help us visualize this.  Let's say n = 3.  We'll draw
//     three cars lined up side by side.  The two cars that are moving left to right
//     are A and B.  The car that's moving right to left is C.

// 2.  We'll make the assumption that all cars are initially at the same distance
//     from the starting point.  So, we'll assume that A, B, and C are all at the
//     same x coordinate.  We'll call that x coordinate "start".

// 3.  We'll assume that A, B, and C are all moving in the same direction,
//     right to left.  So, we'll assume that A, B, and C are all moving in the
//     same direction.

// 4.  We'll assume that A, B, and C are all moving at the same speed.

// 5.  We'll assume that A, B, and C are all infinitely sturdy and strong.

// 6.  We'll assume that there are no other cars on the road.

// 7.  We'll assume that we're not taking into account any other factors that
//     might cause a collision.  For example, we won't assume that A, B, and C
//     are all moving in the same direction for the entire duration of the race.
//     We won't assume that A, B, and C are all moving in the same direction
//     for the entire duration of the race.

// 8.  We'll assume that we're only considering the collision between A and C.
//     We won't consider any collisions between B and C, or between A and B.

// 9.  We'll assume that the road is a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
//     We won't consider any other factors that might cause a collision, such as
//     any other cars that might be on the road.

// 10. We'll assume that the cars are all moving in the same direction,
//     right to left.
