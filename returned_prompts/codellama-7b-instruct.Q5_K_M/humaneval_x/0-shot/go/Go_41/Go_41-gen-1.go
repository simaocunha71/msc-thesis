// This is a classic problem.  It's actually called the collision problem.
// It's a simple problem.  It has a simple solution.  It has a simple proof.
// 
// Let's start with the proof.
// 
// Suppose that the number of collisions is k.
// That means that the two cars that collided are the k-th and k+1-th cars.
// They are driving left to right and right to left, respectively.
// 
// Now, the k-th car is moving left to right.
// The k+1-th car is moving right to left.
// 
// So, the k-th car is the k-th car from the left.
// The k+1-th car is the k+1-th car from the right.
// 
// Now, the k-th car and the k+1-th car are moving in the same direction.
// They are moving in the same direction as each other.
// 
// So, the k-th car is at a point that is k units to the left of the origin.
// The k+1-th car is at a point that is k+1 units to the right of the origin.
// 
// Now, the k-th car has a speed of 1.
// The k+1-th car has a speed of -1.
// 
// So, the k-th car is moving 1 unit to the left at a speed of 1.
// The k+1-th car is moving 1 unit to the right at a speed of -1.
// 
// So, the k-th car is moving 1 unit to the left at a speed of 1.
// The k+1-th car is moving 1 unit to the right at a speed of -1.
// 
// The distance between the k-th car and the k+1-th car is k-k-1 = k.
// 
// So, the k-th car is k units to the left of the origin.
// The k+1-th car is k units to the right of the origin.
// 
// And the distance between the k-th car and the k+1-th car is k.
