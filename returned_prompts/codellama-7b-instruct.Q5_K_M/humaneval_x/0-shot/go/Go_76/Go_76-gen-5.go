// This function is actually quite simple.
// We only need to check whether n**int is equal to x.
// If we can do this in constant time, then we can say that this function is O(1).

// This function is O(1) because we only have to do one operation:
// n**int (constant time)

// We can check whether n**int is equal to x in constant time by using the power operator.
// So, this function is O(1) because it takes constant time to perform n**int.

// We can also check whether n**int is equal to x by using the modulo operator.
// This function will be O(1) because it takes constant time to perform n**int.

// So, this function is O(1) because it takes constant time to perform n**int.

// This function is O(1) because it takes constant time to perform n**int.

// This function is O(1) because it takes constant time to perform n**int.
