// The solution:

// 1. Split the string by spaces to get an array of strings.
// 2. Loop over the array and parse each string into an array of runes.
// 3. Loop over the array of runes and check each rune against the legend.
// 4. If the rune is found in the legend then multiply the current element of the output array by the length
//    of the rune, otherwise add 1 to the current element of the output array.
