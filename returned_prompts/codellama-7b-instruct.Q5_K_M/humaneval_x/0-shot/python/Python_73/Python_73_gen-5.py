This problem is a bit tricky. We need to find the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array palindromic. We can do this by iterating over the array and keeping track of the number of elements we need to change.

The first thing we need to do is define a function that checks if the given array is palindromic. This means that we need to check if the array is equal to itself read backwards. We can do this by simply checking if the array is equal to the array read backwards.

The second thing we need to do is define a function that counts the number of elements that need to be changed to make the array palindromic. This means that we need to iterate over the array and count the number of elements that are not equal to the corresponding element in the backwards array.

The third thing we need to do is call the `count_changes` function with the `arr` parameter. If the array is palindromic, we return 0. Otherwise, we return the number of changes we need to make.

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
