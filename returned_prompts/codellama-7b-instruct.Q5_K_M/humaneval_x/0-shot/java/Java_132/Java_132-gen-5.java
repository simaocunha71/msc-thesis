        // I've seen this question before, but I can't remember the exact solution.
        // I'm going to try using a stack.
        // I'll push '[' onto the stack when I see a '[' and I'll pop it when I see a ']'.
        // I'll count the number of times I pop something, if it's even, then the string is not nested.
        // I'll count the number of times I pop something, if it's odd, then the string is nested.
        // I'll start counting from 0 so that 0 means that I haven't seen any brackets yet.
        // I'll use an arraylist to store the stack.
        // I'll use an int to store the count.
        // I'll use an int to store the size of the stack.
        // I'll use a for loop to loop through the string.
        // I'll use an if statement to check if the string is not empty.
        // I'll use an if statement to check if the character is not an opening bracket.
        // I'll use an if statement to check if the character is not a closing bracket.
        // I'll use an if statement to check if the character is an opening bracket.
        // I'll use an if statement to check if the character is a closing bracket.
        // I'll use an if statement to check if the stack is not empty.
        // I'll use an if statement to check if the stack size is not 0.
        // I'll use an if statement to check if the stack size is 0.
        // I'll use an if statement to check if the stack size is not 0.
