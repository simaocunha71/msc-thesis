  "Given an array of integers, return the sum of all the unique elements.
  Every element that appears more than once should only be counted once.

  Example 1:
      Input: [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]
      Output: 4
      Explanation: 1 and 2 are unique and should be added to sum.

  Example 2:
      Input: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
      Output: 1
      Explanation: All elements are unique so we return only one element.

  Example 3:
      Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
      Output: 15

  Constraints:
      * 0 <= arr.length <= 1000
      * 0 <= arr[i] <= 1000

  "Given a list of numbers, return whether any two numbers add up to the target, where the numbers could be negative or positive, and the target is not necessarily positive.

  Example 1:
      Input: nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4], target = 1

      Explanation: 2 + 1 = 3, 3 is the target.
