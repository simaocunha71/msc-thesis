/*You are given two integers, a and b, which represent the lower and upper bounds of a closed interval. Your task is to find the length of the interval.
  The interval is closed, which means that the lower bound is included and the upper bound is included.
  Example:
  Input: a = 0, b = 2
  Output: 2
  Explanation:
  The length of the interval is 2.
  Note that the interval [0, 2] is closed, which means that 0 and 2 are included in the interval.

/*You are given an array of integers, and you have to find the maximum sum of a subarray.
  A subarray is a contiguous part of the array.
  The function should return the maximum sum of the subarray.
  Example:
  Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  Output: 15
  Explanation:
  The maximum sum of a subarray is 15, which is obtained by choosing the subarray [3, 4, 5].
  If the input is an empty array, the function should return 0.

C:
/*You are given an array of integers, and you have to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
  A contiguous subarray is a subarray where each element is either in the original array or is equal to the sum of the elements that are immediately before it in the array.
  For example, the following array has a contiguous subarray with the maximum sum: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
  The subarray is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
  The function should return the maximum sum of the contiguous subarray.
  If the input is an empty array, the function should return 0.
  Example:
  Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
  Output: 21
  Explanation:
  The maximum sum of a contiguous subarray is
