  Given an array of integers, find the pair of numbers that add up to a given target number.

  Example:

      Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6], target = 7

  Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer in linear time and constant space.

  In other words, find the lowest positive integer that does not exist in the array.

  The array can contain duplicates and negative numbers as well.

  Example:

      Input: [1, 2, 0]
      Output: 3

  Constraints:
      1. 1 <= len(arr) <= 1000

/*
  Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number)

  A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

  Example:

      Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
      Output: 6
      Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.

  Follow up: If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

  Constraints:
      - 1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104
      - -105 <= nums[i] <= 105
