/*
  Given an array arr of integers, calculate the ratios of sorted, 
  rev-sorted, and original arrays.

  Example 1:

      Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
      Output: [1.2, 1.2, 1.0, 0.8, 0.6]

  Note:
      1. arr will have a length in the range [1, 12].
      2. The elements of arr will all be in the range [0, 1e7].

/*
  Given an array of integers, determine whether a sum of 2 numbers 
  equals a third number.

  Example 1:

      Input: nums = [10, 15, 3, 7]
      Output: true
      Explanation: 10 + 7 = 3 is true.

  Example 2:

      Input: nums = [10, 15, 3, 7]
      Output: false
      Explanation: 10 + 8 = 18, while 18 is not equal to 3.

  Note:
      1. nums.length <= 5000
      2. 0 < nums[i] < 1000
      3. 0 <= target <= 1000

  Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it and return

  Example 1:

      Input: "leetcode"

  Example 2:
