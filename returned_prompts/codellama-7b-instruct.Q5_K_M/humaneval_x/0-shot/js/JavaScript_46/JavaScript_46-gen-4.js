/*The Fibonacci number sequence is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the previous two numbers.  The sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two previous numbers.  For example: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ... 

Write a function that takes a number n and returns the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence.  Do not use recursion.  */
