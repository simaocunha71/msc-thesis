  The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers where every number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. 
  The first two numbers of the sequence are 0 and 1. The sequence goes on like this: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34...
  The fibonacci sequence is a mathematical sequence that can be described like this:
    fibonacci(0) = 0
    fibonacci(1) = 1
    fibonacci(n) = fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
  So, the first few elements of the sequence are:
    fibonacci(0) = 0
    fibonacci(1) = 1
    fibonacci(2) = 1
    fibonacci(3) = 2
    fibonacci(4) = 3
    fibonacci(5) = 5
    fibonacci(6) = 8
    fibonacci(7) = 13
    fibonacci(8) = 21
  The fibonacci sequence grows exponentially. It is a very large sequence, and it grows so fast that it is not possible to calculate the sequence for n > 47.
  But, there are some special Fibonacci sequences that can be calculated. 
  The Fibonacci sequence is a very important mathematical sequence. It is used in computer science, mathematics, and many other fields.
