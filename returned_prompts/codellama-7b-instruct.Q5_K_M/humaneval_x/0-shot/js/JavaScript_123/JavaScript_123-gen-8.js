  I'll need to write a recursive function to get the collatz sequence.
  I'll have to check if n is even or odd.
  If n is odd, I'll get the next number of the sequence, and then check if this next number is odd.
  If it's odd, I'll get the next number, and check if this number is odd.
  If the number is even, I'll get the half of the number, and check if this number is odd.
  If the number is odd, I'll get the next number, and check if this number is odd.
  If the number is even, I'll get the half of the number, and check if this number is odd.
  If the number is odd, I'll get the next number, and check if this number is odd.
