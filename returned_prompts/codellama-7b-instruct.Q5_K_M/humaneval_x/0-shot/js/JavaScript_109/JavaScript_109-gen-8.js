/*
  Given an array of integers where every integer occurs three times except
  for one integer, which only occurs once. Find and return the non-occurring
  integer.
  For example, [4, 3, 6, 6, 6, 2, 1, 1] gives 5 because only 5 does not occur
  exactly 3 times.
  Do this in O(N) time and constant space.
