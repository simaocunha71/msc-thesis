/*
  Write the code that returns the product of the unit digits of the given 
  integers.
  For example, 148 and 412 have the unit digits 1, 4, 8, and 2, 
  respectively. So, if we multiply 1 and 2, we get 2, multiply 4 and 8, 
  we get 32, and multiply 1 and 5, we get 5. So, the function 
  multiply(148, 412) should return 32 + 5 = 37.
