/*
  You are given an array of integers a, 
  and two integers lo and hi. 
  Return the number of triples (a[i], a[j], a[k]) where i < j < k, and lo â‰¤ a[i] + a[j] + a[k] â‰¤ hi.

  Example :
      Input: a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], lo = 1, hi = 10
      Output: 2
      Explanation: The two triples are (1, 2, 3) and (4, 5, 6).

  Note:
      a.length == n
      1 <= n <= 1000
      1 <= a[i] <= 10^9
      1 <= lo <= hi <= 10^9

  Hints:
      Try to use binary search.

  Note:
      The problem is to find all triples in an array.
      We can use a hash table to store the values in the array.
      We can also use a hash table to store the sums of the triplets.
      We can use a hash table to store the sums of the triplets and the number of times they appear.
