    Note that the web browser must be launched in a separate process so that the web browser
    can run in parallel with your Java program.

    Hint: Use the Runtime.getRuntime().exec() method to launch the web browser.

    Note: The URL parameter should be a string literal, not a variable.

    Note: The Runtime.getRuntime().exec() method returns a Process object, which can be used to
    determine whether the operation was successful.

    The Runtime.getRuntime().exec() method returns a Process object, which can be used to
    determine whether the operation was successful.

    The Process object has a waitFor() method, which returns an integer value indicating the
    exit status of the launched process.

    The waitFor() method returns an integer value indicating the exit status of the launched
    process.

    The exit status is a positive value if the launched process terminated normally, and a
    negative value if it terminated with an error.

    The waitFor() method also throws an InterruptedException if the thread is interrupted
    while it is waiting for the launched process to terminate.

    Note: The Runtime.getRuntime().exec() method also throws an IOException if the
    launched process cannot be started.

    Note: The Runtime.getRuntime().exec() method also throws an IOException if the
    launched process exits abnormally.
